# Running this app
node index.js or npm start (to run in background)

# run ngrok

ngrok http 5050
if that fails then add authorization by going to ngrok website, login and copy auth
add the url to twilio

# Future improvements
Make it be https by using a domain then do the steps to make twilio point to that https domain. OpenAI requires https for the websocket connection
