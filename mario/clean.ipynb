      "All right, so we wanted to answer the question once and for all: What is the best smartphone camera out right now? Maybe you think it’s the iPhone, or maybe it's a Samsung flagship, or perhaps it’s one of those Pixels. \n",
      "\n",
      "In years past, we’ve conducted blind voting using social media polls, which was really fun and yielded some surprising results. However, the results still depended on the match-ups I set up at the very beginning. I specifically placed the iPhone and the Pixel on opposite sides of the bracket, expecting the best ones to hopefully meet in the finals, but they never did. Plus, there was always a bit of human input involved; it’s possible I could have accidentally placed the second best phone against the best phone in the first round and had it eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this time, we’re going to solve that once and for all. Welcome to the \"Blind Smartphone Camera Test: Scientific Edition.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the idea: We took 16 smartphones that came out this year. These are the flagship models—the expected heavy hitters—but we also included some mid-range options and even a few surprises. Then, we took the exact same photo with each one of them. This was harder than it sounds because you have to hold perfectly still for several minutes straight. But we did this for three different types of photos: a standard daylight photo, a low-light photo, and a portrait mode snap. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we took all these images, compressed them, stripped them of their EXIF data, and assigned each one a letter. For maximum statistical confidence, we would ideally ask you all to vote on every possible matchup at least once—A versus B, then A versus C, then A versus D, and so forth. But that’s clearly a bit much; we want to be scientific, but asking you to vote over 100 times for each category was too tall an order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, we got a little clever with it and built a power ranking system—specifically, an ELO rating algorithm, which you might have heard of before. They use this in chess, table tennis, and essentially in any video game where match-ups are encountered, and a ranking needs to be formed. This time, we used it to create a power ranking for smartphone cameras. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, when you complete enough sanctioned match-ups, you receive a rating based on the ratings of your match-ups. You, along with everyone else, see comparisons at random, and we have a little progress bar along the bottom. You vote for the better photo each time, and after a while, we have enough information to determine your individual, customized, statistically significant winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "We built this entire site with the ELO rating system in place, loaded all the photos, and then tossed it into our Discord to have some of you beta test it before anyone else knew it existed. Shout out to Discord for sponsoring this portion of today’s video. With the launch of their new Server Subscription feature, we opened an exclusive premium area on our Discord server where members can ask the team, including me, general questions about tech or any of the content. You can also get exclusive insider info that you won’t find anywhere else, like this test. If you’re a creator looking for more information on this particular feature, definitely check out the link below.\n",
      "\n",
      "So anyway, I dropped the site link in there, and many of you got in quickly and voted. We received the data back in a text format. It looked a bit messy at first, but it was actually quite helpful and manageable. It summarized how many times each matchup was voted on and the votes for each side. Since I had a lot of assistance in building this site and loading the pictures, I didn’t know which phones were involved, allowing me to blind test myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was every bit as engaging as I expected. While I could tell some of the phones that I suspected took certain pictures, for the most part, I simply glanced at the two side-by-side photos, and if I was seeing them on Instagram or Twitter, I just picked the better one without doing any pixel peeping or thorough inspection. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of my testing, I found that my standard picture winner was G, my low-light winner was K, and my portrait mode winner was also K. Everything seemed to be working, and the data processing was on point. The only thing left to do was send it live, and here we go. \n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as it went public, you guys jumped right on it. We peaked at around 35,000 votes per minute, totaling more than 21 million votes in about three days. There were essentially zero bad actors, and now we have a wealth of data. Many of you may have participated in this, meaning you’ve cast your votes and now have your letter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now it’s time to reveal all the smartphones involved in this test. Here you go from A through P. That’s all 16 phones listed. Therefore, the winner of the standard photo when I blind-tested myself was the Pixel 6A, while the winner for portrait mode and night mode was the Pixel 7. \n",
      "\n",
      "But what were the overall winners according to statistics, over the 20-plus million votes? I don’t know if there’s any other collection of data like this anywhere on the internet, so this is super cool to explore. \n",
      "\n",
      "So let’s dig into it. First of all, the overall winner—with the highest average ELO rating across all three categories—was the Pixel 6A, declared the people’s choice camera of 2022. In third place is the Asus Zenfone 9, and in second place is the Pixel 7 Pro. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, there’s a lot of fascinating information to unpack. Performing well in one category did not guarantee success in the others. For example, the Pixel 7 Pro placed second, fourth, and first across the three categories, while the Pixel 6A came in third, second, and second. Meanwhile, the Oppo Find X5 Pro took first in standard mode, third in low light, and fifteenth in portrait mode. \n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests that you could argue for the importance of the standard photo over low-light or portrait mode photos. If we assume the standard photo is approximately three times as important to most people, then the Oppo Find X5 Pro could be considered the overall winner, which is interesting. \n",
      "\n",
      "In case you’re curious about the iPhone’s performance, the iPhone 14 Pro ranked sixth, tenth, and fifth across the categories. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s take a look at the biggest losers—the phones that performed the worst in this test. The top contenders for “biggest losers” are the Sony Xperia 1 IV and the Moto Edge 30 Ultra. These phones had poor results overall. The Sony, despite its world-class sensor and advanced apps, went into full auto mode, like the rest of the phones, and failed to produce good pictures, ending up with the lowest average ELO rating across all three categories. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the Moto Edge 30 Ultra recorded the most overall losses. It produced some very unusual photos, including an extremely dark standard photo and an extraordinarily over-sharpened low-light picture, becoming the only phone to receive 2 million total votes against it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here’s an interesting thought: votes per dollar. If we sort by value for money, which phones performed the best relative to their launch price? The winners in this category are the Pixel 6A—no surprise here, with over 4,200 votes per dollar—and the Realme 10 Pro+, which is also impressive, being the only other phone over 4,000 votes per dollar at a price of $379. \n",
      "\n",
      "The significant losers in this regard are again the $900 Moto Edge and the $1,600 Sony Xperia 1 IV. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also had to dive into the text files to find the biggest discrepancy in match-ups between two phones in any category. The most significant difference was in portrait mode, where the Pixel 7 Pro faced off against the Sony Xperia 1 IV, with the Pixel winning 98% of the votes. To the 1,523 of you who voted for the Sony here, I’m not sure what you saw that the rest of us didn’t. \n",
      "\n",
      "While it’s enlightening to see which phones received the most votes, it’s equally interesting to discover why certain phones and photos garnered more votes. The best way to do that was to categorize and order all the photos by the number of votes they received. This process revealed some intriguing patterns. For example, during our previous match-ups, we established that in cases of A versus B, if one photo appears significantly brighter than the other, it’s likely to win. But how far can brightness go? Is there such a thing as “too bright”? \n",
      "\n",
      "It turns out, yes. The standard mode photos arranged from highest to lowest votes showed us that the three darkest photos were, without exception, the biggest losers. They lost substantial shadow detail in my hair and the comfortable sweater I’m wearing from shop.mkbhd.com. However, right above those were the three most overexposed photos, indicating a consistent order: great photos, then too bright, then too dark. This suggests that good exposure generally prevails, and if there is a misjudgment, people would prefer a photo that’s too bright rather than too dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "When reviewing low-light photos, you can see a similar pattern. Most neutral and correctly exposed photos, when sharp, generally won. The Vivo X80 Pro, Pixel 6A, Oppo Find X5 Pro, and Pixel 7 Pro all had strong performances. Then came two bright photos, which were preferred over the two dark ones. We also observed some wild anomalies in these low-light photos—the Vivo clearly stood out as the low-light champion. The S22 Ultra interestingly came in fifth despite completely missing focus on my face and instead focusing on the background. The iPhone 14 Pro, despite its excessive HDR processing that yielded a somewhat green \"zombie-like\" appearance, managed to grab 11th place. \n",
      "\n",
      "As noted earlier, the Moto Edge Plus produced perhaps the most over-sharpened photo ever recorded, and in last place was the iPhone SE, the only phone without a night mode. It's unfortunate because it has OIS, a decent sensor, and a new processor; Apple simply held back premium features to protect higher-end models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, in portrait mode, the most variety emerged. In addition to factors such as sharpness and color exposure, we also judged cutout quality and the appearance of artificially blurred backgrounds. Each phone used slightly different focal lengths for their portrait mode by default; some used a 2x, others 2.5, some 3x, and even a couple used 1x. Ultimately, the Pixel 7 Pro dominated portrait mode as the clear winner, with great cutout quality, exposure, colors, and a nice soft background. The Pixel 6A came in second, while the Realme 10 Pro+ ranked third.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above them was what I believe to be the best cutout of the competition, from the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which seems nearly perfect in edge detection. This allowed it to rank fourth instead of seventh. I was curious whether there would be a correlation between the number of votes a phone received and whether a telephoto focal length was used, as this might yield a more natural blurred background at 3x. However, when we lined everything up, there was almost no correlation, which was interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, the three worst photos that received the fewest votes were also the brightest ones, confirming that you can, in fact, overdo brightness. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, in summary, the lessons learned from all the data are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Excelling in one category doesn’t guarantee success in the others.\n",
      "2. The Pixel 6A and the Realme 10 Pro+ are the best value options for smartphone cameras from the phones launched in 2022.\n",
      "3. The Pixel 6A being the overall winner aligns with its success in our previous bracket-style social media polling blind test, which was won by the Pixel 5A.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, brighter photos generally win, but it is indeed possible to go too bright. This mission was a success, and I’d like to congratulate the Pixel 6A as the People’s Choice Award winner! \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll keep the voting website up until the end of January, so you can still blind test yourself until January 31st at vote.mkbhd.com. I think we can now replace the letters with the actual names of the phones now that they’ve been revealed. However, we don’t want to bear the cost of processing all this data forever, so that’s your deadline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to everyone on Discord who helped beta test this project, to Zach for assisting in building the site and implementing the ELO-style power ranking system, and thanks to you for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace! \n",

      "A couple of days ago, I posted a Twitter thread—yes, I still call it Twitter—and I severely underestimated how many of you would find it interesting. The conversation it sparked was really engaging, and the discussions afterward were fun to participate in. So, I decided to share even more footage from my visit to Apple's secret iPhone durability testing labs.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve ever wondered how an iPhone undergoes water resistance testing, drop testing, or rigorous shaking before it gets announced on stage, these are the labs where that all happens. It’s fascinating how they connect the dots between test results and smartphone construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing I experienced was the water resistance testing. Most of us take for granted that high-end smartphones, especially flagship models, typically have IP68 ratings. However, many don’t realize that IP is a code, where \"IP\" stands for ingress protection. The first number relates to solids, and the second to liquids. Each of these numbers increases as protection against ingress improves. For instance, earbuds or headphones may have an IPX4 rating, which means they aren’t dust-proof but can withstand light splashes from any direction—great for sweat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first iPhones, up to the iPhone 6s, weren’t rated for water resistance. The first water-resistant iPhone was the iPhone 7, which had an IP67 rating. Now, we see everything rated at IP68, meaning it can be submerged underwater for an extended period. This is what the testing looks like: there is specialized equipment to torture phones with water to ensure they can survive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many companies have similar setups, but it was cool to witness it firsthand. The lowest level of the test simulates rain and splashing with a drip ceiling, requiring no real water pressure, passing for IPX4. To simulate water pressure, jets rotate around the device and spray it from all angles, including the speakers, earpiece, and ports. Passing this test earns an IPX5 rating. \n",
      "\n",
      "To ramp it up, they place the phone on one end and blast it with high-pressure water from a literal fire hose on the other end. It looks insane! Yet, if we want our modern smartphones to endure splashes at various angles multiple times over their lifespan, they must pass this test to achieve the IPX6 rating. Finally, for IPX7 and IPX8, which involve full submersion, they use lockable sealed tanks. IPX8 requires the device to withstand deep water for an extended time. They even have a pressurized tank to simulate different water depths, leaving phones submerged for as long as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, if you drop your phone in a toilet, spill water on it, or drop it in a lake, it should survive. We often take this for granted, but the seals, gaskets, and adhesives required for these tests are what allow them to perform in real-world scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a whole separate type of testing you might have already seen on YouTube—drop testing. Apple has been conducting its own internal drop testing for years. In the same building, they set up an industrial robot by Epson programmed to perform drop tests in front of ultra-bright lights and super high-speed Phantom cameras focused on the exact spot where the phone will land. \n",
      "\n",
      "The robot can pick up the phone and drop it onto any surface repeatedly. They can also vary the surfaces for A/B testing to analyze the results. For those of you into cameras, you’ll know these Phantom cameras can shoot at impressive frame rates. I didn’t catch the exact rate during my visit, but it was fascinating to see the titanium on the iPhone 15 Pro wobble on its first and second impacts with the ground. \n",
      "\n",
      "They tested all kinds of surfaces—from granite countertops to marble to wood. They even had a massive block of asphalt to see how the iPhone fares when dropped on the street. This was an impressive setup. However, it raises the question: how much of this data translates into real changes in phone design? Most phones still break upon impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenging test to capture was the shaking tests. Apple has machines designed with trays of devices strapped to a surface shaken thousands of times at specific frequencies. Recording this is tricky because if the shutter speed is just right, it looks like nothing is moving—similar to how car wheels appear stationary on camera. However, I managed to capture some clips where you can see the shaking in action.\n",
      "\n",
      "These machines simulate years of wear and tear in the real world. Apple can program in the frequency of various engines or vibrations (like those from a motorcycle, car, or subway) to ensure durability over extended exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most fascinating part of this testing process is that Apple aims to simulate years of wear and tear before the phone even hits the market, using specialized machines designed for this purpose. I spoke with John Ternus, head of hardware engineering at Apple, who mentioned they sometimes go through around 10,000 iPhone prototypes to finalize a design after all this durability testing. That sounds incredible! \n",
      "\n",
      "I took this unique opportunity to ask John about the dual concepts of durability and repairability. Apple has a reputation for being not great at repairability—the iPhone is notoriously difficult to fix. Yet, the more I think about it, durability seems to be at odds with repairability. It feels like there’s a sliding scale between the two: as you increase durability, the repairability decreases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a snippet of our conversation on this topic:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Sometimes, for me, I find it helpful to think about the bookends. Imagine a product that never fails, at one end, and at the other, a product that's super easy to repair but not very reliable.\"  \n",
      "- \"Right.\"  \n",
      "- \"A product that never fails is better for the customer and the environment.\"  \n",
      "- \"Interesting to view it that way. On one end, you have the product that never fails, and on the other, a product that can be infinitely repaired but isn't reliable.\"  \n",
      "- \"Sure, but they aren't always mutually exclusive. Those represent the extremes. For example, take the battery on an iPhone. A battery needs to be replaced over time to extend the product's life.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the early days, the primary failure type was water ingress from dropping the phone in water or spilling a drink on it. They've made significant strides to minimize such failures, achieving an impressive IP68 rating. Customers often share stories about dropping their phones in lakes and having them still work.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, to achieve this impressive reliability, a lot of seals, adhesives, and materials must be designed, complicating battery repairs. They do have solutions for customers who need battery replacements, but ultimately, greater reliability benefits consumers and the environment by reducing failure rates and repair needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s intriguing to hear Apple speak directly on this. Ideally, if Apple aims to create the ultimate phone that never breaks, they probably shouldn't use glass because, as JerryRigEverything says, \"glass is glass\" and breaks. Still, they aim to push towards that ideal. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s my behind-the-scenes look at Apple’s durability testing labs that we’ve never seen before. Make sure to subscribe for more exciting content like this, and let me know your thoughts on the trade-off between durability and repairability. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. \n",

      "- All right, Tim.\n",
      "- Great to see you.\n",
      "- Thanks for spending the time.\n",
      "- Thank you for coming. So, you had the WWDC keynote today.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- Which was really fun to watch. It was a whole two hours. I want to zoom all the way out because, obviously, there was a lot of talk about AI in general.\n",
      "- [Tim] Yeah.\n",
      "- I'm kind of left wondering how Apple defines AI overall, because I know if you ask a regular person, you might hear about generative AI, chatbots, things like that.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- These are relatively new additions to Apple's AI portfolio. How do you look at AI as Apple?\n",
      "- Well, we’ve been executing with AI for a long time.\n",
      "- [Marques] Right.\n",
      "- It’s at the root of the watch you’re wearing. If you think about things like crash detection, fall detection, and Afib, all of this is machine learning at the end of the day. But what has captured people’s imagination is generative AI. We see it as the opportunity for a whole new wave of technology that provides more assistance to people and improves their lives. So, that’s how we see it. Obviously, it’s not without downsides, which is why we approach it very thoughtfully.\n",
      "- Sure.\n",
      "- As you heard, we have always been focused on privacy, and privacy is a very key tenet of our approach to AI.\n",
      "- Right. It’s been interesting to watch Apple’s arc with AI because I created a piece less than a year ago about how Apple seemed to never say \"AI,\" even though they have all these neural engines and machine learning capabilities.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- Now we see a pivot where we’re actively branding it as Apple Intelligence. I’m curious why that change happened.\n",
      "- Well, in the beginning, and pretty much throughout everything we do, we always talk about the benefits to the user. The benefits are things like crash detection and fall detection, not the technology behind those features.\n",
      "- Sure.\n",
      "- We still view it that way, but it became clear that people wanted to know our perspective on generative AI in particular.\n",
      "- [Marques] Yeah.\n",
      "- So we decided to embrace it and brand it as Apple Intelligence.\n",
      "- Okay. I have a quote from the Dua Lipa interview that you did.\n",
      "- [Tim] Oh, okay.\n",
      "- [Marques] That was great.\n",
      "- [Tim] It was fun. She’s fantastic.\n",
      "- I loved it. You had a quote about AI: \"If it can be used for nefarious things, we won’t go down that road.\"\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- At the time, I assumed that meant generative AI was off the table because of concerns about its potential misuse. Has that changed? Is that something that was initially off the table, or do you now feel you have the right tools or restrictions in place?\n",
      "- Generative AI was never off the table. It was always about pursuing it in a thoughtful way. That’s what we’ve done, and we’ve implemented it in ways that are less likely to create issues.\n",
      "- How so?\n",
      "- Well, we talked about personal context and privacy. We’re not waiting for comprehensive privacy legislation to come into effect; we already view privacy as a fundamental human right. That’s the lens we use, and given those principles, we wanted to deeply integrate this into the apps you’re already using.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "- So, you’re not having to think, \"Oh, well, now I want to do something that uses AI.\" We’re embedding it deeply.\n",
      "- Right. Now there’s a lot of talk about generative AI.\n",
      "- [Tim] Yeah.\n",
      "- Apple is notorious for keeping everything on-device because that’s the most secure way, and that’s been applauded. However, now, with larger models and more complex requests, you actually have to go off the device. You’ve developed something called Private Cloud Compute.\n",
      "- Private Cloud Compute.\n",
      "- Explain this, because a lot of people think they have to send data to OpenAI, for example, to make a request to ChatGPT.\n",
      "- Well, Private Cloud Compute is different from our arrangement with OpenAI.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- If you look at Private Cloud Compute, we’re utilizing a similar architecture to the silicon in the iPhone.\n",
      "- [Marques] Right.\n",
      "- We’ve designed it so it’s as safe, secure, and private in the Private Cloud Compute environment as it is on the device. We’ve worked hard on this to ensure that. If you're working on something that requires world knowledge—beyond personal context—then you may want to use one of the large language models available on the market. We selected what we feel is the best option with OpenAI and ChatGPT, but you’ll make that decision consciously every time.\n",
      "- Every time.\n",
      "- So you can guarantee that there will never be any data sent to OpenAI without your explicit consent.\n",
      "- That’s right. You decide.\n",
      "- I also found it interesting that there was a brief interest in standalone AI devices, which didn't land too well. I think smartphones are pretty great, but you mentioned using AI to help reduce time spent on screens. This is something you echoed in the Dua Lipa interview—if you’re looking at your phone more than you’re looking at someone else’s eyes, something’s off.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- Do you think there’s potential in the future for people to use their phones less because of how effective the Intelligence becomes?\n",
      "- I think that’s a significant possibility. We’ve never been motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices. Our model doesn’t depend on engagement to succeed; it’s about empowering you to do things you couldn’t do otherwise. We want to provide tools for incredible possibilities.\n",
      "- That’s the motivation behind initiatives like Screen Time, which makes users aware of their device usage.\n",
      "- True.\n",
      "- We count notifications so you can evaluate if you really need that many, and we have focus modes to help manage distraction. I believe as Apple Intelligence gets smarter, tasks that once took time will take less time.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "- I believe that opportunity exists.\n",
      "- Interesting. It's a curious future.\n",
      "- It is, and I’m really optimistic about it.\n",
      "- Yeah. I also feel like there was a lot of chatter when you first became CEO about the shift from Steve Jobs, and now you’ve been CEO for quite some time. We’re entering a new age of AI, and there’s talk about who the next CEO will be. What do you think your legacy as CEO at Apple should be?\n",
      "- Yeah, Marques, I don’t really think about it.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- To me, a legacy is defined by how others see you, not something you define yourself.\n",
      "- Very fair.\n",
      "- I’m typically focused on the future, not the past. That characteristic defines Apple as well; we don’t have a museum here, even though we could have plenty of nostalgic items on display. It’s just not part of our culture.\n",
      "- [Marques] Yeah.\n",
      "- Personally, it’s the same; at some point, there will be another CEO, and my focus will be on making them successful.\n",
      "- Yeah. I like that answer. It’s very reminiscent of LeBron when he spoke about legacy.\n",
      "- Oh, is that right?\n",
      "- Yeah. All right, I want to end with a little game. Have you seen these blind rankings?\n",
      "- A blind ranking?\n",
      "- A blind ranking. We’re going to rank the top five Apple products of all time, but I’ll give you them one at a time, and you won't know the rest.\n",
      "- Oh.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- This will be your unofficial ranking based on your gut reaction.\n",
      "- This is tough because...\n",
      "- It is tough.\n",
      "- It’s like picking your favorite among kids or nieces and nephews.\n",
      "- We’ll see how it goes.\n",
      "- Okay, number one: MacBook Air. It had that iconic moment of being taken out of the envelope on stage. It’s the most popular laptop in the world, right?\n",
      "- It is. That moment of taking it out of the folder established a characteristic about that device that lives on today. Initially, it wasn’t about how many people would buy it.\n",
      "- [Marques] Yeah.\n",
      "- It was about establishing a foundation.\n",
      "- Was that the first Air product?\n",
      "- I believe so.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- I think that was indeed the first.\n",
      "- Okay. Next: the iPad.\n",
      "- Oh, wow. Tablets had been around for a while. Our goal is never to be first; it’s to be the best.\n",
      "- I remember all the rumors leading up to it.\n",
      "- There were many rumors, and people had mixed feelings about it initially, including the name. Yet, I personally can’t live without my iPad today.\n",
      "- [Marques] Yeah.\n",
      "- Another huge moment for the company.\n",
      "- My number three is the Magic Mouse.\n",
      "- The Magic Mouse was also a significant moment. People might overlook it compared to the MacBook Air and the iPad, but executing the ergonomics well was key.\n",
      "- With the Magic Mouse.\n",
      "- [Tim] Yes.\n",
      "- Okay, number four: the iPhone.\n",
      "- Oh my God. It changed the world.\n",
      "- It definitely changed the world.\n",
      "- The simplicity of defining the three core elements of the phone was brilliant. Initially, I’ll remind everyone, there wasn’t an App Store.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "- The App Store launched a year later and transformed the developer community. Now, I meet with students during WWDC who inspire me greatly. At that time, there were no students in the developer community. It’s now diverse in age, and it became an economic miracle for many, moving beyond just hobbyist projects.\n",
      "- Yeah, and now we have WWDC.\n",
      "- That’s right.\n",
      "- Last but not least: Vision Pro.\n",
      "- Oh.\n",
      "- I love Vision Pro. I was just using it last night to watch a screening.\n",
      "- Yeah. What do you use Vision Pro for? I ask everyone who has one what they use it for.\n",
      "- I primarily use it for entertainment value. It’s excellent for multitasking; the multiple windows are very effective. I'm also reviewing various apps, both enterprise and proprietary, and there’s an extraordinary variety coming from the enterprise sector sooner than we predicted.\n",
      "- Interesting.\n",
      "- Businesses typically move slowly to adopt new technologies.\n",
      "- [Marques] Yeah.\n",
      "- However, we’re seeing that half of the Fortune 100 is now exploring Vision Pro for various projects.\n",
      "- [Marques] Interesting.\n",
      "- I find it still to be an emotional experience to look at photos, and with visionOS 2, being able to make old photos 3D is significant.\n",
      "- [Marques] Yeah.\n",
      "- I lost both my parents before Vision Pro launched, and revisiting those photos differently is a unique experience you can’t replicate.\n",
      "- For sure. Well, we didn’t get a blind ranking, but we got a solid retrospective of some of these products.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- Thank you again for your time.\n",
      "- Thank you.\n",
      "- I’m looking forward to when the next feature drops at the upcoming WWDC, but this was fun. Thank you.\n",
      "- Yeah, it was great fun. Thank you for coming.\n",

      "Hey guys, Google had an event today where they completely surprised us by announcing the totally unexpected Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, along with the Pixel Watch that somehow never leaked. It completely caught us off guard. I hope you can sense my sarcasm through the internet, but hey, I dig an event, and it has some stuff that I was really looking forward to—mostly the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro—because I've been a Pixel fan. Even though I know it has big flaws, like the Tensor G2's subpar performance and somewhat average battery life, I still like the Pixel, and there's a lot I was looking forward to in the next iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "They delivered on a lot of that but it also comes with a new price. So, on the outside, the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro still look like Pixels, right? I told you they were sticking with this design language with the visor because it’s very recognizable, and they've finally got that going for them. This year, though, it feels like they rounded everything off—that's the big visible design update; everything's a bit more rounded. And then there are the new colors. Honestly, I think it’s been a pretty boring year for phone colors across the board, just putting it out there. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the Pixel 8, there's Hazel, Rose, and Obsidian, and for the Pixel 8 Pro, there's Obsidian, Porcelain, and a new blue color called Bay. I think the blue is probably the most interesting of the whole lineup, especially with the new matte finish on the back of all the Pros. I love that; it might be my favorite alongside Matte Black—maybe it’s a toss-up between the two. \n",
      "\n",
      "Around the front, both displays have actually improved. The bezels are a bit thinner and look pretty uniform all the way around. They’re also dramatically brighter—up to 2,000 nits peak brightness on the Pixel 8 and 2,400 nits on the 8 Pro. I think that’s the highest brightness I’ve ever seen in a phone, so it should look really good both indoors and outdoors. Plus, the smaller Pixel 8 is now at 120 Hz as well. I love that. I know people love to dismiss 120 Hz on cheaper phones, but we’re there now. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not LTPO yet; that’s still just for the Pro. But yeah, just looking at these screens for the limited time I spent with them, I’m very excited to see how they perform in the real world. They’re calling it an \"Actua Display\" and a \"Super Actua Display.\" Not sure why, but I guess you have to name everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, this year, the really big physical change we’re getting with these phones is the new Tensor G3 chip. It’s the third generation of Google Silicon, paired with eight gigs of RAM on the Pixel 8 and 12 gigs of RAM on the Pixel 8 Pro. To be honest, Google didn’t really talk much about raw performance improvements, like CPU and GPU; it’s not really about that. I’ll have to test these phones to see if they actually improve a lot in overall power. Definitely get subscribed to be the first to see those reviews when they come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new batteries in these phones are slightly bigger than last year. But really, the story with the Tensor G3 is that there’s way more TPU and processing power for AI-related tasks. That checks out because the Pixel story has always been about the software, and that’s still very true with these. The Pixel is basically the smartest smartphone in the room. It’s not going to wow you with amazing numbers or incredible build quality; it’s going to impress you with clever software at every corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we’re talking about a new Google Assistant feature where, if you’re on a webpage in Chrome, you can ask the Assistant to summarize the webpage for you. Using the same tech from Google Bard, it’ll quickly provide you with a three or four bullet-point summary, hopefully accurate. Speech-to-text is also now even faster and more accurate. It’s completely on-device and does a much better job at recognizing that \"ums\" and \"uhs\" are not part of your actual sentence, so it doesn’t write them down—that’s smart.\n",
      "\n",
      "They’re also doing more with the front-facing camera to make features like face unlock and unlocking apps more secure. There’s even a new fix-it feature that proofreads your messages built into the keyboard before you send them, checking for things like grammar and more. One of the standout features is the new call screen voice. If you’ve used a Pixel before, you know about call screening; when you get a call from an unknown number, you let the Google Assistant screen it. The new one has a much more human voice that sounds either like a very advanced robot or a recording of an actual person. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s much more human-sounding, and it has context-aware responses now. For example, if it listens to someone say, \"Hey, I’m a UPS driver,\" you can hit a button that automatically responds, \"Oh, you can leave the package at the doorstep.\" I recorded this so you can hear it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Google Assistant] Hi, I’m a Google Virtual Calling Assistant recording this call on behalf of the person you’re trying to reach. Can you say what you’re calling about?\n",
      "- [Courier] I’m trying to drop off a package for Kenny.\n",
      "(no audio)\n",
      "- [Google Assistant] They said you can go ahead and leave the package by the front door.\n",
      "(no audio)\n",
      "- [Courier] Okay, thanks. That’s great.\n",
      "(no audio)\n",
      "- [Google Assistant] Great, I’ll see you soon.\n",
      "(beeps)\n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, that sounds pretty good to me. It sounds very human, but again, I don’t know; it could just literally be a human recording. Either way, it’s a virtual assistant. But what would a Pixel be without some camera magic? Let’s jump into the new camera features with the Pixel because there's a lot of software magic going on here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro now share the same upgraded 50-megapixel main camera system. The 8 also has a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, but the 8 Pro takes it up a notch with a 48-megapixel ultra-wide and a 48-megapixel 5x telephoto lens. I also really like the new camera app layout, which is now basically separated into photo and video modes, with various settings and modes housed inside each. I think it makes intuitive sense—you can switch to photo mode and then choose a specific photo mode. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are manual controls, too. It’s not the first time I’ve seen it laid out this way, but when you have so much happening in the camera, you don’t want to hide or move features; you just need to organize them effectively. I think this layout does a good job. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll have to save my photo and video quality analysis for the full review, but there are lots of new software features that seem to push the boundaries. One standout is the Magic Editor. You’ve probably seen the Magic Eraser, which can erase people from the background of photos, but now Magic Editor lets you select subjects and move them around, altering the entire photo with just a few taps. They showed me an example of moving a subject in a beach photo, but there are other demos of changing the sky, shadows, and more. Honestly, it seems nothing is off-limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also a feature I didn’t get footage of called Best Take. It’s for taking a group photo—you know how you always have someone blinking in the picture? Google detects that you’re taking a burst photo and lets you tap on the people’s faces to swap them with different instances from other photos, creating a composite image where everyone looks perfect, even though that moment never happened. What is a photo, right? (laughs)\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there’s another feature called Audio Eraser, a video editing tool exclusive to the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro but usable on any video in your library. It erases background sounds from videos featuring a subject, and it supposedly works really well. The demo they showed me worked incredibly well. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of this is along the theme of awesome software magic enabled by the Tensor G3. The neural cores and processing powers are what make all this fancy software possible. There are also two other features that didn’t fit into the rest of this video. One is a new hole on the back of the Pro phone, which is a temperature sensor. Yes, really. \n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a new thermometer app that asks you to select a material to measure the surface temperature for accuracy. You pick your material, get close, and tap to measure. It works, and it's pretty neat. I don’t know how often I'd use this, but you may notice that humans are absent from the object selection menu, as measuring human temperature is still awaiting FDA approval. Maybe that’ll be added once it gets approved later this year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the haptics are amazing! I noticed this right away when typing on the 8 Pro; the haptics are much stronger and more refined. There's a difference between just strong haptics and clean, refined haptics, and this has both. I think that’s super underrated. I don’t know if they’ll mention this in marketing materials, but I loved the haptics during my time with this phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Quick interjection: One more thing I wanted to mention is called Video Boost. It's one of the weirdest features; it's only available on the Pro Pixel and doesn’t launch with the phone—it’ll come later. The idea is that you take a video on your Pixel, and it looks okay at first. Then you upload it to the cloud, where it processes overnight or after a few hours and returns a dramatically better version—better HDR, improved color grading, making the video look much better than the original. I’m not sure why it’s limited to the Pro phone or why it uploads to servers, but it’s just this weird video magic feature called Video Boost. We’ll see what happens when it rolls out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the new prices: the Pixel 8 is starting at $699, which is $100 more than last year, and the Pixel 8 Pro will start at $999. I think you can justify it, though. The base Pixel just got upgraded to a 120 Hz display with a much brighter screen and thinner bezels, and it features the Tensor G3 along with a primary camera similar to that in the more expensive model. I still feel like that’s a fair price, even if it’s not the bargain of the year like before. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another great update for both devices is they’re offering seven years of OS security and feature updates. Seven years! It’s impressive and something they probably should have been doing from the start with Google’s own phone running Google’s software. Just think about that—this phone will get its last software update in 2030. Good job, Google! \n",
      "\n",
      "They also announced an update to the Pixel Watch 2. It maintains the same sleek pebble design, but now it has a new quad-core processor for significant speed improvements and potentially longer battery life. They’re promising 24 hours with the always-on display. There are newly redesigned apps like Gmail and Calendar. \n",
      "\n",
      "They’ve added several features that resemble those recently announced for the Apple Watch. There’s a new safety check feature that works almost exactly like Apple’s. They’ve also added a skin temperature sensor for monitoring patterns, along with auto workout start and stop detection, and backup and restore features that should have been available ages ago but now have been added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the back of the Watch, there are improved sensors for better heart rate and health data monitoring during vigorous activity. This watch will launch at the same price as last year—$349 for the Wi-Fi only model and $399 for the LTE version. \n",
      "\n",
      "And that brings us to the sponsor of this video, the Dbrand Ghost Case. They’re making one for the new Pixels—the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro—allowing you to showcase that matte finish or new color through the case while keeping it protected. Even though it doesn't have G2 wireless charging like it was rumored to, that hasn’t stopped Dbrand from adding a MagSafe compatible ring on the back. I also like the unique question mark design compared to the classic Apple MagSafe layout. Dbrand claims the Ghost Case will never turn yellow, unlike other clear cases. If you want to pick up a Ghost Case, I’ll leave a link below.\n",

      "That’s it for now. Let me know what you guys want to see in the reviews of these devices—the phones and the watch—because my name is Marques Brownlee, and it is officially Techtober.

      "You know, if you've been watching my videos, you've noticed a certain phrase I've been using for years: small flagship phones are a rare breed. I've repeated this countless times over the years, but sadly, today, that's no longer true. That breed is now extinct. Rest in peace to the small flagship phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't even need to look too far back to recall when phones were generally smaller. But quickly, we moved to four-inch screens, then five-inch screens took off, and soon six-inch flagships were everywhere. While we never quite reached seven-inch phones becoming mainstream, all the biggest flagships now flirt with that size.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amusing part is that smartphone manufacturers frequently come to the same realization: smartphone screens are getting bigger, leaving room for smaller alternatives to fit beneath that trend. For instance, I recently reviewed every single Samsung Galaxy S ever. When they first started to grow bigger, they also introduced a Galaxy S Mini. It was a quintessential Samsung move. But guess what? That version is now dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same happened with Apple. They released large iPhones, and for two years, we had the iPhone Mini. But that’s now discontinued as well. This cycle continued until there was basically only one decent small flagship phone left: the Asus Zenfone, the last of its kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Released in 2022, the Zenfone 9 was almost a perfect flagship phone. It boasted flagship specs, remarkable performance, incredible battery life, and solid cameras. It won my small phone of the year award by a landslide, even with a few minor flaws, like a less durable back material and the absence of wireless charging.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2023, they launched a sequel, the Zenfone 10, which took a great concept and improved upon it. They addressed the back material issue, added wireless charging, and upgraded to the latest flagship chips without losing any features. It was simply an excellent flagship phone with a screen under six inches in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it’s 2024, and the new Zenfone is a massive 6.8-inch ultra phone. Honestly, we probably should have seen this coming. Small flagships rarely last more than a year or two. However, it does hit harder because this was the last small option available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider this: Apple is arguably one of the best supply chain companies in the world; that's how they've built their business. Tim Cook transformed their stock price significantly, primarily due to their supply chain management. When they launch a new line of products, they have to analyze and determine exactly how many units to produce. This involves complex studies and estimates for each SKU. They aim for just the right amount in inventory. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2020, for the first time, Apple released a lineup of four new iPhones: the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, and the iPhone 12 Mini. The 12 and 12 Pro were the same size, representing a nice balance in the lineup, while the 12 Pro Max was the largest model with the biggest screen and price. The most pocketable iPhone, however, was the Mini. Tim Cook and the supply chain experts at Apple already knew that small phones generally don’t sell well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this understanding and the necessary production adjustments, the reviews for the Mini were overwhelmingly positive. People loved the smaller phone, even if the battery life wasn’t as robust. It offered a flagship design, chip, and camera in a compact form, which was rare. Tech reviewers praised it, and users enjoyed it too. However, the iPhone 12 Mini sold dramatically less than Apple expected, sometimes accounting for only about 5% of total sales. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Mini quickly went from being the beloved option to the least successful iPhone launch ever. The media speculated whether Apple would try this again. They did release the iPhone 13 Mini, but it performed even worse and was eventually discontinued, with a new Plus-sized iPhone replacing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The takeaway from the iPhone Mini experiment is that not enough people buy small phones to justify continued production, even for a company as large as Apple. Positive reviews don’t necessarily indicate success, nor do negative reviews always lead to a product's demise.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now we have the Zenfone. Not to diminish the Zenfone 11 Ultra, which is a perfectly good large flagship phone. It carries all the strengths of the Zenfone 10 to a larger scale, like a bigger battery, impressive battery life, the latest specs, and solid performance. It even added a third telephoto camera. However, it lacks the one distinguishing feature—the small size that made it unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new Zenfone just blends in with the sea of other large phones. I suspect that even though the Zenfone 9 and 10 were celebrated, they didn’t sell well, much like the iPhone 12 Mini and 13 Mini. Interestingly, the most popular new iPhones remain the Pro and Pro Max models, the high-end options.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Asus responded by creating a high-end large phone. To be clear, Asus hasn’t officially stated that they won't produce a regular Zenfone 11, but their current actions suggest this could be the only model. They might have simply rebranded it, much like Apple moved from Mini to Plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "This trend reflects the enthusiast phone dilemma. When a manufacturer creates an enthusiast phone, it garners a passionate following. However, as they attempt to expand and make the product more popular, they often lose their core fans. I don’t know if this new Zenfone will lose its dedicated followers, but those who appreciated the small design will likely feel alienated.\n",
      "\n",
      "This trend is also seen in budget phones. Small budget phones are becoming larger too; for instance, the Pixel 7A measures 6.1 inches, and the recently released Nothing Phone 2 is considered oversized. There are even rumors that the next iPhone SE won’t be small.\n",
      "\n",
      "The void left by the absence of small flagship phones remains. Someone might come along and briefly fill that gap, but don’t expect it to last long. Rest in peace, small flagship phone.\n",

      "So I've made a few references over the past couple of years to that time the FBI visited the studio, and I was asked not to talk about it for what I feel are pretty obvious reasons. For years I haven't mentioned it, but it turns out I'm now finally able to tell that story. So here we are.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those of you who don't know, we have a studio here in a larger building with multiple tenants. It’s not exactly an office building, but there is a front desk and security. I’ve been in this building long enough that we have a good relationship with them. We have one rule: if anyone shows up at the front desk asking for me, the security guy there, whom we’ll call Bob, doesn’t let them in. I have to come out and meet them to confirm that I’m expecting them, and then I bring them back to our studio. If someone randomly shows up and I don’t show up to meet them, then I wasn’t supposed to meet them. \n",
      "\n",
      "In June 2020, it was early in this new space we had, and it was around peak COVID. I had sent everyone home, so it was just me and Andrew coming into the studio to work on building furniture, making videos, and recording the podcast every week. I got here early one summer morning, started settling in, and then there was a knock on the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "I opened the door, and it was Bob. He said, “Hey Marques, there are some people with badges at the front desk to see you. I didn’t let them in, but if you would like to, they’re up there.” Then he walked away. My first thought was confusion. I was like, what? What did I do that made someone with badges show up asking for me? I was a little concerned and unsure about what to think. I stood there for a solid minute, trying to decide whether to go up there or stay in the studio without asking who the people with badges were. Eventually, I decided to go to the front.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got there, sure enough, there were three people with badges, and they walked right up to me and flashed their badges—FBI, just like in the movies. They said, “Marques, good to see you. We’ve got some questions for you about the Escobar phone.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately, I felt relieved, but then it clicked—oh, the Escobar phone. A few months earlier, I had published a video about the Escobar Fold. If you haven't seen that video, the story is about a company selling a $400 gold folding phone that they claimed would rival Apple and Samsung. They had insane marketing campaigns, but as I uncovered in my video, they were just covering Samsung Galaxy Folds with gold stickers and shipping them to YouTubers they thought would talk positively about it, while scamming regular customers out of their money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back, I don’t know how they thought they would get away with it. Their whole plan backfired when I made that video. Fast forward a couple of months, and it makes sense that the FBI and IRS were interested. I just didn't expect them to show up one day, but here we are. Shout out to Bob at the front desk for sticking to our rule, even though he probably had a bunch of people flashing FBI badges at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I brought them back to our spot, and they asked a lot of questions about that video and any communications I had with the company. They wanted every email I had ever sent or received from them. At that time, Andrew had just started running the business email account here. When they asked if anyone else on my team had ever communicated with this company, I thought Andrew might have. He had just arrived at the studio and walked up to the front door, so I called him in. The first thing he saw was me in an empty studio with a bunch of people in suits waving him over—definitely a funny alternate perspective on this story.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FBI took the half-peeled Escobar Fold and the scratched gold iPhone from my videos as evidence in the case. They asked for them and took them away, putting them in sealed plastic bags that said \"evidence.\" That’s why I mentioned at the end of the smartphone awards that year an honorable mention to the Escobar Fold 2, which is also not on my desk because it’s in the possession of the FBI. Someday, I’ll be able to tell that story.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the FBI and IRS were leaving, they asked me not to talk about this publicly. I assured them I wouldn’t interfere with the investigation. I also asked how long before I would be allowed to talk about it, and they said, “We’ll let you know.” So for years, I’ve been biting my tongue, hinting at it a little but not saying anything too serious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, many of the dominoes have started to fall. Initially, when the scam was happening, PayPal stopped working with them, so they switched to a non-refundable direct transfer process with Klarna, and then they stopped working with them too. Eventually, the entire operation began to collapse, and the guy at the head of it, named Olaf Gustafsson, ended up getting arrested and going to prison in Spain for fraud, money laundering, and a variety of other crimes—all related to what I discussed in those videos.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been holding onto this, wondering if it was okay to talk about it now that he was behind bars. We reached out to the same FBI agents who left their cards, and they confirmed it was fine to discuss it. Unfortunately, there’s no footage of the incident, but there are documents they provided as proof that they received my property for the case: one Pablo Escobar Fold 2 mobile flip phone (aka Samsung) and one Pablo Escobar Gold iPhone 11 Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you basically know the story! It’s a pretty serious business, making videos about phones sometimes. If Olaf ever gets charged in the U.S., it’s likely my videos will show up in those court documents, which is quite crazy. Additionally, the phones they took may appear as evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do want to get back into making more investigative deep-dive type videos. Thankfully, giant scams don't happen frequently in the tech world, but they are fascinating stories when they do arise.

      "Okay, so I was listening to the Wired podcast this morning, and they said something that really nailed the way I think about a lot of emerging technologies, especially AI. What they said was that WWDC, which we just had from Apple, basically proved that AI is a feature, not a product. This hit hard for me because that's the exact question we've been asking ourselves for so long here about new technologies: Is it a feature or a product?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll give you an example. Do you remember Clubhouse? We've talked about this before, but back during the pandemic era, Clubhouse experienced a meteoric rise to success. It was a platform for live audio stage events that would disappear after they were over. That was kind of all it was—super simple, but with everyone sitting at home, it blew up in popularity. It skyrocketed to the top of the App Store. Everyone started using it. Major interviews happened on it, and new weekly shows were created. Huge famous people regularly participated in Clubhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "But fast forward literally one year, maybe two, and suddenly Spotify built this feature into their app, Discord built it into theirs with Stages, Slack added it, and even Twitter implemented Spaces. Suddenly, what was once a groundbreaking platform became just a feature inside larger apps. The question then became: Is Clubhouse, this huge thing that came out of nowhere, a product or just a feature? It turned out that the success of all these features in other apps led to Clubhouse's decline, along with many others. We still have Twitter Spaces, but generally, Clubhouse became a feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many examples of this, which is why the product versus feature question keeps coming up. The newest question now is: Is AI a product or a feature? We got to see what it looked like as a standalone product with devices like the Humane AI Pin, which was a dedicated piece of hardware for engaging with AI, and the Rabbit R1, another device promising to be a physical embodiment of an assistant you have everywhere. Both of these devices were not very successful, but let's assume they worked well. That would present AI as a product. You could even consider using the ChatGPT website as AI as a product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, just a few months later, we had Apple's WWDC and Google I/O, which showcased a very different approach. Apple systematically added AI features throughout its operating systems. For example, within any app that can write text, you now have these writing tools powered by new language models that can help summarize, proofread, or change the tone and style of your writing. There’s also a new Siri powered by these language models, allowing for better conversations and contextual understanding. You can even generate images and emojis right from your device. The point is, it's clearly a different way of thinking about AI for consumers—it's just one of the features built into the tools you use.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize this isn't a perfect analogy. One flaw is that while apps like Slack and Twitter integrated audio features similar to Clubhouse, they didn't integrate Clubhouse itself; they built their own versions. Clubhouse was left to die. In Apple's case, it combines two strategies: creating their own models for many features directly on the device and also incorporating a version of ChatGPT into their OS, which ultimately gives ChatGPT more users.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think about this a lot. There’s no clear answer yet on whether AI is a feature or a product. Will one ultimately prevail over the other? We don't know. But based on history, it seems that more people in the long run will opt for AI as a feature, rather than seeking it out as a standalone product. Looking for similar examples, it’s really hard to find cases where an individual product became significantly more successful than the same idea integrated as a feature into larger platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "TikTok might be the best example of the opposite, as it is a vertical video carousel with an algorithm that learns what video you want to see next. Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts have developed similar features within their respective platforms, but TikTok remains the most popular version. Another example could be Snapchat, where Stories became a major feature of the app and later appeared elsewhere, yet Snapchat continues to do well on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question now is whether you need to reach the level of Snapchat or TikTok to succeed as a standalone product in order to compete against the possibility that your idea could simply become a feature. This distinction with AI is fascinating. It also makes me think that devices like Rabbit and Humane were kind of doomed from the start, as they wouldn’t have the benefits of more powerful smartphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I want to highlight something that may not have received as much attention as it deserves: all those models connected with WWDC and categorized as Apple Intelligence—the diffusion model, the image generation model, the language models—are all developed by Apple. There was confusion on Twitter about how integrated ChatGPT is into iOS. In reality, it’s not well integrated. Apple had to build and train these models from scratch, spending millions to gather public data and secure licenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "This presents a high barrier to entry, and it’s only when requests become complex enough or require real-world data that Apple indirectly reaches out to ChatGPT, which feels quite unintegrated. Overall, this is going to be a tough situation for new companies. Unless you’re Apple, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, or other major players, you probably won’t have much of a chance in this space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, this has been an interesting topic to explore. Is AI a product or a feature? Can it be both, or does it have to be one or the other, with a clear winner in the end?

      "- All right, everyone, you have waited patiently for this. Once again this year, we ran our blind smartphone camera test, scientific style. We always think we know what the absolute best smartphone cameras are, but do we actually know? What if we wanted an objective answer straight from real-world data? Every time I review a phone, there are always comments saying, \"iPhone photos are the only good ones,\" or, \"I only like Pixel photos,\" or, \"Samsung is the only one who does good portrait mode.\" But what if we put that to the test? What if we took the best smartphone cameras on the planet, took them out into the real world, and captured the exact same photo with each one, stripped of all their labels, and had you, the public, vote on which photos you liked best? That should reveal the best actual smartphone camera.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that’s exactly what we did. This year, we took 20 smartphones, updated all their software, charged them all up, and got their batteries to 100%. We then took the same three photos with each one: one daytime photo, one low-light photo, and one portrait-mode photo. Yes, it is surprisingly hard to stay perfectly still for 20 identical photos taken in a row, but I did it for you. Then we had to import all the photos from every single smartphone camera. This was harder than you think. We stripped them of all their EXIF data and uploaded them to a site we built that lets us display them side by side for you to vote on head-to-head, millions and millions of times, which you did. This should give us a statistically significant winner—and a loser. We’ll get to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results this year were kind of interesting. I almost didn’t make this video, but people have been waiting, the competitive tension is high, and the actual results might be surprising to some of you. So let’s get into it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The data from our site comes in text files with matchup ratings for every single combination of smartphones. We actually coded them with letters of the alphabet, from A through T. That little number you see is the most important—it's the Elo rating, the system that ranks chess players, tennis players, and basically anything head-to-head. With enough matchup information, we can sort through all of these letters based on who they beat and who they lost to, creating a power ranking that will give us our winners.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you probably want to know who the winners are. We'll go category by category, since we had three different scenarios: daytime, low light, and portrait mode. Let’s start with daytime photos. We had it set up with me sitting in front of a window, but there’s a lot more to this photo. The strongest light comes from inside the room, while the window light is a good test of dynamic range. There’s also a variety of colors—my skin tone, the orange chair next to the blue pillow, and a few other things. This setup was intentional; there’s no individual variable that can dominate the test. \n",
      "\n",
      "For every phone, we tried to frame the shot the same way from the same spot, using one phone as a reference to get as close as possible. Everything was fully auto; we just opened the camera app, made sure the lens was clean, and hit the shutter button. We didn’t even tap to focus—just point and shoot. It takes about six minutes to go through all 20 phones. Like I said, it’s kind of hard to sit still for six minutes straight, but we did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for this regular daylight photo scenario, the winner with the highest Elo rating is the Pixel 7A. That’s pretty impressive! This photo was voted as the winner in most of its matchups. It’s a pretty neutral photo—not too bright, not too dark—and it has excellent dynamic range. This wasn’t a fluke, as the second-highest Elo rating came from the Pixel Fold, which took a very similar photo. Finishing up on the podium was the OnePlus Open, one of those high-end folding phones. My personal favorite photo, which actually won for me in my blind test, was the OnePlus 11. It’s definitely a bit contrasty, but it confidently nails the exposure and dynamic range.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of people pointed out that the sun behind me looked a little different in each photo. It might have been setting, which impacted the background a bit, but it wasn’t late enough in the day for that to affect the photo. The fact that the 7A has this little lens flare is just a coincidence. Fun fact: dead last, with the absolute lowest Elo rating for this daytime photo, is the iPhone 15 Pro. It’s not a terrible photo; you can’t really get a horrible photo in normal-looking lighting with most smartphones. However, up against the others, it’s mostly just the darkest one. People chose the brighter photos almost every single time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, you can absolutely overexpose for this competition, as the second-lowest Elo rating belongs to the Galaxy S23 Ultra, which produced an overexposed masterpiece. Here are all the photos side by side with their Elo ratings. Feel free to pause if you’d like to make more observations, but let’s move on to the nighttime photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Low-light photos are much more challenging for a smartphone camera, especially with a tiny sensor and optics trying to take in as much light as possible. However, computational photography has come a long way. Even in this pretty dark rooftop setting where the only light source was about 40 feet away, these cameras still managed to perform well. Here’s the plot twist: the highest overall Elo rating for the low-light photo comes from the same phone that finished dead last in daylight—the iPhone 15 Pro, with another decent photo. \n",
      "\n",
      "Following closely in second place was the Pixel 8 Pro, with the Pixel 7A coming in third. To be honest, I agree with these rankings. Some smartphone cameras started to overdo the light, so outside of the top four, you dive straight into bad HDR territory. The fifth-place photo, from the S23 Ultra, is definitely too bright and shows an HDR halo effect around my head. When we look down at the Oppo Find X6 Pro’s photo, it seems as if they literally painted over me and dragged up the exposure. The Zenfone did something similar, along with a few others. \n",
      "\n",
      "The OnePlus Open not only made me brighter, but it also darkened the sky, creating a ridiculous effect—real life looked nothing like that. Here are all the nighttime photos with their Elo ratings. Pause if needed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now let’s move to the last but not least category: portrait mode. Portrait mode is often the hardest test to run because different cameras handle it differently. Some do 2X, some do 3X, and some say 1X but are actually around 1.5X; it’s confusing. We tried to keep it simple by switching to portrait mode and adjusting our distance to match the focal length. This worked to some degree, but the bokeh levels varied and some are adjustable while others aren’t. We used the default settings, which most people would choose. \n",
      "\n",
      "The portrait-mode winner with the highest Elo rating is the Pixel 8 Pro. It was closely followed by the Samsung Z Fold 5, which I think had a better cutout. The third-highest Elo was the iPhone 15 Pro, which showed the most natural-looking blur. All of these podium finishers have relatively subtle portrait modes, with good detail and balance in the rest of the photo. \n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, the losers in this category produced some of the weirdest photos in the entire competition. The absolute lowest Elo rating for portrait mode—and indeed for any category—was the Sony Xperia 1 V with a photo that looked like a mistake. We genuinely thought it was a mistake while taking it. We cleaned the lens and took it again, but it kept happening. For whatever reason, this $1,200 Android flagship in auto portrait mode just could not handle the lighting and had some strange issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are all of the portrait-mode photos with their Elo ratings. You’re welcome. Now, I’d like to present some awards. We have all of our matchup data, voting results, and Elo ratings from over 20 million total votes—pretty interesting stuff. We have our winners and losers in each category, which is great. But if we average it all together, we get the highest overall average Elo rating, which we’ll call the People’s Champ. With the highest average of 1,660, the Pixel 7A claimed this title. \n",
      "\n",
      "This phone not only won the daytime photo but also came in third in low light and fourth in portrait mode out of all 20 phones. That’s pretty strong. Here’s the kicker: the second-highest average Elo rating was the Pixel 8 Pro, followed by the Pixel Fold in third. So, it’s a perfect Pixel podium!\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the entire list from top to bottom, with the three Pixels at the top in reverse price order, surprisingly. Bringing up the rear in total Elo is the Sony Xperia 1 V and the Xiaomi 13 Ultra. I also brought back the Bang for the Buck Award, given to the most votes per MSRP at launch. The winner for this is again the Pixel 7A. This phone launched around $500 and performed excellently in tests. \n",
      "\n",
      "In second for votes per dollar is the Nothing Phone 2, a solid upper mid-range phone. In 3A and 3B, we have the OnePlus 11 and the Zenfone 10. Surprisingly, the Sony Xperia didn’t finish dead last in this category; while it was expensive and performed poorly, it did better bang for buck than the more expensive folding phone, the Z Flip 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what did we learn? First of all, the Pixels dominated with a one-two-three finish and are great for bang for buck. It was odd that they were in reverse price order, but that’s fine. There’s a lot more to a smartphone camera than just a staged photo. We learned a bit about how it captures my skin tones, but there are countless factors to consider—auto-focus speed, UI, file format, editability, video quality, etc. At the end of the day, it wasn’t shocking that slightly brighter photos beat slightly less bright ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe we’ll run this test again next year and learn something new. Either way, thanks for watching! Catch you next time. Peace.  \n",

      "\n",

      "Hey, what’s up? MKBHD here, and this is the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. \n",
      "\n",
      "When this first came out and got revealed, it was easy to just write it off as an incremental upgrade. I mean, look at it. Aesthetically speaking, it’s basically the same phone. The side radii are squared off more, so it feels a bit better in the hand—much more boxy like the Notes of the past. There are also slightly bigger rings around the cameras, and it’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 instead of Victus Plus. But as far as size, industrial design, button placement, and ports, it’s basically the same phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are two real upgrades to this phone. Keep in mind that this is replacing the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which was already my best big phone of the year from last year. The battery, screen, and performance were all rock solid across the board, so there’s not a lot that I would naturally want to change. But there are two things that are arguably the most important: the chip that runs it all and the cameras.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might have heard about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. It’s been a really good chip in other phones it’s been in, offering excellent CPU and GPU performance that’s also very efficient, which impacts battery life. The entire S23 lineup comes with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, a customized version of the chip specifically for these Samsung phones. If you watched my last video about how Apple is taking back the iPhone, then you know that optimization and customization for parts inside phones is typically a good thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only customization we’ve really seen for this chip is a slightly higher max clock speed on the performance core and a slightly higher clock speed on the GPU—3.36GHz instead of 3.2 on the performance core and 719MHz versus 680 on the GPU. So yeah, it does score slightly better in benchmarks than the regular Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which is nice for a little extra headroom for high-performance tasks, light gaming, and future-proofing. But that’s not the whole story.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two main things that matter here: one is efficiency gains. Obviously, performance is awesome, but with better efficiency, these phones get some serious battery life improvements that we’ll talk about in a second. The other is that there’s no more Exynos, as they aren’t making an Exynos version of this phone anywhere. Every S23 Ultra is shipping with a Qualcomm chip, so everyone gets the efficiency and performance gains from the Qualcomm version.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you, the battery life on this phone has been incredible—really, really good. It's a 5,000mAh battery again, which shouldn’t be a surprise, but with this huge screen, I guess it kind of is. I had a two-day period at 120Hz but 1080p resolution, where the only time I charged it was using the wireless charger in my car during my 40-minute drive to and from the studio. I didn’t charge it overnight or anything like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Two fully packed days of high brightness and high intensity, with normal use for me, ended up with something like eight and a half hours of screen-on time. I was in bed at about 11 PM on the second day, streaming on YouTube live while watching LeBron break Kareem’s record, and it still had approximately 10% left—it just wouldn’t die.\n",
      "\n",
      "So combining this excellent battery life with solid 45W charging that can go from zero to 100% in an hour, plus wireless charging, gives you a battery monster. It’s super impressive. I don’t think enough people are talking about how much better the battery life has gotten. Maybe someone will do one of those crazy long runtime demos versus the past phone, but it’s really good—probably better than you think. You don’t need to switch to 1080p to save battery; in fact, when you take it out of the box, just go ahead and switch it to 1440p because you spent $1,200 on this phone, and it lasts forever. Treat yourself!\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, anyway, that’s the chip—that’s what it enables. There’s also a new set of cameras, with hardware and software across the board that’s better than you might think. The fundamentals are mostly the same, which is why this phone probably gets written off quickly. The layout, aesthetics, focal lengths, and arrangement are all pretty much the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "But we do have a new 200-megapixel primary camera with double the optical image stabilization (OIS) range compared to before—that’s hugely important. There are new sensors across the ultra-wide, 3X telephoto, and 10X periscope cameras. Now, we keep saying that cameras are mostly about software, and for the look and style of the photos, that remains true. But the improvement to stabilization is so important. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you go from a normal sensor to a super high-resolution 200-megapixel sensor, in these tiny smartphone cameras, the individual pixels are so small that they can’t bring in that much light individually. The camera does this thing called pixel binning, which combines information from multiple adjacent pixels to form larger, more accurate pixels in your final image. So you’re not shooting 200 megapixels by default; it’s actually binning 16 pixels into one, resulting in a 12.5-megapixel shot for normal photos. Each photo is theoretically more accurate because of how it’s constructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned, the stabilization performance on the new primary camera has also doubled. (phone rattles) It still rattles a little bit, but that means it can now correct up to three degrees of shake versus the 1.5 degrees from before. For example, if you have a lens with good optical image stabilization, (lens rattles) it can correct for more movement in your hand. This allows you to hold the camera stable for longer, letting the shutter stay open to collect more light while still getting a sharp photo.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, all of this means that photos from the Galaxy S23 Ultra, most of the time in most lighting conditions, look pretty similar to last year. If that’s all you’re judging it on—just normal side-by-sides—this largely comes down to different software tuning. There’s a bit more dynamic range than last year, and the photos are typically warm from these Samsung phones with a slightly punchier, more contrasty look than before. They still stay true to the Samsung aesthetic of being colorful and saturated, which is an aesthetic I really like. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, having this new sensor and optical stabilization means you can shoot literally 200-megapixel photos if you want to. This allows for capturing much more detail in landscapes. If you plan on zooming in on shots later, or if you’re one of the few people who will actually print a smartphone photo, this capability is there for you. However, keep in mind that it really needs excellent lighting to produce those results; otherwise, you’re going to get a lot of noise. \n",
      "\n",
      "And speaking of noise, there’s also considerable shutter lag with these massive 40-50 megabyte files. Granted, this mode is mostly for things that are stationary, like landscapes or photo shoots, but it’s worth noting. A better compromise is the 50-megapixel mode, which produces detailed images that hold up well against the iPhone's 48-megapixel ProRAW shots in various lighting conditions. In this mode, however, the files are about five megabytes, and there’s much less shutter lag, but you still benefit from improved detail over regular binned shots and experience less noise. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s all about flexibility. The standard mode is going to be best for most shots most of the time, but you can always bump it up if you want. This is also true for the zoom; any phone with two different telephoto cameras is going to provide the best range of good zoom performance. For this phone, anything past 10X really shines compared to others. You might have seen my recent clip of taking a photo of the full moon—it seems to blow people’s minds every time they see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we can’t forget about video. This phone has improved video across the board, thanks to better processing, new sensors, and the much better stabilization due to the enhanced OIS. This might be the best super steady mode I’ve ever seen in smartphone video, and because it’s based on optical stabilization, it works well in various lighting conditions—unlike some electronic image stabilization, which relies on abundant light.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of all that, the 8K video on this smartphone is very usable. Previous phones with 8K video often capped at 24 frames per second, which isn’t ideal for video. This phone offers 8K at 30 frames per second, which is great. If you put it side-by-side with 4K, you can see the sharpness difference if you zoom in. For a sample, the latest focus video I shot in my car is in 8K from this phone, and you can check it out on YouTube right now. Don’t forget to hit that like button if you enjoy it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yeah, and also, let’s talk about the improved selfies. There’s a new 12-megapixel selfie camera in all these S23 phones. While the megapixel count is lower than the 40-megapixel selfie camera that came before it, it’s actually better. It’s solid proof that megapixels don’t always matter. This selfie camera, with enhanced software processing, is very sharp and detailed, has nice color, and doesn’t flare too much. Plus, it has a decently wide angle—not ultra-wide but still good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the board, this is a significant and extensive improvement to the camera, especially the primary camera, which feels overlooked when people review the phone. The one complaint I still have is that there is still shutter lag, which is different from the slow shutter speed. The time gap between pressing the shutter button and actually capturing the photo is still noticeable and can be annoying, even if you capture a crisp photo of the wrong moment. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned earlier, the lag is more pronounced when shooting ultra-high resolution 50-megapixel or 200-megapixel photos—you can’t exactly take those in rapid succession. But if the question is, “Did they make a meaningful improvement from last year’s phone?” I would say yes. Between the new chip, better overall performance, much better efficiency resulting in huge battery life improvements, and the new cameras with better sensors and processing, plus much better stabilization, it’s clear they’ve made real strides.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I don’t really need to say too much about the rest because it’s the same as before, which is a good thing given that last year’s phone was considered the best. All the features that made it the top big phone are still present, and they’re not minor things either. \n",
      "\n",
      "I haven’t even talked about the A+ display—1440p, 120Hz LTPO, 1,750 nits peak brightness—it’s still awesome. It still has great speakers, reliable software with a good track record for timely updates, and the base storage has actually increased from 128GB to 256GB, now featuring faster UFS 4.0 storage. It also still has the best stylus in a smartphone worldwide, which might mean more to you than it does to me. Still, it’s nice to know I can at any time mark up a screenshot or sign a PDF. \n",
      "\n",
      "And the list goes on: great haptic feedback, nice clicky buttons—all of it is still here. This phone sets the standard pretty high. My analogy is that it feels like the “Portion 9/11” of smartphones. If you're going to charge $1,200 for a phone, it better hit high marks across the board—and it does. It’s pretty underrated, kind of boring, but it does its job well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if you want the S23 Ultra to look as improved as it actually is, I would recommend a skin from our channel sponsor, dbrand—maybe something like this Damascus skin, which adds a lot of character where it would ordinarily be pretty blank. My favorite is the Triple Black, which is included for free when you pick up any of the holographic colorways. You can check them out at the link below.\n",
      "\n",
      "I say this phone is boring, but I think “understated” might be the better word. Will other phones come out this year that exceed this phone in certain categories? Yeah, definitely. There are probably going to be phones with 120X zoom and much faster charging—this one is only 45W charging. Do I wish that was better? A little bit, sometimes. Is there going to be a phone with a much bigger, better, faster fingerprint reader? \n",
      "\n",
      "(soft bright music) \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, probably. But as far as just nailing all the marks across the board, this phone does it. In terms of the overall package, Samsung’s software is settled, the screen is sublime, it still has the best stylus, and it captures significantly smoother shots. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for watching—catch you guys in the next one! Peace.\n",

      "We just wrapped up what might be one of the biggest Apple WWDC keynotes ever, possibly due to the current state of the world and the high expectations surrounding tech companies in 2024, especially in regard to AI. Interestingly, Apple placed AI at the back half of their presentation; they didn't mention it at all in the first hour. Then in the second hour, they essentially said, \"Okay, we actually have a lot of AI features to share,\" and then presented them all at once. They even branded it as \"Apple Intelligence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I watched and live-tweeted the entire two-hour keynote, so you don’t have to. Here are my thoughts on the key announcements, organized in the same order that Apple presented them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with VisionOS, we're already on VisionOS 2.0 less than six months after the Vision Pro was first announced. There are some solid new features, but I hesitate to call this a 2.0 worthy update; it feels more like a 1.2 update. However, there is a new wrist turn gesture that allows you to quickly check the time and battery percentage, enabling you to jump straight into the control center without having to glance up at the ceiling like before. It reminds me of the Oculus Quest—it's a nice improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there are immersive media features, such as the ability to browse old photos and use advanced machine learning to turn them into spatial photos. If it works well, that could be interesting. There are also new tools for creating spatial and immersive videos on cameras other than the iPhone, but they can only be viewed on the Vision Pro, so their practical value is uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, Mac mirroring will enjoy a significant resolution boost due to foveated rendering on the Mac. This change frees up a lot of resources, allowing for up to double the resolution. It means more room for windows and activities, which is fantastic. Overall, while the 2.0 update isn’t groundbreaking, it does introduce some appealing features, including new environments and the ability to rearrange your home screen—something you couldn’t do before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of home screen customization, iOS has now received one of its most significant updates in a long time. If you’re an Android user, feel free to take a quick break for the next few minutes. Yes, Android has had these features for a while, but now it's the iPhone's turn to shine. You can finally place icons wherever you want on the iOS 18 home screen grid. It was amusing to see it receive applause during the keynote, as if it were a groundbreaking new feature. Nevertheless, Apple fans have waited a long time for this.\n",
      "\n",
      "They haven't stopped there. Numerous other customization features have been added, including a new theme engine that lets you change the color of every icon and widget on your home screen to match your wallpaper—a simple update that Android users have enjoyed for years. Before this, every iPhone home screen looked largely the same, but now users have the freedom to customize it, which can lead to some questionable designs. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ability to create unappealing home screens is apparent on Twitter, with many looking quite chaotic. Some apps support this theme well, while others end up with icons that appear just tinted, causing legibility issues. So, while you can create aesthetic home screens, it’s just as easy to create a confusing mess. \n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to gauge if I liked this more or less than Google's Material You on Pixel devices. Technically, Apple's solution is better because it allows changes to all icons at once. So, you don’t have to deal with certain apps standing out awkwardly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has also redesigned the Control Center to be fully customizable across multiple pages, providing more shortcuts and options. Now you can finally replace the flashlight and camera icons on the home screen without jailbreaking your device. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are also hidden apps you can place in your app drawer, making it easier to conceal apps like Tinder. You can now schedule text messages in iMessage—finally! Apple is starting to add some fun features. Other updates include message formatting, satellite messaging, and a redesigned Photos app. There's even a game mode that minimizes background activity and reduces Bluetooth latency. Plus, the Mail app is getting automatic categorization.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are numerous enhancements. I’ll likely create a detailed video focused solely on iOS 18 to cover all these updates since there are plenty of minor features not included in the keynote. So be sure to subscribe to catch that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to AirPods, they received minor updates like voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio for gaming, and the ability to respond to prompts with nods or shakes—similar to Sony headphones. I appreciate that you can now control them without using your voice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Apple TV has a new feature that allows you to swipe down on the remote at any point during a show to see a real-time list of actors and character names, as well as any song playing at that moment. There’s also a feature that boosts dialogue audio, making it easier to hear over the music.\n",
      "\n",
      "In watchOS, there's a new training mode that helps balance your workout trends and evaluates your effort relative to your potential. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for iPadOS, this was Apple's big chance to convince everyone why the new iPad—now with the M4 chip—is worth considering over a phone or Mac. It does receive a fantastic feature, but otherwise, it doesn't significantly differ from the iPhone updates. The iPad will have full home screen customization, a redesigned Photos app, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the standout feature is the newly introduced Calculator app. Initially, I was prepared to criticize the launch, thinking, “Really? This is the big news?” But they showcased something called Math Notes, allowing users to handwrite equations, which the device can recognize and solve in your handwriting. If you update the equation, it will automatically adjust the answer. It also supports variables, enabling you to solve equations while seeing real-time graphs—a really impressive addition for users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, they hadn’t mentioned \"AI\" at all during the main part of the keynote. This handwriting recognition and semantic understanding clearly fall under AI capabilities—a clever move from Craig. But that’s before the actual AI section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for macOS, the newest version is called Sequoia, featuring a collection of new tools. There's automatic window snapping, eliminating the need for a third-party app, and a password manager that now stands alone as an app instead of being buried in settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most notable feature is iPhone Mirroring, which allows you to effortlessly see your iPhone screen on your Mac wirelessly. It merges notifications and audio from your iPhone to your Mac, making it convenient to drag and drop files back and forth. I do wonder about the impact on battery life, but if you’re just charging, it shouldn't be an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we arrived at the section where Apple would discuss AI. They finally addressed it following months of speculation about why they were avoiding the term. Apple has rebranded the concept as \"Apple Intelligence.\" It's worth noting that Apple has already had AI features, like the Neural Engine in their chips, smart subject removal in photos, and auto-complete on keyboards. \n",
      "\n",
      "This new Apple Intelligence combines generative models and new functionalities. However, these features are only available on the highest-end versions of Apple silicon: the iPhone 15 Pro, and any iPad or Mac with M1 or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the latest OSs, there’s a collection of tools that are spread across various applications; there’s no standalone Apple Intelligence app. For instance, in writing tools, you can now use large language models in apps like Pages or Keynote to summarize or rewrite text, change writing styles, or proofread.\n",
      "\n",

      "You know what's funny? When there aren't many changes, it really puts a magnifying glass on the few changes that do exist. Have you ever listened to a car reviewer describe the latest generation of the Porsche 911? This is a car that has looked more or less the same for the past 50 years, with slight evolutions in each new generation. And literally, every time you watch or read a review, they always say, \"Oh, it's so refined! This is an engineering masterpiece that's been perfected over generations. It's a formula that’s been developed in the same direction for years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As a kid, I used to actively dislike Porsches because I knew they were expensive, but I thought they all looked so boring. Why would you get one of those when you could choose a much more exciting Ferrari or McLaren instead? But as I’ve gotten older, I can appreciate the Porsche formula a little more. I wouldn’t say I love it, but I can appreciate it more. Does that make sense? I hope that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the iPhone 15 Pro. Not a lot has changed. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, okay, I think people have to get this thought out of their heads: you don't have to upgrade every year to the newest phone. I realize most of us already know this, but for some reason, people still cling to this idea that “last year’s phone is barely different from this year’s phone, so it’s not worth upgrading.” But that’s not new. For example, the Zenfone 10 I just reviewed is just a refinement of the Zenfone 9. The top-of-the-line ROG phone has looked the same for three years now, and the Pixel is finally finding its stride with design.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we’re really looking for is for them to fix anything that’s wrong or bad, and then to find clever and interesting ways to make slight improvements every year. Over a long time, those small changes add up to a bigger, more significant change. That’s what’s happening here with the iPhone 15 Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been using it for about two weeks now. They have made some improvements, but we’re also starting to see some possible problems, some new issues that have come up. So let’s talk about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are basically four new features they've added here. I'm going to cover some of the more fundamental and existential stuff in the regular iPhone 15 review, so definitely make sure you’re subscribed to see that when it comes out. But for the Pro, it's time to deep dive into the stuff that’s unique to this model: the build, the chip, the cameras, and the Action Button.\n",
      "\n",
      "The easiest place to start is with the way they’ve built this phone. Apple made updates to the build and materials of the iPhone this year. They’ve softened the corners a bit; it’s still clearly a boxy design, but now, instead of a completely flat glass front, there’s a gentle curve at the very edges. This might make screen protectors slightly more intricate, but I think it has a nice look to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The screen sizes are exactly the same, but now the bezels are actually a tiny bit slimmer all around. Technically, the phone is about one millimeter smaller diagonally, and the rails have switched from shiny stainless steel to a lighter, coated, and brushed titanium. The result is very slightly better. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s kind of funny; I’ve always associated a heavy phone with an expensive feel. The ceramic phones are extra heavy; they feel substantial. But I understand why people want it lighter. This phone is actually noticeably lighter than the previous Pro. It’s 10% lighter on paper, but it feels like more.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a new set of colors, too. I’m sticking with this new natural titanium color; it’s the best one. This is the first year I’m not ordering a dark or black iPhone. They still look good, but they pick up fingerprints like crazy. My concerns about light-colored scratches were confirmed by Zack from JerryRigEverything in his video. Since I’m on team no case, I chose the all-gray phone; I think it looks dope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, if you have a perfectly working phone, there's no reason to upgrade to this one just for the titanium build or the slightly thinner bezels. However, if you put this next to an iPhone 11, you can see the differences that have compounded over time, similar to how sitting in a 992 generation 911 versus a 997 generation car feels different.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real highlight of this build, let’s be honest, is the new port at the bottom: USB Type-C. This makes a big difference for people like me who have other gadgets—computers, headphones, a mouse, and a keyboard. Now I can just bring one charger that works with everything. I’ve already had that moment that everyone who gets this phone has when you try to plug in an existing Lightning cable and realize, oh right, new cable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could have sworn Apple would do more with this port. We know they were basically forced into it by the EU, so shout out to the EU for that. Now we have a USB iPhone, but the only pitch is just, \"Hey, one cable for everything.\" Seriously, Apple? With the switch from 30-pin to Lightning all those years ago, the benefits were obvious. It’s significantly smaller, allowing more room inside the phone, plus it’s reversible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, USB Type-C is already small and reversible. The charging speed hasn’t improved at all; it’s still 25 watts. There’s no extra \"desktop mode\" or anything like that; it’s just one cable for everything. Okay, fine. Welcome to the club. iPhone users can now take advantage of USB-C. \n",
      "\n",
      "I talked about its ability to handshake with other devices for reverse charging at 4.5 watts in the unboxing video; that’s neat. You can also plug in other things, like keyboards and monitors; it mirrors your screen at up to 4K 60 frames per second. The Pro phone now supports USB 3.0 data transfer speeds, allowing you to transfer ProRes footage off the phone noticeably faster. You can also shoot video directly onto an external drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there’s some talk about the cable that comes in the box. Remember that nice high-quality braided USB-C cable? It only supports USB 2.0 transfer speeds, which means it’s a slow cable. So if you have a Pro phone, you’ll need a faster separate cable for it. That seemed weird to some, but it’s normal. Most smartphones come with just a USB-C cable for charging. If you want a data cable, you must buy a thicker, more robust one that looks the same but is meant for data. It’s kind of confusing and annoying, actually. \n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome to the world of USB-C, my friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a good segue into the main enabler, the new powerhouse chip inside this phone, known as the A17 Pro. The base iPhone 15s come with last year’s A16 Bionic from the 14 Pro. So here’s this new, more powerful chip in the highest-end phones. It’s not just called the A17 Bionic; this is the first one with the Pro name, A17 Pro. This thing is pretty impressive on paper. It’s Apple’s first three-nanometer chip and the first three-nanometer chip in any phone we’ll probably see for at least another year or two. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ran some benchmarks, and it’s literally approaching the levels of scores seen on the M1 chip. Compared to last year, it’s 10 to 20% more powerful on both CPU and GPU, which is very respectable. More power is like more horsepower in a car: it only really matters if it lets you do more with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last-generation Porsche 911 Turbo S was already incredibly fast; you never approached its limits anywhere on public streets unless you’re at the highest end of performance on the track. The same goes for the Pro iPhone; it’s been great for basic tasks like surfing Instagram or texting. The only place you really notice the extra performance is during gaming. Apple showed wild gaming demos on the new iPhone at the keynote. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a disclaimer, I'm not much of a phone gamer, so I’ll defer commentary on that to Dave2D; you can check out his video linked below. But they literally launched exclusive games on the iPhone, like \"Resident Evil: Village\" and \"Assassin's Creed,\" but not cut-down mobile versions—these are the exact versions from the PlayStation. That’s impressive. Plus, having performance headroom is never a bad thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For me, and I think for many others, the more impactful things that you’ll notice about this new chip are in the dedicated parts for specific tasks. The new image signal processor allows for extremely fast, lag-free photos. The new neural engine can automatically recognize Portrait Mode subjects, like people’s faces and pets. It even lets you go back and set a regular photo to Portrait Mode. The USB 3 controller that enables faster data transfer speeds is also part of the A17 Pro, which comes from the new chip.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I’m currently more concerned about battery life. There are two main issues popping up, and I’m trying to figure out if they’re isolated problems or actual issues with the phone: battery life and overheating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Objectively speaking, these phones have slightly bigger batteries than last year’s models alongside the new three-nanometer chip. In controlled environments, they should perform better, and they do; they literally last longer on simple benchmark tests, so that’s good news.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I test a phone, I go by feel and generally have some good days, some average days, and a few bad days. I try to figure out what drains the battery and identify its weaknesses to reach a conclusion. After a couple of weeks in, I’ve had several average days and a couple of those bad draining days, but I haven’t experienced any amazing days with nine hours of screen-on time. I just haven't had any yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, we started seeing headlines about possibly worse battery life and reports of overheating on Twitter, with some people asking if I’ve had any issues. Here’s the weird answer: yes, but not when I would expect. \n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of days ago, I was at a golf tournament in Florida with a feels-like temperature around 100 degrees. I was outside all day with my phone at max brightness, GPS running, and it was fine—no overheating issues. However, a couple of hours later on an airplane, with my phone in Airplane Mode, just playing music via Bluetooth with Spotify and scrolling through Instagram, the phone got really hot and drained about 5% of battery in just five minutes. Then it was fine again, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason why this happens randomly. \n",
      "\n",
      "My best theory is that the A17 Pro is a more powerful chip and can drain power more quickly in high-intensity settings like gaming. There have also been mentions of iOS 17 bugs; we're currently on version 17.0.2, and I suspect more updates are coming for both iOS and various apps. By the end of this, I feel like the battery life will basically even out to be the same as last year, which is a boring answer but that’s what I expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we can discuss what \"Pro\" actually means in a smartphone context. With iPhones, this has primarily meant cameras, and there is a lot going on with these cameras, both in hardware and software. \n",
      "\n",
      "You’re looking at a new, larger 48-megapixel main camera, an improved ultra-wide with closer macro capability, and a whole telephoto situation we’ll dig into shortly. Software-wise, there’s a new image processing pipeline happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know how most smartphones (many today have 48-megapixel cameras) bin down to 12-megapixel shots? Previous iPhones did this too. The new model, for those who may have missed it, is by default producing 24-megapixel images instead of 12, with just about one and a half times the file size.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new process is actually the same across the board for the iPhone 15s and 15 Pros. It takes a full 48-megapixel sensor shot for detail information and a full 12-megapixel shot, then uses neural net technology to combine them and generate a detailed hybrid 24-megapixel image. It’s very complicated and clever, and the end result is slightly better.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you look at photos shot on this camera, they’re classic iPhone photos—they look pretty great with excellent dynamic range and sharpness. I still prefer and often shoot in the rich contrast profile, but mostly, the iPhone remains one of the best cameras for just pointing and shooting in full-auto mode, producing results that look good even if they don’t exactly resemble real life. It uses classic relighting, tone mapping, and everything we’re used to from smart HDR.\n",
      "\n",
      "The improved Macro Mode is also impressive. With the natural fall-off from the primary camera without needing Portrait Mode, you can achieve blurred backgrounds, which is awesome. Autofocus is incredibly fast, especially when there’s a face in the scene, making it a camera that loves detecting faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of the larger sensor also show at night, with longer handheld captures. While it’s not magic, it’s simply physics. Does the 24-megapixel image make a difference over 12 megapixels? Well, zoomed out, not really; they look almost identical. It's not until you zoom all the way in that you begin to notice a difference in detail and contrast. \n",
      "\n",
      "The 15 Pro is definitely more contrasty and sharp when pixel peeping at full zoom compared to last year. Of course, once you get past 2X zoom, it returns to producing standard 12-megapixel images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it’s a small, incremental improvement. If you look at the Pro phones, they’ve set a couple of presets from the 1X lens: there’s a 24mm all the way zoomed out, a little tighter at 28mm, and a 35mm that have their own dedicated image processing pipelines for maximizing detail in these essentially super-res, zoom focal lengths you can digitally zoom between. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn’t exactly say it has extra lenses, but there’s a slight difference in zoom functionality year over year that you can notice. The most Pro aspect of these new phones, though, is indisputably their video capabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "The iPhone's video capabilities have been far ahead of the rest of the smartphone competition. It doesn’t even shoot 8K, which it’s capable of doing with the 48-megapixels; I wish they would incorporate that feature. However, even just at 4K 30 in full auto mode, the detail, autofocus, slight depth, dynamic range, and stabilization are world-class.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you'd like to see test footage, the entire Rivian delivery van review I did on the Auto Focus channel was shot using the iPhone 15 Pro, audio included. I’ll drop the link below if you want to check it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, you can also shoot in Log, a feature typically reserved for professional cameras. Unfortunately, it's buried several layers deep in the Settings app, which isn’t very Pro. However, if you find the time to switch to Log mode, it allows the iPhone to capture way more information with that flat look, dynamic range, and more. You don’t have to deal with Apple’s typical processing techniques. Apple has its own transformation LUT for converting it to SDR or HDR, or you can fully grade it yourself, which can yield impressive results.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do want to point out one issue, though: the haloing from point light sources. This is one of the most challenging optics issues; I understand why they haven't fully fixed it yet, but it’s notable. Anytime there are point lights, especially in video, the effect can be pretty dramatic, and it seems to be the worst on the iPhone compared to other phones. If that's the most significant downside to iPhone video, then I’ll gladly accept it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the larger model is the only one that comes equipped with the new 5X telephoto lens. I’d bet that this feature will eventually make its way down to the smaller 16 Pro next year, but for now, it’s exclusive to the larger model. This lens allows for max zoom from 15X to 25X, which can be nice for those who frequently take zoomed photos and videos. However, it’s important to note that not many people should buy this phone solely for this lens, as it requires a larger device and could potentially result in worse 4X photos before you hit 5X.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its capabilities don’t quite measure up to some longer telephoto periscope lenses; for example, Samsung has a 10X optical lens that outperforms this one in terms of reach. Apple’s main advantage really lies in stabilization. They’ve finally added a zoom preview window in the viewfinder and optimized stabilization, allowing you to zoom all the way in without jitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m going to borrow a line from Mr. Mobile, who summed it up well: much of the difference between these cameras—the iPhone, the last one, and others like Samsung and Pixel—is predominantly software-based, making comparisons less straightforward. If you want a definitive verdict on the iPhone 15 Pro side by side with Samsung, Pixel, or Oppo, you’ll need to factor in personal taste and experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is especially true when it comes to usability—how you shoot photos and videos. I also want to mention the RAW Max button; it’s amusing. This button captures full-res 48-megapixel Pro RAW photos, but it just says RAW Max. To take a 48-megapixel JPEG, you have to dive back into Settings, switch it, and return, at which point the button changes to JPEG Max—also pretty funny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, this new Pro phone has an Action Button—only for this model because only 'pros' need customization. I kind of love the Action Button, but I realize it’s either overrated or underrated depending on who you are. On one hand, it’s a customizable button—who saw that coming? It replaces the least-used button from previous iPhones since your phone should always be on mute anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can map this Action Button to almost anything you want: keep it as a mute switch, and it has the same strong haptics to tell if it’s muted or unmuted in your pocket. There are also many other cool functions you can choose from, like launching your camera or voice recorder, or just any app via Siri Shortcut. Your favorite YouTube channel is probably making a tutorial on the best Siri Shortcuts to map to the Action Button.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, I feel many people will play with it for a few days, then forget about it. I think this is mainly due to its placement; it’s not very reachable. On the Pro Max, it’s way up in the corner above the volume buttons. It could be a good shutter button for the camera, but the volume buttons already do that, so I suspect many will simply reset it to mute and forget about it after a few weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I guess that’s fine too; it’s one of those things you’ll just figure out how you’d use it after some time. This is similar to my experience with the Eight Sleep mattress cover. I’ve been using it for about three months now. \n",
      "\n",
      "This pod cover goes on your mattress, warming or cooling you to help with sleep. Initially, I was a skeptic, but now I notice I have a harder time sleeping in hotel beds. I sleep so much better on the Eight Sleep bed because it cools down to help you fall asleep faster and warms up in the morning to ease you awake. \n",
      "\n",
      "Temperature has proven to be a crucial factor in sleep quality, making it clear to me that better sleep and being able to depend on a good night’s rest is something I wouldn’t trade for anything. It took some time to realize that. Plus, there’s an app that displays all my sleep stats every night, letting me adjust the autocontrol if needed. If your partner sleeps on the other side of the bed, they can adjust their side’s temperature from the app too—it’s fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll leave a link below. Since they’re a great sponsor, they’re giving you guys $200 off the pod cover if you use code \"MKBHD\" at eightsleep.com/mkbhd. \n",
      "\n",
      "But anyway, what’s the verdict on the new Pro iPhone of 2023? I often have conversations with friends that require me to condense everything into one sentence, and the truth is: it’s essentially the same phone as last year but with USB, a somewhat faster chip, a slightly brighter screen, thinner bezels, and, I don’t know, improved cameras—that’s kind of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "So you have to decide how much of that matters to you. Is any of it important to you? Honestly, USB might be the most significant thing about the new iPhone, despite what Apple hoped. \n",
      "\n",

      "All right, welcome to the Smartphone Awards 2023! A lot of smartphones come out every year, and this year is no different. We have all kinds of shapes, sizes, features, and budgets—a ton of phones! \n",
      "\n",
      "So, like clockwork, at the end of the year, you can count on me to pick some favorites across various categories. This is a summary of the best and some of the worst phones of 2023. These are my picks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always know I’ll get some pushback on certain categories. I’m sure I’ll hear it in the comments, and I'm fine with that. But these are my choices, and I’m sticking with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "The way this works is I’ll break this down into the usual categories, with each category featuring one winner. Plus, of course, there can be a runner-up and maybe some honorable mentions if we're feeling generous. We’ve had custom trophies made for the winners, and lately, the companies that win actually request them and sometimes end up displaying them in their headquarters, which is super cool for the recognition. So, we’re doing it again!\n",
      "\n",
      "Without further ado, let’s get started with our first category: Best Big Smartphone. This is a fun category, as smartphones have been growing over the years, and they seem to be getting bigger. At this point, it feels like they’ve stopped growing. Am I the only one who feels this way? It seems we’ve all agreed not to pass the seven-inch screen size; anything over that feels ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, all these big companies are pushing right up against that seven-inch screen size, trying to fit as much as possible into these phones. There’s a lot of competition in this category. My winner for the Best Big Phone, the best use of that space in 2023, is the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once again, this phone came out at the beginning of the year—a bit of a sleeper—but it holds steady throughout the year. The design is pretty understated, which is probably why it goes under the radar. It has all the hardware you could want: a corner-to-corner 6.8-inch display that’s super bright, quad HD, LTPO, 120 Hz. \n",
      "\n",
      "It features quad cameras on the back and a 5,000 milliamp battery. It’s powered by the second latest generation Snapdragon chip. Again, it was released in January, and it has room for a stylus inside without really sacrificing anything. This thing is packed with hardware and has received software updates all year, with many more promised. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s tough to pick just one standout feature. It might not be the huge 1440p screen or the 200-megapixel main camera, but I actually think it’s the massive zoom. For anyone interested in shooting subjects from far away, this camera system feels unmatched. It’s perhaps a bit boring, but it’s my clear pick for Best Big Phone of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do have a runner-up, and it’s not-so-obvious. With these new phones blurring the lines, I’m giving my runner-up for Best Big Phone to the OnePlus Open. It definitely deserves a mention because, when it’s open, it becomes almost an eight-inch square display. This folding phone has all the hardware and software features you could want, and I really enjoyed using it this year, despite its size.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to give honorable mentions for Best Big Phone to the Asus ROG Phone 7 and the Oppo Find X6 Pro. Neither of these phones is lacking anything. The boring choice won, but maybe if this one had wireless charging or that one had more zoom, it could have been in contention. Still, these are two excellent giant phones that came out this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up: Best Compact Smartphone. This one is tough, as the pickings get slimmer every year. Smartphones are getting bigger and even the smallest phones from the biggest companies are moving further away from being small. For example, do we call the Pixel 7a small? That’s a 6.1-inch screen. Or the Galaxy S23, the baseline model, which is also 6.1 inches. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s increasingly challenging to find a truly small phone that has all the flagship features. However, one phone really stood out. My pick for the Best Small Phone is the Asus Zenfone 10. This flagship packs everything you need and more in a phone that you can actually use with one hand, with a 5.9-inch display.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m thrilled this phone exists. When I reviewed the Zenfone 9 last year, I said it was nearly perfect but just missed a couple of things. When I reviewed the Zenfone 10 this year, they fixed those nitpicks, added wireless charging, improved the durability of the back, and made some software tweaks. It’s nearly flawless.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re considering buying a small phone, honestly, this may be one of the last good ones available. If you're in the market for a mini smartphone, act fast because they’re disappearing. The only other phone that could technically qualify would be some of the folding or flipping phones. Chief among them is Samsung’s Z Flip 5. \n",

      "When it’s opened, the Z Flip 5 has a 6.7-inch screen, but it folds down to a much smaller form factor than others. So even though it’s not the most one-hand-friendly device, it qualifies as smaller. A shout-out to the Z Flip 5 for the honorable mention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto the Best Camera in a smartphone for 2023. I have a soft spot for this category because I love cameras, and you already knew that. There have been a lot of intriguing developments pushing the boundaries for smartphone cameras this past year, especially concerning optical hardware and software processing, including AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might make an entire video just on how crazy it’s gotten, but my pick for the best camera of 2023 is the iPhone 15 Pro. This is my camera king, and I have absolutely no regrets about it. Many people like to point out that there are smartphones—even some on this table—that can produce better photos than the iPhone in certain situations, especially for zoom.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when it comes to overall performance across a broad range of situations and ease of use for both photos and videos, the iPhone is still king. Particularly for video, it remains unchallenged. The iPhone captures the best, most consistent, usable videos across the largest variety of situations more than any other smartphone. \n",
      "\n",
      "This year, they also added log recording to the Pro models and can record directly to an external SSD. There was an Apple keynote earlier this year that was shot entirely on the iPhone, and it looked incredible. Some of you may remember that Samsung did a live keynote years ago, but you could tell it didn’t measure up. \n",
      "\n",
      "This phone produces incredible results. If you told me I could only have one smartphone camera for the next five years, I think I would quickly say, “All right, let’s go with the iPhone 15 Pro.” I’d also like to give an honorable mention to the Galaxy S23 Ultra. This phone, particularly for its zoom capabilities, has been an excellent stills camera for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reviewed it and found that the 200 megapixel feature didn’t yield a dramatically better outcome than the 100-megapixel cameras, but it’s still really good. Shout out to the winners of our scientific blind smartphone camera test that we ran online this year. \n",
      "\n",
      "We collected data from 20 smartphones that came out in 2023. The overall most popular winner for standard photos was the Pixel 7a. For low-light photos, the winner was the iPhone 15 Pro, and for portrait photos, the winner was the Pixel 8 Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next category: Best Value. This has shifted over the years; it used to be called Best Budget Phone, but I’ve expanded it to Best Value Option. This category is the hardest for me to pick this year. There’s good competition in high-value options, but many phones have had price hikes this year, with base prices going up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many phones that used to win budget awards are now more expensive. So I have to decide what qualifies as best value. We all agree a $1,000 phone shouldn’t win Best Value, right? After much deliberation, I finally landed on what feels like a sweet spot: a phone without standout features but nothing wrong with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "This phone can usually be found for well under $400—the Samsung Galaxy A54. It has everything you need and nothing you don’t. You could go more premium for additional features or go a little cheaper and notice some corner-cutting. But this phone strikes a solid balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s like when someone asks how your day was, and you say, “Oh, it was fine. Nothing remarkable happened.” That’s this phone. Its cameras? Fine. Battery? Fine. Screen? Fine. Design? Fine. Everything is just fine for $400. So for that price, you’ll be just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to give an honorable mention to the Moto G Play, which I reviewed when it came out at $169. I was very impressed with it, considering it’s a decent phone at that price—90 Hz and everything! A shoutout to the Pixel 7a, which went up to $500 this year. It gained a 90 Hz display and better specs, still doing everything you expect from a Pixel, so it deserves recognition for being a good phone at that price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up is Best Battery. This doesn’t necessarily go to the phone with the highest battery capacity; I’m more concerned with the overall battery experience. Ideally, that phone comes with fast charging, wireless charging, or long-lasting convenience. \n",
      "\n",
      "My winner for Best Battery this year is the iPhone 15 Plus. This phone just goes and goes! Its bigger battery, paired with a 60 Hz display, accounts for this amazing battery life. If you want a risk-free, no-brainer for great battery life, this is it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to give a shout-out to the ROG Phone 7. It doesn’t have wireless charging, but it boasts pretty fast charging and the biggest battery capacity of any phone I’ve used this year at 6,000 milliamp hours. If you drop it down to 60 Hz, it too just goes and goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Asus phone, the Zenfone 10, is impressive as well. It’s not the biggest battery, but it effectively manages power, killing background apps and probably omitting some bands in the U.S. Somehow, this small 5.9-inch phone manages amazing battery life; it can easily last two days. Hats off to Asus for producing great battery life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best Design is a tough category, as design is subjective. What I find appealing, others might consider unattractive. It feels like every phone has some flaw that disqualifies it from winning, such as having a huge notch or a plastic frame. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then it hit me—one phone made headlines this year for its design, and I completely agree that it deserves recognition. It’s the Honor Magic V2. This device shifted my perception of phone hardware. It’s under 10 millimeters thick when closed, which is the same thickness as many standard phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has a full-sized screen on the outside and a corner-to-corner foldable display on the inside. Astoundingly, it houses a 5,000 milliamp battery, the largest I’ve seen in any foldable. With 60 plus watt charging, a triple camera setup, and a terabyte of internal storage, this phone showcases what’s possible in a foldable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if the rest of the phone might have some questionable aspects, the design is universally impressive. Everyone I’ve shown it to has been impressed. This brings us to our first new category in a long time at the Smartphone Awards: Best Foldable Phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "This year, I’m genuinely separating and considering all the folding phones released. There’s now a large variety of shapes, sizes, and versions in the foldable and flippable phone market. \n",
      "\n",
      "While folding phones are on the doorstep to mainstream adoption, they’re still mostly thicker and more expensive than traditional phones. I want to recognize those pushing the boundaries toward that revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The winner for Best Foldable Phone in 2023 is the OnePlus Open. This is a fantastic device! When I thought about what folding phone I’d genuinely want to use daily, this one stood out. When it’s closed, it feels most like a normal phone, thanks to its relatively standard screen size and flat sides. When you open it up, you get a nearly eight-inch, almost perfectly square folding screen with a minimal crease. \n",
      "\n",
      "The specs and software are excellent, and it offers many fun features. My favorite aspect is the way you can manage multiple windows visually, allowing them to extend beyond the edge of the screen. It provides a unique, effective way of multitasking on a phone, and that’s incredibly useful. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s undoubtedly the best folding phone released in 2023. I also want to give an honorable mention to the Pixel Fold. Particularly, I find this phone is my favorite to use when it’s closed because its external screen is so good. \n",
      "\n",
      "That outside screen is compact, reachable, and extremely practical, and I love that about it. I’m going to provide an honorable mention to Samsung’s Z Flip 5, which feels like it’s leading the pack for flipping phones. I think it’s better than the Razr and many other flip models.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as build quality and quality control, Samsung is at the top of the heap. Most other folding phones have had quality control issues, yet Samsung, despite earlier complications, has ironed those out over time. That’s their reward for diving in early. I also want to give an honorable mention to the Honor Magic V2 purely for its design—super impressive!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto the Most Improved Award. It's interesting because many phones play it safe with only slight evolutionary changes or spec bumps from last year. I can’t be mad at that if the phone was already good. \n",
      "\n",
      "For me, the Most Improved Phone for 2023 is the Nothing Phone 2. This award is partly based on hardware and partly software improvements. They didn’t change the hardware significantly since the first Nothing Phone, as they were still establishing their identity. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a newer, higher resolution LED pattern on the back and a slightly curved glass for better handling. Overall, it still looks like a Nothing Phone, but the software improvements, especially with Nothing OS 2.0 and then 2.5 on Android 14, are fantastic. \n",
      "\n",
      "They focused on efficiency, smoothness, and adding new features that the original phone doesn’t get, like better glyph controls, clone app features, and monochrome themes. It all adds up to a significant improvement. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a world where most people could easily buy last year’s phone and be satisfied, I can confidently say you should consider the Phone 2 over the Phone 1. However, don’t expect to send blue text bubbles, as that won’t happen. So, Phone 2 is much improved, which is a positive for putting them on the map!\n",
      "\n",
      "An honorable mention goes to the iPhone 15 for its transition to USB Type-C. That’s a pretty big change!\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up: Bust of the Year. This is the award no one wants to give out, but one of these phones on this desk will win Worst New Phone of 2023. I have to preface this by saying it’s genuinely difficult to find a bad phone nowadays. Most phones, regardless of price, are either good for the money or at least okay for the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this year, there was one disappointing phone: the Solama Saga Crypto Phone, which I’m crowning as Bust of the Year. There is no price at which I could recommend anyone purchase this phone. Buying it feels like buying a timeshare—appealing at first but painfully regrettable upon realization.\n",
      "\n",
      "This phone has some redeeming qualities, like decent build quality with ceramic materials and a pleasant heft. However, that quality is wasted on this phone. The backstory made it apparent things wouldn’t go well. I’ll link to the full video I did about it if you want to dive deeper into that disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m also giving an honorable mention to all the concept phones announced this year that never materialized—and likely never will. You know who you are.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve made it to the biggest trophy of the night—the same size as the others, but the most important. It's the MVP, the Most Valuable Phone. This isn’t about monetary value; it’s truly about my favorite phone of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, it comes down to identifying the best phones that impact the industry, those that are the most fun, the most unique and innovative, with the greatest features. This combines all of that into one recognition for the MVP, the Phone of the Year for 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will it be? There have been some fascinating stories, disruptive models, and remarkable phones this year. My winner for MVP, Phone of the Year for 2023, is the Pixel 8. Congratulations to the Pixel 8—it has significantly improved over last year! \n",
      "\n",
      "This phone boasts several differences from its predecessor, but the standout is its $100 price increase over the Pixel 7, so it really has to deliver to be worthy of that. And it does! With a fantastic camera, it may not be miles ahead of previous years but still delivers great photo quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, it has a dramatically improved display at 120 Hz, with a flagship-level brightness of up to 2,000 nits. It’s powered by the same Tensor G3 chip as the Pro model, which costs several hundred dollars more. On top of that, it has an impressive array of software features matching the more expensive Pro model, making it more challenging to justify that higher price tag.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all these perks and promising seven years of software updates, the Pixel 8 represents an incredible well-rounded package for its impact and price, making it a standout phone of the year. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also have a runner-up. I genuinely love this phone, though it might not be the most popular. It’s the Asus Zenfone 10. After last year’s success, this phone does it again in a compact package that’s nearly perfect. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s small and accessible, with surprisingly good cameras, excellent performance, and remarkable battery life. There’s very little to criticize about this phone. The Zenfone 10 is outstanding, and I recommend watching the full review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I want to give an honorable mention to the iPhone 15 Pro. This model feels like the pinnacle of the iPhone experience. While past iterations could have been deemed “peak iPhone,” with its USB Type-C and absence of the notch in favor of the dynamic island, this truly feels like a finalized product. \n",
      "\n",
      "There aren’t many other significant advancements I expect other than potential fingerprint readers or fast charging in future iterations. For now, this is undoubtedly the best iPhone yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two quick mentions go to the ultra-boring S23 Ultra for being a solid, flawless phone. It consistently gets overlooked when considering the best of 2023, despite being a fantastic device. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to give a shout-out to the OnePlus Open, as the foldable phone I’d genuinely recommend to real users. While most people might not spend $1,800 on a foldable phone, if they were to buy one, this would be the phone I’d choose to use daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s it! Those are my Smartphone Awards for 2023. Let me know your thoughts—I can’t wait to see which phones you would have chosen for your awards. Maybe others will create their own lists too, but I’m quite happy with my selections. Until next time, catch you later. Peace! \n",

      "- [Marques] Okay, I got to see something really cool. I visited some of the secret labs inside the Walt Disney Company called the Disney Imagineering Labs. I’ve seen a few people talk about them before, but obviously Disney has all these attractions, theme parks, and rides, and someone has to design and engineer all that. There’s a surprising amount of tech involved, and some of it is still experimental and unreleased, with no one outside of Disney—well, except for me—having had the chance to use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is incredible. Disney Imagineering has several buildings scattered around a California neighborhood that I got to visit, where they create realistic animatronic robots for their attractions. They literally greeted me at the door with these little droids, the same ones roaming around the theme parks. These droids share striking similarities with the Boston Dynamics Spot robot I got to play with a few years ago. The Spot robot can navigate any terrain with an adaptive gait and follows instructions from a custom, surprisingly easy-to-learn controller, allowing it to perform tasks that humans can’t. It’s also super fun to play with.\n",
      "\n",
      "These little droids for the theme parks work similarly. They adapt to any terrain, walk around, and follow instructions from a customized Steam Deck as a controller, which I learned to use in under a minute. They can interact with guests at the theme park and are enjoyable to play with. It’s really impressive how much tech is packed into these devices. They blend animations from walking to standing and looking around, which is pretty amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that’s not even why I was there. I was specifically there to be the first person outside of Disney to walk on the HoloTile. You might have seen some videos about this before. The HoloTile is this insane, one-of-a-kind, 360-degree treadmill, essentially a moving floor. It’s still in the experimental phase, and there’s only one in existence, but it’s already got my mind racing with potential applications, especially in VR. There’s actually one specific concern I have, but I’ll get to that in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I don’t think anyone has fully explained how this thing works yet, but they’ve essentially built a huge number of tiny, one-inch discs that spin on top of their bases, functioning like miniature treadmills that adjust direction according to how you are walking. A normal treadmill only moves in one direction on a flat plane, helping you know exactly where you’re going. But if you want to create a treadmill that can respond and move in any direction, a traditional flat treadmill wouldn’t work well; it would need to spin quickly to match your walking direction, which is a bit crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, they incorporated a bunch of articulating cones with discs on top of them, with motors inside to spin those discs. Here’s the key: the discs are tilted, so only the edge of the disc in the air touches the floor. It’s less of a flat treadmill and more like a series of small blades rotating beneath your feet. When you walk forward, they spin clockwise to move your foot back to the middle, and when you walk backward, they spin counterclockwise to do the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve seen videos that Disney has released of a person walking on it, but I had to start small. I’ve never walked on it before, and it can do a lot of things. So, let's take it step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three ways to control the HoloTile: by walking on it, using a controller like a PlayStation 5 controller, and just straight-up using your hands to point at it. Let’s start with hands. First, we placed an apple box on the HoloTile. There’s a screen overhead that shows real-time inputs and what the sensors are detecting, both on the floor and around it. They’ve mapped anything crossing a certain line in front of me to move whatever object is on the floor. So when I move my hand in front of that line, the program adjusts the floor to match my hand's movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is pretty amazing! I assume everyone watching has seen Star Wars and can appreciate how cool it would be to have something like this in a Star Wars-themed attraction at a park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the first time I actually stepped onto the HoloTile was while sitting in a chair, using a PlayStation controller. So I was in a chair placed on a flat wooden base, and they handed me the controller. Here’s how that went.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Speaker] 3, 2, 1, enable. \n",
      "(tiles rustling)\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Marques] The left joystick controlled my position, and the right joystick controlled rotation. You could move around freely and adapt quickly. And yes, I was able to steer myself off the floor entirely; I was just cautious about not flinging myself off the edge. It moves fast!\n",
      "\n",
      "(tiles rustling)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that I've experienced the controls, it was time to walk on the HoloTile.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Marques] I’m going to start with training mode, which operates at a fraction of normal speed, allowing me to get accustomed to how it works. I’m ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Speaker] 3, 2, 1, enable.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Marques] Training mode is on. I slowly began to walk. I could feel the tiles moving slightly but not too quickly yet. As I walked a little faster and took longer strides, I grew used to the tiles' responsiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The design intended this to be a two-minute process where these tiny tiles gradually sped up their responsiveness to my movements, eventually reaching nearly real-time speed. There’s definitely a learning curve, but I felt comfortable enough to walk without overthinking it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I walked, I noticed a few things. First, it was pretty loud, which Disney will need to address if this is ever part of a theme park or even someone’s home. Also, I found it fascinating that I was never really walking in a perfectly straight line. It might feel straight if my foot aligned with a row of discs, but other times, I glided over the tops of ridges without moving directly forward. I can imagine a future version of this will feature many smaller, more numerous discs that are just as powerful—though that’s clearly an engineering challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent time with the inventor of the HoloTile, Lanny Smoot, who’s been at Disney for over 20 years and holds more than 70 patents, including the mechanism for how BB-8 rolls around the park and the technology behind real-life lightsabers. He’s quite the legend! \n",
      "\n",
      "Lanny demonstrated that two people can use the HoloTile simultaneously while playing a multiplayer racing game, controlling a BB-8 around a course by jogging. It worked well, even though it felt a bit small. It would be even better with more of these floor tiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I found most fascinating was using the HoloTile with a VR headset on. This is what you’d expect for VR, right? I’ve seen other 360-degree treadmill setups before, and while they function, they often struggle to eliminate the disconnect between what your eyes perceive and what your body feels. \n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, if you look at your phone in a moving car, your eyes see a stationary screen, but your brain feels you moving forward. This disconnect can lead to motion sickness. The same applies to the moving treadmill in VR. You put on a headset and start walking, seeing yourself advance through a moving environment, but because you’re walking in place, your brain doesn’t recognize that you should be moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with the HoloTile, I put on an Apple Vision Pro and walked through a 3D constructed environment. I felt like I was in a holo deck from Star Trek, but I had a harness on because this experience was challenging. My eyes showed movement, but my feet slid around as my brain struggled with the idea that I wasn’t actually moving forward. It was confusing, making it hard to just trust my instincts and walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, I watched Lanny with the headset on, effortlessly walking through space and exploring a virtual world, likely a virtual Disney theme park. It felt like the future—freely exploring a vast space, potentially in the comfort of your home. If this technology continues to develop, it may bring us closer to that possibility one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either way, this is definitely incredible tech. I’m grateful to have seen this initial version, and I’m eager to see what future versions will entail. Disney, please invite me back! I want to see what the future of this technology looks like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, that’s it. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace. \n",

      "- All right, welcome to the definitive iPhone versus Android video. It's the impossible debate, right? In many ways, people get so entrenched on one side that they never want to flip to the other. To each their own—you hear that all the time—but I have a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how we're going to do this. I’m going to break it down into seven meaningful categories. It’s an odd number, so there has to be a winner—no ties. But since we know that one winner doesn’t automatically apply to every human on earth, I'm going to provide you with a system, a rubric, to help determine the real winner for yourself. You'll see what I mean. Let’s get into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Category number one: Customization. If you see an icon and get excited, then you probably love customization too. Digging into the settings, tweaking the home screen and lock screen, and customizing behaviors to make the device perfect for you—it's a hobby all on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first glance in 2023, it might seem like iOS 17 and Android 14 are pretty close. Let’s be real: iOS added some fantastic features, particularly with the new lock screen update, which allows you to change clock fonts and colors, add useful widgets, and save different setups for various situations and focus modes. Plus, widgets were added to the home screen less than two years ago, unlocking a lot of customization possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the more you look into it, the more you realize it’s not actually that close. Apple keeps adding abilities, but you’re always restricted to doing it the Apple way. That’s why many iPhone setups still look quite similar. If you take stock Android 14 from the Google Pixel, which isn’t even the most customizable version of Android, there's still much more you can modify—from theme colors matching your wallpaper thanks to Material You to custom widget sizes. Android offers you the freedom to do whatever you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the iPhone, you can’t expand a widget to any size, place an app where you want on the home screen, or change the grid size or icon sizes easily. It takes a lot of extra effort just to use a custom icon. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, it's worth noting that you can create a truly ugly Android setup, while it’s hard to mess up an iPhone home screen significantly. While you could argue that iOS is prettier, the winner for most customization is Android.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to category number two: Features. It simply comes down to which platform can do more. This has long been a hot topic in iOS versus Android discussions, mostly because both platforms have launched with missing features, particularly the iPhone. You might have heard remarks like, “Can you believe the iPhone can’t even set wallpapers?” or “Is it really just getting copy and paste now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it’s 2023, and both platforms are very complete. They often copy each other’s features. You’ll see a new Android release and think, “That came from iOS,” and vice versa. There are even some new features on the iPhone that Android doesn’t have, like focus modes for fine-tuning notifications in various situations. There are also privacy features like Hide My Email and iCloud Private Relay. Dynamic Island on the Pro iPhone could be viewed as a feature, but it’s limited to a small number of apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, neither OS is missing any massive features. They’ve both matured into their own identities and offer a lot. However, I’m still giving the edge to Android because of the countless little OS-level tweaks—like battery management options, file management systems, gaming modes, independent volume controls, and reverse wireless charging. \n",
      "\n",
      "The variety of features available makes it clear: if you want fast charging, a 10x camera, or USB Type-C, you’ll have to go Android. Winner again? Android.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is category number three: Ease of use. This is important to many people. Ease of use often has an inverse relationship with customization and features. There’s a balancing act between user flexibility and not overwhelming them with options. This is where the iPhone excels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iPhone has kept its fundamental design simple. For instance, the home screen has had four icons in the dock from the beginning, and the phone icon has always been green and to the left. The camera app has generally stayed the same, which hides many settings away in a separate app, making it feel a bit less feature-rich. But, fundamentally, it’s easy for most people to use. \n",

      "While there are downsides, like Siri being mostly neglected, Apple tends to keep things consistent. Any changes, like moving the end call button, seem to spark outrage. Conversely, Android often shifts things around, leading to inconsistent user experiences, which can be frustrating for the average user. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, iPhones tend to have less bloatware, and customer service tends to be better due to the widespread presence of Apple stores. For those who aren't tech enthusiasts and just want a phone that works, they typically opt for the iPhone. Ease of use? Check for the iPhone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we must discuss updates. Category number four: Support. This is somewhat underrated. Many people don’t consider long-term software and security updates when purchasing new phones, but it should be a priority. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the Android world, some manufacturers don’t make solid promises regarding updates. Some offer short-term support, while a few can extend promises to three or four years. Currently, Samsung is the leader in Android software updates; they announced in 2019 that all devices from that year on would receive four years of security updates, with some flagships getting five.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, nothing compares to Apple. When iOS 17 arrives this fall, every iPhone back to the iPhone 10R from 2018 will be supported, giving it five major software updates. I doubt any Android devices from 2018 will receive Android 14 when it launches. So this category easily goes to Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to category number five: Apps. Both platforms have millions of apps now—over 3.5 million in the Google Play Store and over 1.5 million in Apple’s App Store. While this initially seems like a win for Android due to quantity, it’s really about quality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Every major app is available on both platforms, meaning there’s a plethora of niche apps in the Google Play Store. However, many developers prioritize iOS for updates simply for efficiency. Updating one version for all iPhones means faster releases as they all have similar specs. On Android, the vast number of devices complicates this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having a plethora of titles is one thing, but is it the same Instagram app or Threads app on both platforms? Having used apps on both systems, I can confidently say updates often come to iPhone users first, even for some of Google’s own apps. So, the slight advantage here goes to the iPhone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now onto category six: Excitement. This one’s more subjective but still relevant. Personally, I get excited about various new tech innovations. With only one or two iPhone releases per year, it’s easy to build hype for the new iPhone. However, Android offers a constant stream of innovations and releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re interested in folding phones, there are more Android options than ever. Want a gaming phone, a headphone jack, or the fastest charging? That’s the world of Android! With each iPhone launch, excitement often revolves around whether it will finally catch up to features that Android has had for years—like USB-C.\n",
      "\n",
      "For novelty alone, the excitement category definitely goes to Android.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we come to category seven: Ecosystem. There are many who won’t buy a phone if it doesn’t have iMessage or FaceTime. Apple has built a robust ecosystem, but they’re not the only ones. Samsung has a variety of devices that create its own ecosystem, such as the Galaxy S flagship, Galaxy Buds, Galaxy Watch, and Galaxy Tab.\n",
      "\n",
      "On paper, Samsung’s ecosystem is surprisingly congruent. Unified USB-C charging across devices and a wide array of device options provide flexibility. Yet Apple’s ecosystem stands out for its seamlessness and ease of use, with features like Continuity Camera working remarkably well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The popularity of the Apple ecosystem—especially in the U.S.—makes its services like FaceTime and iMessage incredibly strong. Both ecosystems are solid, but at this moment, I’m giving the slight edge to Apple for its integration and continuity features.\n",
      "\n",
      "After tallying up all the categories, you can see the iPhone is the objective winner in four out of the seven categories. But hold your pitchforks! There is no one-size-fits-all winner here, especially when options are this close. \n",
      "\n",
      "And if you’ve been watching my videos, you know I primarily use an Android phone alongside my iPhone. Picking one ultimate winner suggests that it’s best for everyone, but we know different features matter to different people. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve devised a basic system to help you find your personal winner. Just order the seven categories by importance to you and rate each from one to five based on how much you care about them. For me, customization and features matter most, followed by apps and excitement. Ease of use and ecosystem are less critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "By assessing the points earned in each category, my clear winner is Android. But for you, if you value ecosystem more than anything else, the iPhone might be the perfect fit. Phone selection is deeply personal, much like buying a car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, purchasing a phone is one of the most personal decisions you'll make. It’s a purchase you carry everywhere, so it's natural for people to be passionate about their choices. At the end of the day, the winner is us, the consumers, because both platforms are competing to improve and win you over. That’s the way it should be.\n",

      "This brand new smartphone from 2023 has a 6.5-inch, 90 hertz display featuring a hole-punch cutout, a 5,000 milliamp-hour battery, triple cameras, a micro SD card slot for expandable storage, a headphone jack, and water resistance, all for $169. Nice, but what’s the catch? There’s got to be a catch, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "I've said it before, and I'll say it again: good phones are getting cheap, and cheap phones are getting good. This video will focus on the second part of that, which is the cheap phones that are getting so good. This phone recently hit my inbox. It’s called the Moto G Play for 2023, and if you’ve been paying attention, Motorola has been making a lot of really good budget phones over the past couple of years. I wanted to personally find out how you can end up with a phone that’s a tenth the price of the ones I've been really enjoying.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the outside, it’s a pretty big phone, which I like. It features a 6.5-inch flat 90 hertz LCD display. It’s not the best-looking screen you’ve ever seen; it’s only 720p, so I can literally see pixels sometimes. It doesn’t get very bright, and the viewing angles are pretty poor if you get off axis. The bezels are slightly thicker, especially at the chin, and there’s a bit of light fall-off around the hole-punch camera at the top. But can you really pixel peep at this price? This is plenty of screen for texting, web browsing, navigation, flipping through apps, and scrolling through social media—the classic stuff you want to do on a phone. Mission accomplished. It’s a big screen, so that’s not the catch.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the build, you may have noticed that it’s made of plastic. However, the layout is perfectly fine. You have the port and speakers at the bottom, a headphone jack at the top, and expandable storage alongside the SIM card tray right where it belongs. On the back, there’s a decently-fast fingerprint reader located in that classic Motorola dimple spot. The layout is well-designed, and it absolutely does not bend or creak. Plus, you might have heard that plastic is not the end of the world when it comes to smartphone builds. While premium phones feel heavier and more premium with glass, plastic can often be more durable if you drop it. Some people also prefer a lighter-weight phone when it’s this big. Additionally, it is still water resistant. I can't say it's waterproof; it’s IP52, but it is water resistant. So, the build—that’s not the catch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, what about the battery? You might be wondering. The battery is excellent—perfectly unironically so. It’s a 5,000 milliamp-hour battery powering a phone with a 720p display, which means you’re good for a day and a half easily. Two light days is no problem with seven hours of screen-on time. It only supports up to 10-watt charging, which is pretty slow, and there is no wireless charging, but I won’t consider that a drawback at this price. You can just charge it overnight like a normal person, and battery life will be fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the software is really good. It provides a nearly identical experience to their $1,000 flagship Edge phone, which means near stock Android with some extra Motorola features sprinkled on top. At its core, it feels similar to a Pixel when you dig through quick settings, notifications, and the launcher. You'll also find some Motorola widgets tucked in, a few extra settings in the settings app, and the Moto app that lets you access extra gestures and features they’ve perfected over the years. These include the double chop for the flashlight, three-finger screenshot, peek display for notifications, and swiping down on the notification panel from the fingerprint reader on the back. The only feature not included might be the double twist to quickly open the camera, probably because the camera is not one of the highlights of these low-cost phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the camera, it’s functional, which is what you would hope for at this price. While I’m not a huge fan of the triple camera layout—because they’re trying to look premium—the top one is a 2-megapixel macro camera and the bottom one is a 2-megapixel depth camera for portrait mode. I mainly want the 16-megapixel main camera to capture scenes and documents, take photos and videos without issues, and it does function well, especially in good lighting. It won’t win any comparison tests, that’s for sure, but we ask a lot of our phones. The fact that this $169 gadget can make phone calls, send text messages, navigate you, play games, browse the web, and take decent pictures and 1080p videos is solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially, I was skeptical about whether it would utilize the depth camera for portrait-mode shots, but it did notify me when I covered it while trying to take a photo. This shows that it’s paying attention. However, when I took the photo and adjusted the background blur, the cutout shape looked truly bizarre. It’s really bad—one of the worst I’ve ever seen. They really just said, \"Yeah, we’ll save a bit of processing power here.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "But that is the catch. It’s not the build quality—that’s fine. It’s certainly not the battery life—that's great. It’s not the cameras, nor is it the software. The catch is that this phone is slow—really slow. This phone has a MediaTek Helio G37 chip with three gigabytes of RAM. Other phones with this chipset include the Techno Spark 9, the Infinix Hot 12, and the HONOR X7a, all retailing for well under $150. So clearly, it’s a cheap chip, which is how it ended up in this phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "For context, the Geekbench score of the iPhone 14 is considerably higher than that of the Moto G Play. When I say it’s trying to save processing power by not performing detailed portrait cutouts, I actually mean it—it lacks any meaningful processing power. I’m not nitpicking to say it’s slow only with high-end games; this phone is slow all the time. It’s slow to scroll and navigate the UI. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, remember I mentioned that this phone has a variable 90 hertz display? I’ll be honest—it would have taken me a while to tell because it is almost never anywhere near 60 hertz. It constantly hangs and stutters, and it’s slow to unlock and open apps—even normal ones. The settings app takes an embarrassingly long time to open and search through. Some of this could be attributed to storage speed, to be fair, but the point is, this is the catch. This phone is slower than average to take pictures, slow to type or browse, and high-end gaming or photo editing is practically out of the question. It might be the slowest phone I’ve ever used, which can make it quite unpleasant to operate.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I used this phone longer, I found myself pondering a big question: is it better to get a new cheap phone like this or an older, once-expensive flagship? For instance, this phone is $169 brand new, while this OnePlus 7 Pro—one of my all-time favorites—was the phone of the year in 2019 and retailed for $669. Now, you can easily find it for well under $200 secondhand. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we compare dollar for dollar with the Moto, the OnePlus 7 Pro provides a much better experience across the board. Even though the Snapdragon 855 is a few years old, it’s far more capable and part of a smoother overall performance profile with faster storage and more RAM. It features a much nicer OLED screen, which is sharper, brighter, and actually achieves the 90 hertz refresh rate consistently. It also has more built-in storage, although it’s not expandable, and a better camera setup—primary, ultra-wide, and zoom. The OnePlus is built from glass, which feels solid, and it offers a 4,000 milliamp-hour battery, perhaps the only hardware feature where you could call it a draw or a slight win for the Moto.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can't forget that OnePlus was famous for its warp charging, as this older flagship can do 30 watts of wired charging. It’s becoming pretty clear that the old flagship is better. However, one distinct advantage of the budget phone is that, being new, it will likely receive software updates further into the future than the old phone. This is theoretical, of course—Motorola does not have the best track record with this—but it’s worth mentioning. For example, the Samsung A14 5G has a similar spec sheet and price point, and it will probably receive more software updates than the Moto. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even if a flagship phone is promised three to four years of updates and the budget phone gets only two, once the flagship phone is more than about three years old, its advantage diminishes. The OnePlus 7 Pro is probably done with software updates while the Moto may still have a few left. It's amusing how people view software updates. Some people don’t think about them at all or even avoid them, which I wouldn’t recommend; security patches are essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, this is one point that leans toward the new phone. Additionally, the final aspect in favor of the older phone is environmental impact. Purchasing an older model that’s built to last and getting an extra 2, 3, or 4 years out of it is better for the environment overall. It results in less e-waste, so that’s a strong argument for the older device.\n",
      "\n",
      "My general thought after examining the landscape of old flagships versus new budget phones is that the lower the price of the phone, the more inclined I would be to recommend the older model. For instance, at $169 based on my experience with this phone, I would definitely prefer the older flagship. There are plenty of good flagship models available for around $200, including this one and the Pixel 5. Secondhand options are quite good.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you go up to about $400, it becomes slightly more debatable. Certain factors might still point me toward the older flagship, but around $600, there are some excellent brand-new options that I would prefer while also enjoying the benefits of software updates. There’s not much better than the Pixel 7 right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that’s the theory.\n",
      "(Brass fanfare blaring)\n",

      "- All right, so I've been using the new M4 iPad Pro for about two weeks now. I've been doing a lot of the same things I did with my M1 iPad Pro from three years ago: watching YouTube videos, browsing the internet, answering emails, and listening to music. Spoiler alert: it’s almost exactly the same experience. The M1 iPad Pro was already super powerful, smooth, and snappy, with great battery life. This one is even better in all the same areas. Not the most helpful review, I know, but I've also been thinking about some of the interesting decisions Apple made with this iPad, particularly things that weren’t really in the rumor mill and didn’t even show up in the keynote but are unusual and different. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, here are five of the most interesting choices Apple made with the iPad Pro.  \n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, the new iPad Pro is thinner. We all knew that. It was an interesting choice since I felt like we were done with that a few iterations ago. Nobody was really asking for thinner iPads, but maybe they noticed all the praise for Samsung's Galaxy Tab Ultra, which is also ridiculously thin. The previous iPad was 6.4 mm—slightly thicker than Samsung’s flagship—and now it’s down to 5.1 mm, just barely beating Samsung’s number. I’m not trying to start any unnecessary competition here; if you ask Apple, they’d probably say, \"Look, it’s the thinnest Apple product ever,\" which is already impressive. It really feels like Apple is just looking for something to differentiate this model from the last couple of generations of iPads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now there are rumors they may also be pursuing thinness with next year’s iPhone. Honestly, it feels noticeably thinner and lighter to me, especially as someone who has held the previous one quite a bit. There’s definitely less of a difference with a case on it, but this design naturally means there’s less room inside. Interestingly, the 11\" iPad Pro M4 has a larger battery than the last-generation 11\" iPad Pro, while the new, larger 13\" has a slightly smaller battery—almost the same size as last year’s. So, you end up with really good battery life again, excellent standby time, and solid performance when you’re using it. Apple could have created an iPad with an enormous battery life if they kept the thickness the same as last year, utilizing the efficiency of the M4 chip for insane battery longevity. Instead, they made it strikingly thin while maintaining the same reliable battery life as always. Personally, I would have preferred option one. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few other things missing from this tablet as well. They avoided mentioning it during the keynote, but they got rid of the ultra-wide camera. It’s not a huge deal—obviously. The camera square looks like it could support multiple cameras due to the big cutout for the LiDAR, but it’s just a single camera, LiDAR, and a flash. I was curious if magnet paper could reveal anything new about the iPad. Before JerryRigEverything tore it apart, I thought that if you make something thinner and smaller, the speakers would suffer, right? They would have to be smaller. Magnet paper is a fun way to see both the magnets inside and that the iPad Pro has new, more circular quad speaker drivers, as opposed to the more rectangular-looking ones from before. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve listened to both versions back to back, and this one is a little less bass-heavy, but it remains loud and features some of the best speakers in any tablet. It’s very usable, but with less internal room, the physics result in a slightly less bass-heavy output from the new speakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in terms of packaging, not much has changed. I mean, an iPad box is still just an iPad box, but there are two notable points: one, no more stickers. Sorry, Apple fans, if you were hoping to keep collecting those. They’re focusing on environmental issues, cutting back on plastic, and trying to avoid shipping excess materials. But they still include a few things with every iPad. If you get a Space Grey iPad, you’ll receive a black USB-C cable, as well as a 20-watt charging brick. Okay, fine, but it’s this white charging brick. I know they stopped including the brick with iPhones and could have done the same with the iPad, but they chose to keep shipping a brick. And with a $1,500, $2,000, or even $2,500 iPad, could it at least be a decent brick that supports the fastest charging the iPad can handle? Perhaps even match the color of the cable? But maybe that’s just nitpicking—it probably is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s talk about this computer aspect. The criticism aimed at the iPad Pro over the years has been that it’s a ridiculously overpowered device, but it’s still just an iPad. It effectively does the same things as an iPad Air. Sure, there are a few added features, like Pencil hover, but overall, it remains fundamentally the same. Apple isn’t letting the iPad Pro become a full-fledged computer because it has Macs to protect. So, it remains an overpowered iPad. \n",
      "\n",
      "This generation continues that trend. While it’s true that Apple is unveiling the new M4 chip here first, it’s even more powerful at its peak. It benchmarks extremely well, utilizing a second-generation 3-nanometer process, and has a larger, more powerful neural engine. This chip is fantastic, but as for software that actually takes advantage of that power, the list is very short. Some of the features, like the new Final Cut app, are set to arrive later this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re doing standard iPad activities—watching Netflix, web browsing, all the classics—you’ll feel exactly the same experience, not just compared to the last M1 iPad Pro, but also to an M1 iPad Air. With the M4 version, you can play one of the few games that support the new hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and you can use the new Stem Splitter feature in the Logic Pro 2 app for iPad, which looks fantastic for Logic users. However, the most intriguing new feature about the M4, something they didn’t elaborate on, is how Apple has restructured its pricing model.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, when buying an iPad, the only upgrade was mainly storage, starting at a somewhat inadequate 128 GB, then increasing in price for larger storage variants. A few years ago, we realized that purchasing more storage also meant getting more RAM—but now this latest model escalates that stratification further. Now, you not only get storage but also a different number of CPU cores. The base iPad Pro is now 256 GB, and there’s a transition from an 8-core to a 9-core CPU with the M4 chip, but only in the base models. The top two versions come with an extra performance core, giving those models 10-core CPUs. Additionally, there’s a nano-texture display available only on the high-end options, which I briefly tested at the event. Although I have durability concerns, the anti-reflective finish is impressive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if you’re purchasing a more expensive iPad Pro, you’re getting varying amounts of RAM, CPU cores, storage options, and display types—very computer-like, if you ask me. To me, though, the Tandem OLED display is the most exciting new development for the iPad Pro. In practice, it’s just a brighter, more contrasted version of the display we’ve had for years. Unfortunately, even with an updated OLED display, you won’t notice much difference while watching regular SDR content or doing standard tasks unless you are in direct sunlight at maximum brightness. This speaks to how good the iPad Pro displays have been for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "For artists, there’s also the new Pencil. No, the back still doesn’t act as an eraser, which I wish they would implement, but the rest of the Pencil is better than ever. It now supports Find My, has a new squeeze sensor for selecting tools, and includes a haptic motor for a little click when you squeeze, offering nice confirmation. Surprisingly, they didn’t add this feature sooner. Additionally, the Pencil supports barrel rotation, providing some tools that change with rotation. Furthermore, there’s a fake shadow displayed that follows the tool you’re using in real-time, depending on rotation—quite the extravagant feature. \n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of just naming it the updated Apple Pencil, they continue to sell the old version at the same price and are now calling the new one the Pencil Pro. I’m not an artist and am outside the target demographic for this product, but if these new features appeal to you, you’ll need to buy a new iPad to enjoy them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "(dramatic suspicious music)  \n",
      "That decision was intentional, as they moved the camera to the landscape side of the iPad, which is a great choice. That’s where we always wanted it, and it houses the Face ID components. There’s also an ultra-wide camera for FaceTime, but that’s also where the Pencil has always magnetized and charged. They had to rearrange the internal components to accommodate both. The Pencil still snaps onto the top, but I wonder if it was necessary to arrange them this way. Couldn’t they have placed the Pencil on the iPad’s top or maybe offset it so that the Pencil is on one side and the camera on the other? Instead, they have it in the middle, as always. I used magnet paper to check the back, which confirmed that they changed the magnet layout inside. I tried pairing the new Pencil Pro with my old iPad Pro, and while it stuck a bit, it didn’t fully connect. Convenient, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I’m not personally interested in buying one of the new M4 iPad Pros because I already have a relatively new M1 iPad, so I don’t need an upgrade. However, if you don’t have a recent iPad, this new version is fantastic and better than ever. But we’re surely all waiting for WWDC later this year to see what new features iPadOS will offer that this new model can support—anything truly interesting that we don’t already know about. Beyond that, it’s somewhat of the same story as the last few generations of the iPad Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of thinness, though, have you checked out dbrand iPad skins? Fun fact: you’d need to stack up 22 of dbrand’s iPad skins to match the thickness of the iPad itself. Trust me, I’ve tried—it’s exactly 22. Anyway, dbrand has been creating the best leather skins in the business for a while now, which is great since Apple isn’t really producing anything leather anymore. Their skins are high-quality soft leather, not some sanded-down fake texture. It’s all-natural, full-grain leather that feels plush and will develop a nice patina over time since you can have these iPads for years. If you want to check out premium leather accessories for your iPad, look at our channel sponsor, dbrand. The link is in the description.\n",

      "And today, Samsung had their expected summer Unpacked event in July, where they announced two new phones and three new wearable devices. Well, it’s more than that if you count the small and large sizes, but there was a lot of stuff. I got to go hands-on with all of it, so here are my first impressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to start with the two new phones. This was the reveal of the latest foldables: the Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6. In general, these phones are very much still minor iterations on last year's models. Shocker. I was thinking about that; it kind of feels dismissive to say, \"Oh, Samsung settled; they're not really changing anything.\" While that’s somewhat true, these are still phones at the forefront of two of the most advanced areas in tech: foldables and AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the Fold 6, the larger model, looks just like the Fold 5. They’ve squared up the sides a bit, changed the camera housing slightly, and given it thinner bezels both inside and outside, making the cover screen a little more usable. Now both screens reach up to 2,600 nits of brightness. It’s powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, with a few new colors added, and that's about it. There are a couple of even smaller upgrades, like a slightly better hinge and a new ultra-wide camera. The squared sides provide a bit more interior volume, which allows for a 60% larger vapor chamber for better cooling, but aside from that, it has the same battery size, the same general form factor, the same under-screen camera on the inside—just a lot of the same stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the real focus for this phone, and for the others, of course, is this new AI, the Galaxy AI they're pushing to the forefront. Similar to what Apple did a couple of months ago, they're trying to surface all the AI features they’ve been working on, bringing new capabilities to the top so that regular users can actually utilize them. They've branded it as Galaxy AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in the settings app, right at the top, there’s a new Galaxy AI section filled with the latest features. Some of these are genuinely useful; others maybe not so much. For instance, Call assist can definitely be useful. The interpreter feature allows you to have back-and-forth conversations in different languages—that’s cool. Note assist helps summarize content in the Notes app, and Transcript assist will summarize voice notes. These features are pretty standard and have been seen before.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you use Samsung’s browser instead of Chrome for some reason, you can hit that stars AI button to summarize any webpage with a lot of text. We've seen that before as well. The generative fill feature allows you to get extra information from a photo you’ve taken, and while it's not new, it’s now available in Samsung’s Gallery app. If you want to create a wider angle photo or straighten a horizon, it does a surprisingly good job at filling in the corners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there’s Drawing assist, which can take something you sketch in Notes—even if you’re not the best artist like me—and generate art in various styles. It looks very similar to what Apple’s Image Playgrounds app does. The watercolor style is quite tame, but there’s also a 3D cartoon style that, if given some time, is honestly pretty impressive. I don’t know if it’s good art, but there’s definitely quite a lot you can create with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the Z Flip 6, it shares a lot of the same updates as the Z Fold 6: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, squared sides, and a slightly refreshed design. Spec-wise, it aligns with the base S24, featuring the same camera setup with a 50-megapixel main camera and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide. The battery has increased from 3,700 to 4,000 mAh, which is promising, and the inside screen also hits 2,600 nits. There’s a wider variety of widgets for the outer screen, enhancing its usability, and for the first time, the Flip includes a vapor chamber and a base of 12 GB of RAM. It also sports new colored metal rings around the cameras for easy visual identification of the new model.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we’ll have to see if these phones and their folding screens age better than the previous generation. A slightly better hinge might help, but, as far as I can tell, they seem to have the same crease level and hinge feel, making them overall very similar to last year’s hardware package. The icing on the cake, though, is that these phones are both $100 more than last year. The Z Flip 6 will retail for $1,099 instead of $1,000, and the Fold will be $1,899 instead of $1,799. So, that’s the trend they’re following.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there’s the wearable tech they announced, which I think people might find even more interesting than the phone updates. This includes two new watches, two new earbuds, and a smart ring. The Galaxy Watch 7 receives a nice refresh, looking very familiar and starting at $299 for the 40 mm model. They've also introduced a new Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra in this lineup, which we had been expecting. This model features a titanium body, sapphire crystal display, and maintains the 1.5-inch circular display size of the 44 mm, but with a beefier body to accommodate a 590 mAh battery. It’s water-resistant up to 100 meters and includes a new watch face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Watch 7 and Ultra both come with dual-frequency GPS. Notably, the Ultra features a large orange button known as the Quick Button, which can be customized to start various activities or workouts. It’s clear this product targets the Apple Watch Ultra, and the pricing reflects that; it comes in at $650 compared to Apple’s $800.\n",
      "\n",
      "My question is how they stack up head-to-head. Battery-wise, the Ultra may actually outperform the Apple Watch, claiming around 100 hours in power-saving mode. In terms of accuracy and features, we’ll have to wait and see. Samsung is also introducing a new concept that compiles all your health metrics into a single score—an Energy Score—using AI, which I’m keen to try out. \n",
      "\n",
      "They also announced the new Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 2 Pro, which have clear counterparts in other ecosystems but bring new cases and designs. People are saying they resemble the first-generation AirPods aesthetically, which is somewhat true, especially at the top. The Pro version has long stems fitted with blade lights to indicate different modes or statuses, which is a neat feature. The Pros are better than the regular buds, boasting features like Ambient mode, soft tips, and adaptive noise cancellation that adjusts based on your environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Buds 3 are priced at $179 and the Buds Pro at $249. Last but not least, they unveiled the smart ring that had been teased months ago. It’s a 24/7 fitness tracker that you can wear all day, including when you sleep or swim—a device you’ll always have on you. I’ve never tested a smart ring before, so I’ll be curious to see how this one compares, especially against the Oura Ring, which is the industry standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Samsung ring looks like other smart rings, featuring a minimal exterior with a slightly concave design to avoid scratches. It comes in three finishes—matte black, silver, or gold—and measures seven mm in width and 2.6 mm in thickness. The sensors are all located inside, measuring heart rate, skin temperature, and more. It’s also water-resistant up to 100 meters and boasts a battery life of about seven days, depending on size. When it runs low, you can place it in a clever charging case that lights up around the ring to show charging status. This case can provide roughly 1.5 times the total life of the ring before needing a recharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price for the ring will be $399, which is $100 more than the basic Oura Ring, but this one does not require a subscription. The Oura typically charges around $6 a month, which adds up over time. With Samsung, you pay $399 upfront and receive all the features without any additional costs, but you’ll need a Samsung Galaxy phone and the Samsung Health app to use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I’m glad to see some competition without a subscription model. And that wraps up what Samsung announced today: two new phones, two new earbuds, two new watches, and the smart ring—all set to hit shelves soon and priced quite premiumly. Wow, that was an unintended alliteration! But yes, all this stuff is coming out shortly. Before you go, what if I told you this phone could be worth $1 million? It’s not, but let me explain what our channel sponsor, dbrand, has going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is their latest drop called Case Hardened. If you’ve ever played \"Counter-Strike,\" you’ll be familiar with the in-game economy for Case Hardened skins. Just last month, an AK-47 sold for over $1 million—actual dollars. This ultra-rare Blue Gem skin is about one in 21 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know real \"Counter-Strike\" fans might point out that dbrand’s Case Hardened isn’t entirely random and that no real Blue Gems exist, but here’s the twist: like in the game, dbrand created thousands of Case Hardened patterns, some of which are actual random Blue Gems. It won't be quite one in 21 million, but they look fantastic. Both designs have a metallic sheen, making the back of your phone visually interesting instead of just the front. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll leave a link in the description below if you want to check it out and upgrade your device. Samsung doesn’t typically go bold with colors. So, yeah, that’s it! Let me know what you think of these new devices and wearables and which ones you’d like to see reviews of first. Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you on the next one. Peace.  \n",

      "- All right, welcome to the Smartphone Awards 2022. It's one of my favorite videos, and y'all knew it was coming. It's a bit of a tradition around here to revisit the smartphones that came out during the calendar year 2022, where I recognize and reward some of the best, the worst, and some interesting developments that happened throughout the year. There's usually a lot to cover, and we often forget about various releases, but this is one of my favorite videos to make. We even have, of course, no spoilers, but we’ve got some trophies for the winners; they're super nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "From flagships to midrange phones, budget options, specialty phones, and folding devices, I got to use them all. I have my own opinions about each, and some of you may agree with my awards, while others may disagree. One thing is for sure: these awards are mine. So, without any further ado, let's start handing them out!\n",
      "\n",
      "The first category is Best Big Phone. If you look at this table, it's clear that phones have gotten bigger over time, to the point where pretty much every phone is considered big. However, I still want to reward a phone that makes great use of that space, as you desire a large screen, a big battery, maybe large speakers, good cameras, and an overall thoughtful use of that extra room.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my winner for Best Big Phone of the year, which actually came out near the beginning of the year, is Samsung's Galaxy S22 Ultra. \n",
      "\n",
      "(gentle music)\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of hardware, this device pretty much does it all. It has a big 6.8-inch display, one of the best in the business, and it added a stylus while still including a 5,000 mAh battery, which is the same capacity as the previous year. It features multiple high-quality cameras on the back, a pair of excellent telephotos, good speakers, good software, and really no hardware flaws to speak of. You might even say it was kind of boring, which I think is a good thing because if you're spending this much on a phone, you don't want anything to seem too unusual. This phone, in a way, returns to the functionality that the Notes usually provided in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also like to give runner-ups and honorable mentions in these categories. So for Best Big Phone, the runner-up is the ASUS ROG Phone 6. It's actually quite similar to Samsung's flagship but lacks a few features. It's a bit more specialized—no wireless charging—but it has a screen on the back and is much more gaming-centric. I must shout out its incredible massive stereo front-facing speakers and the headphone jack. Big phones should include space for a headphone jack!\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d also like to give an honorable mention to the Xiaomi Mix Fold 2. It didn’t have an IP rating and wasn’t widely available, but it represents a breakthrough in folding phones as it folds to about the same thickness as a normal phone. This marks a significant moment in the development of folding devices, making them feel closer to everyday usability—big phone, smaller package.\n",
      "\n",
      "(phone clicking)\n",
      "\n",
      "Next category: Best Small Phone. Here, we're on the other end of the spectrum—there aren't many small phones available, making this a rare category. To be honest, this wasn’t a tough decision. Last year’s winner, the iPhone Mini, was discontinued, so it wouldn't even qualify. Thus, Best Small Phone of the Year goes to the ASUS Zenfone 9. This phone is so nice!\n",
      "\n",
      "(gentle music)\n",
      "\n",
      "They made many great decisions across the board. It's small—relative to other phones—with a 5.9-inch display, flagship specs like the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 1080p higher refresh rate OLED, great software, tons of RAM, and incredibly fast performance. What surprised me the most was the camera quality. If a phone this small can have a headphone jack, then what’s everyone else's excuse?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some weird flaws, like the soft touch back that discolors easily, but I was genuinely surprised by the battery life on this phone. There aren’t many things that genuinely surprise me in the smartphone world anymore, but this device's small size combined with excellent battery life makes it easily the best smartphone in this size category.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do have a runner-up for this category, which is the Oppo Find N2. This compact, passport-sized phone has flat edges and still features a solid folding display inside. I haven't done a full review on it yet, but it feels like a sneak peek at what a folding Pixel might look like, which is intriguing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let’s move on to the next category: Best Camera, or better yet, Best Camera System across the board. A good camera involves photo quality, video quality, capture speed, autofocus reliability, ease of use, and file formats, among other factors. \n",
      "\n",
      "This year, we conducted an interesting blind smartphone camera test on a website we created, allowing people to vote on their favorite photos across three different categories. We had 16 different phones competing, and surprisingly, the overall winner was the Pixel 6A, with the Pixel 7 coming in as the runner-up. These are clearly great cameras, but I'm not awarding them the trophy for the best camera system.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m also not giving the trophy to the vivo X80 Pro+ or X90 Pro+, which excel in low light with their impressive sensor combination and software. My winner for Best Overall Camera System in 2022 is the iPhone 14 Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "(gentle music)\n",
      "\n",
      "This has now become the longest defending champion in this category, as it's the fourth year in a row that the iPhone has taken home the camera trophy. The image quality is solid, but it's the speed to open the camera and capture a photo that stands out, along with fast autofocus. I’d rate the Pro iPhones around an A-minus to a B-plus for photos, but when it comes to video capabilities, it’s in a whole different league. I've been running the auto-focus YouTube channel for a couple of months, focusing on cars shot entirely on smartphones, and the difference is remarkably clear when comparing the iPhone’s camera to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s how good it looks, the audio quality, the consistency of color, the ProRes capabilities, and the sharpness. I much prefer shooting videos on iPhones, and I don’t think I’m alone in that regard. Sure, it still takes a while to transfer files from the iPhone, and I hope they correct that. Nevertheless, it’s the winner for Best Camera System.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up is Best Battery Overall. This is likely one of the more objective categories, encompassing more than just battery size. I want to consider the entire battery experience: how long it takes to charge, how long it lasts, battery feature flexibility, and longevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "My winner for Best Battery in a 2022 phone is a defending champion: the ASUS ROG Phone 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "(gentle music)\n",
      "\n",
      "This phone boasts a massive 6,000 mAh battery and supports 65-watt fast charging, allowing you to go from zero to full in under an hour. It also includes numerous battery management features. For example, you can reduce the refresh rate from 165 Hz all the way down to 60 Hz to extend battery life. There are also charge limit features and pass-through charging options. This phone excels in terms of battery life experience, and it charges quickly. The only downside is that it lacks wireless charging, which most other phones in its price range include. But for worry-free battery performance, the ROG Phone wins.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll give a runner-up in this category to the iPhone 14 Plus. Many of us expected this when Apple discontinued the Mini iPhone in favor of a bigger model without the ProMotion OLED display. This unit features a simple 60 Hz display powered by a large battery, with wireless charging and all the other features Apple provides to maintain battery health. It offers a solid battery experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d also like to give an honorable mention to the ASUS Zenfone 9. It continues to amaze me with its battery life, despite having a 4,300 mAh battery without wireless charging. The charging speed is decent, but I was genuinely surprised by how well this compact phone held up in terms of battery life. Who knew a phone this small could boast such great battery performance?\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up is the Design Award. This is perhaps the toughest award to give out each year due to its subjective nature. It has evolved over time from being simply about build quality to focusing on unique design elements. In recent years, it has become less about safe designs and more about who can take risks in terms of appearance, as there’s often a process of elimination involved—it's hard to give this award to overly safe designs or phones that regress from previous models.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, the Design Award goes to the Nothing Phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "(gentle music)\n",
      "\n",
      "This design stands out as arguably the best aspect of the device—it employs a transparent look while featuring a glyph interface with lights on the back that illuminate for notifications. They can also function as a fill flash for video and indicate wireless charging status. While it treads the line between gimmick and feature, I find it unique. It’s neat to see battery life as you are charging. This level of innovation is rare in the smartphone realm, and the rest of the phone is quite good as well. Thus, I’m happy to give the Nothing Phone the Design Award for 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to acknowledge the Xiaomi Mix Fold 2. Several folding phones were released this year, but this one particularly stood out as the first to reach a thickness comparable to that of a typical phone. With design improvements since previous generations, this phone feels very usable and pocketable while providing the benefits of a larger unfolded screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's move on to the Value Award, which I enjoy giving. This one was quite competitive this year. Rather than calling it Best Budget Phone—which means different things to everyone—I refer to it as Best Bang for the Buck. You know you’ve found a good one when a phone hits a great price point at launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "My winner for Best Value Award goes to the Pixel 7. \n",
      "\n",
      "(gentle music)\n",
      "\n",
      "This phone launched at $599 and is one of the best devices you can get for that price. It's clear that it embodies the complete Google flagship experience, powered by the same tensor chip and main sensor as the higher-end model. It has an impressive 90 Hz flat OLED display. The Pixel 7’s value is remarkable; it's hard to recommend the 7 Pro, which is $300 more. This device is simply excellent, so I’m thrilled to highlight it as one of my favorites this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ASUS Zenfone 9 is also among the best options, launching at $699. It showcases the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, substantial RAM, and a 120 Hz flat OLED display. This phone also comes with a side-mounted fingerprint reader, a headphone jack, and impressive battery life. These two phones are both outstanding—it's tough to choose between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "An honorable mention goes to the Realme 10 Pro+. This device features a large 6.7-inch display, a 5,000 mAh battery, and surprisingly good camera performance, even outshining some $1,000 phones in our blind smartphone camera test. It’s a solid package for about $350.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we arrive at the Bust of the Year award. While I don’t enjoy giving it out, it’s necessary. Many phones played it safe this year, leading to some rather boring options—some devices might have been too safe for their own good. However, I won’t fault devices that closely resemble their predecessors, provided the previous iteration was well received.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year's Bust of the Year goes to the OnePlus 10T.\n",
      "\n",
      "(gentle music)\n",
      "\n",
      "It wins for having a significant gap between expectations and the actual product delivered. Not all of this can be attributed to OnePlus, but the brand has been on a gradual decline in value, reputation, software experience, and camera quality. There’s just not much to be excited about, and it feels like the brand’s identity has eroded rather quickly. Following a previous flagship featuring Hasselblad tech, the 10T releases without that enhancement, leaving many wondering about the current direction of OnePlus. So, congrats, OnePlus, on your Bust of the Year award.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we have the MVP award for the most valuable phone. This is not the same as the Value Award; instead, it’s about the overall favorites combined with the best experience and impact on the industry. There are many great smartphones to choose from this year, but picking an MVP was challenging for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have two MVPs for this year. My top dog, my number one MVP award for 2022 goes to the Pixel 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "(gentle music)\n",
      "\n",
      "This phone is genuinely deserving; as mentioned in its previous win, it offers great value, exceptional cameras, and a fantastic display with an outstanding software experience and solid battery life. There really isn’t much missing, making it an incredible overall device.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also feel compelled to mention the ASUS Zenfone 9. \n",
      "\n",
      "(gentle music)\n",
      "\n",
      "This phone had numerous positive attributes and was a big surprise for me this year. The design resonates well with me, even if it doesn't handle wear and tear the best. It’s not equipped with wireless charging, but the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 enables remarkable performance, while the battery life was truly impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Zenfone 9 includes a headphone jack, a speedy side-mounted fingerprint reader, and notably good cameras. Its performance in our blind smartphone camera test ranked it among the top devices. Launched at $699, it proves to be an excellent option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I want to give an honorable mention to the reliable Galaxy S22 Ultra, which has all the essential hardware features. While it doesn’t stand out with anything particularly new, it possesses one of the biggest batteries, the best display, and an impressive camera suite in the market. It’s a solid overall phone and well-deserved of its awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "That concludes the Smartphone Awards of 2022. Feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments below. I know all of you will have opinions on this, as you do every year, and I look forward to discussing it. Also, if you're a company watching and you want your trophy, reach out to me on Twitter or something—I’ll happily ship it out.\n",
      "\n",

      "(upbeat music)\n",
      "\n",
      "All right, there are two new features in this latest laptop from Apple: a new color and a new chip. \n",
      "\n",
      "(upbeat music)\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything that was great about the exterior design of Apple’s laptop remains. It still has a variety of ports, including a full-size HDMI and MagSafe. The high-quality build, boxy design, and super bright display are also still here. However, the awkward aspects are still present too, like the large notch at the top housing only a webcam, with no face unlock feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new color is called Space Black, which appeared much darker in Apple’s announcement video. I was expecting a truly black laptop, and while it does look dark in the commercial, in reality, it’s just a slightly darker version of the previous Space Gray. If you’re looking for a black laptop, there are other brands that offer true black options. Apple’s version is simply a darker gray, which is likely the darkest they could achieve without showing too many fingerprints. It does still show some fingerprints, but it’s better than other black laptops I’ve tried. It’s a middle ground—darker than usual and not overly fingerprint-prone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, it comes with black Apple stickers and a black MagSafe charging cable, although the braided cable is darker than the end. The charging brick, however, remains white, which indicates that Apple hasn’t fully embraced the Space Black theme. I’ll give them partial credit for the effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s discuss the chip inside. The newly announced three-nanometer M3 family of chips brings significant improvements over the M2 family. It feels almost odd to compare it, as few people with an M2 should feel compelled to upgrade to this. However, as a point of reference, I’ve been testing the highest-end M3 Max in this laptop. Compared to the M2 Max, it has seen an increase in GPU cores from 38 to 40 and an upgrade in shared memory from 96GB to 128GB. \n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's claims about CPU improvements seem accurate, with gains of around 20 to 30% over last year. The jump in single-core performance is more significant than I anticipated, which is fantastic for daily tasks and general computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the GPU side, many were hoping for a larger leap in performance. While it is a respectable upgrade, it doesn’t quite leapfrog high-end discrete GPUs. However, the M3 Max's GPU performs at levels comparable to the M1 Ultra, matching benchmarks around the AMD Radeon RX 6800 or RTX 3070—a solid mid-range card.\n",
      "\n",
      "This newfound GPU performance and benchmark results are impressive, but what’s more interesting is how users will actually utilize this power. For a laptop like this, it typically revolves around gaming or high-performance graphics applications. When you see the M3 Max with its hardware-accelerated ray tracing for the first time in a Mac, you might think of gaming. But realistically, Macs aren’t usually associated with gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe this misconception is not due to the performance of Macs—while they might not match the absolute best in the market, they’re still powerful. Instead, it’s largely about the availability of popular games on the Mac platform. If you want to play titles like \"The Witcher,\" \"Fallout,\" \"Skyrim,\" \"Crysis,\" or \"Apex Legends,\" you're likely going to want a PC rather than a Mac—regardless of how powerful it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I find this current moment interesting for gaming on the Mac. While many games are still unavailable, this is the most powerful Mac ever created. I've played some games that Apple highlights in the App Store. For example, \"Lies of P,\" which they discussed in the keynote, takes advantage of the hardware-accelerated ray tracing. The game looks stunning, with high frame rates and 4K resolution providing a beautiful depth and detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "macOS Sonoma offers a gaming mode that optimizes power for games and allows for Bluetooth controller use with lower latency and faster sampling. My experience with this game was impressive, though I’m not particularly invested in it. It was fun to play the demo, and the computing performance was commendable, even if the machine got slightly warm and the fans ramped up during use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the GPU's capabilities, my overall takeaway is that the extra power could be for gaming, but if you’re spending this much on a laptop primarily for gaming, you likely wouldn’t choose a Mac. Still, as a Pro laptop, the MacBook Pro is suitable for non-gaming uses that also benefit from the added GPU power—like Cinema 4D. This new chip enhances performance across the board, and I expect even more applications to take advantage of these advancements over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting on the launch event, I was genuinely excited about the new matte black MacBook and the new chip. I thought this combination would convince me to upgrade. I placed an order for a maxed-out M3 Max MacBook Pro in matte black. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, after testing this review unit, while the color is pleasant, it’s not as groundbreaking as I hoped. The new chip is impressive, but it won’t make a meaningful difference in my workflow, especially considering the videos I edit on the go with my current M1 Max laptop. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, I canceled my order and will continue using my M1 Max 16-inch MacBook Pro that I’ve had for the past three years. While the new model is excellent, it doesn’t serve my needs. The M3 family is more suited for those with older machines who will see a significant upgrade. If you already own an M family chip MacBook at the level you desire—like the M2 Pro or M1 Pro—the M3 Pro isn’t going to be a major upgrade. Similarly, if you have an M2 Max or M1 Max, the M3 Max isn’t necessary for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new launch truly targets users with older Intel machines or those in different tiers looking to unlock a new workflow. The M1 Max remains impressive for my use. Maybe I’ll revisit this with a two- or three-year review. For now, I appreciate the new darker color option, but it oddly isn’t for me. The laptop itself is still fantastic—great displays, exceptional speakers, amazing build quality, and excellent battery life. Perhaps my upgrade will come when Apple fully commits to that matte black aesthetic or makes another significant advancement down the line.\n",

      "Okay, so Apple had a nice, short 30-minute event today announcing a bunch of new iPad stuff. This was the longest they’ve ever gone without updating anything iPad-related, so they had some cooking to do. But the thing is, and I feel like we’ve been saying this for years, it kind of doesn’t matter how powerful they make the iPad. It’s still just an iPad, right? It’s still iPadOS. We’ve seen gigantic improvements in the M-series chips, and these iPads have some of the most powerful chips ever on paper, but they’re still iPads. So the last thing we need after all this time is just another spec-bumped iPad, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, let me introduce you to the newest iPads. First up, there’s a new iPad Air that follows the script of bringing a few things down from the previous iPad Pros while also offering it at a lower price. It upgrades from the M1 to the M2 chip inside, starts with 128 GB of storage now, and moves the webcam to the landscape bezel where it belongs. It gets faster Wi-Fi, and for the first time, there’s a larger version, so they’re calling it the 11-inch and the 13-inch iPad Air. I had to clarify this because the last one was 10.9 inches; are they just simplifying the name? Well, it turns out there is a little bit more screen here. Great! But other than that, it’s pretty predictable. It’s a spec bump—sticking to the script. I think I could hand you the newest iPad right now, and you couldn’t really tell the new Air from the old Air just by looking at it, unless you’re holding the bigger one or if you recognized the super exciting new colors. \n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, hopefully, you could hear my sarcasm through the screen, but there’s Blue, Purple, Starlight, and Space Gray. It’s $599 for the small one and $799 for the bigger one. But then we also got a more significant update to the iPad Pros. This is where they push the limits of the iPad, showing their best stuff and the best possible tablets. Man, if we just ignore the software for a second, these new iPads are ridiculous. \n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, they revealed that these new iPads, the 11-inch and the 13-inch, are the new thinnest Apple devices ever made. That includes phones, old iPods, and everything. The 11-inch is 5.3 millimeters thin, and the 13-inch is 5.1 millimeters thin; that’s literally thinner than the iPod Nano ever was. It’s nuts. It looks ridiculous and feels crazy to hold. I don’t know if anyone ever looked at an iPad Pro and asked for it to be thinner, but that’s what they went and did. What could possibly go wrong? Fun fact: this also means the iPad Air is now heavier than the iPad Pro, just to keep the iPad lineup interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new Pro also gets a new chip and a new screen. Apple introduced us to the next generation of Apple silicon with the M4 chip, and this iPad is the only device it’s in right now. It provides even more power in a tiny physical and thermal envelope, especially since we’re coming from the M2. It’s a more power-efficient 3-nanometer chip. The CPU core is now 50% faster than the M2, and the GPU is up to four times faster. They claim it can deliver the same performance as the M2 with half the power, so it’s super efficient. There’s an improved neural engine and better cooling. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again, while I don’t know who was asking for a thinner iPad, it’s at least visually impressive. This is the type of form factor that’s specifically enabled by the M4 chip. Apple is quoting basically the same battery life as the last iPad Pro, and I have to assume there’s significantly less physical battery in the device because it’s so much thinner. So that likely means Apple thinks that the battery life in the last generation was sufficient, so they’re just matching it, allowing for a thinner design with less battery because the new chip is more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have the new display, another feature enabled by the M4 chip. Both sizes now have OLED screens, and the specs are identical which makes the $300 price difference a bit tougher to justify. But yes, there are now OLEDs in both new iPad Pros. We’ve known the benefits of OLEDs for years: pitch-black blacks, individually lit pixels, and vibrant colors. We were excited to finally see this in a relatively large iPad display, but making a huge OLED that’s also incredibly bright required a bit of engineering ingenuity. \n",
      "\n",
      "They developed something they’re calling a tandem OLED display, which essentially consists of two different OLED displays stacked on top of each other. The new display driver on the M4 chip can address both layers simultaneously, allowing for high local brightness. The specs are now 1000 nits of peak full-screen brightness and 1600 nits of peak HDR brightness on an OLED iPad-sized screen. In person, it looks like a really bright OLED—super colorful with deep blacks. I spent about 30 minutes at a hands-on area, and while the lighting wasn’t ideal, I’ll be reviewing it soon to see if there are any downsides. Overall, it looks pretty great so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, they also announced a Nano texture matte version of the iPad Pro. Now there’s a matte Pro Display XDR. I would be careful about ordering this particular option based on what I’ve seen. It definitely deals better with reflections than a normal display, but like the desktop version, this comes at the expense of some sharpness and contrast. The blacks, for instance, don’t look quite as black, even at optimal angles. I also have to wonder about its durability because the Pro Display XDR is very specific about which microfiber cloth you use—you can literally ruin it with the wrong one. With this iPad, I can feel the difference between the soft-touch texture of the Nano texture and the glossy bezels, and I suspect you’ll only be able to rely on the microfiber that comes in the box. Also, it costs an extra $100 to get the Nano texture, and it’s only available on the 1 terabyte and 2 terabyte highest-end models. So they seem to know people shouldn’t just walk in and grab it off the base model.\n",
      "\n",
      "What probably made the most headlines from today’s announcements is a spec-bumped Apple Pencil. There’s a new Apple Pencil Pro, which looks exactly like the previous version but now has \"Pencil Pro\" engraved on the back. Unfortunately, it’s still not an eraser. This new Apple Pencil Pro has a haptic motor inside, supports Find My, has a new squeeze sensor for activating tools in various apps that support it, and a new gyroscope that makes it rotation-sensitive. I tried it out, and it’s surprisingly precise. So if you’re an artist, this might be perfect for you, especially for the $129 price tag.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a frustrating note: this new Pro Pencil is only compatible with the newly announced iPad Pro or iPad Air. When Apple moved the webcam to the long side, that changed where a lot of the magnets for lining up and charging the pencil were located. So they had to redesign the magnets, creating a new array that’s only compatible with the newest iPads. Why didn’t they just move it to the other side for charging? I don’t know; that seems like it would have made too much sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also a new Magic Keyboard, which is still incredibly expensive, but it’s lighter than the previous generation, has a bigger trackpad, and includes a function row at the top, which is super useful. Plus, the passthrough charging is now faster at 60 watts through the pins in the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, guess what? We just got another set of spec-bumped iPads. They are metal rectangles with incredible power and efficiency in our hands, but they’re still just iPads. Honestly, I don’t know how many more times I can say this: taking advantage of all this power is nearly impossible. There’s a tiny fraction of apps that actually make it worth upgrading. Almost nothing these iPads can do that my M1 iPad Pro can’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t to downplay the hardware because it’s actually amazing. It has a super bright, high-resolution OLED display with deep blacks, the M4 chip with ridiculous power and efficiency, a new CPU, a new GPU, and a better neural engine. I’ve never wanted an iPad to be thinner, but that line about making the iPad feel like a magic sheet of glass really resonated with this model, even if you feel like you could snap it in half the whole time. \n",
      "\n",
      "The awkwardness of this launch mostly comes from timing. WWDC, their Worldwide Developers Conference, is right around the corner, and we expect them to update all their software. iOS, iPadOS—whatever Apple decides to do with that—should be coming soon. So we have these new iPads shipping next week, but all the new software could be fantastic and is expected this summer. This feels like it could be one of the biggest updates yet for these iPads, showing how many more AI features Apple wants to integrate and how they want to enable these devices to serve as primary computers, possibly with more Siri improvements and more. \n",
      "\n",
      "So here we have these impressive spec-bumped iPad Pros, the most powerful iPads of all time and the thinnest Apple devices ever made, yet the list of things they can do is pretty much the same as my three-year-old M1. What a time to be alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of announcements, Ridge and I have finally launched our first product together. We’re starting with the Ridge Wallet—you know, the minimal, high-quality industrial wallet, the modern way to carry cash and cards. I joined Ridge as the Chief Creative Partner earlier this year, and we’re finally releasing our first MKBHD gear together. One of the first things we wanted to do was make MKBHD versions of some existing products, which felt too obvious. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I love carbon fiber and matte black; I don’t know if you knew that about me already, but those were my base inspirations for these two wallets. The MKBHD Carbon Fiber 3k is made of lightweight, ultra-durable carbon fiber with the logo. The Matte Black Everything Wallet is aluminum with a black oil-filled engraving print, which is so cool. These wallets also come with a debossed MKBHD money clip or a cash strap. You can attach or detach them. You can also attach an AirTag or use a Find My card, which I do, so I never lose it. \n",
      "\n",
      "And if you don’t like my designs, that’s fine! Ridge has over 50 other designs in their catalog, including NFL licensed team options if you want to support your favorite team. The store is endless, and if you think it might be time for an upgrade, it’s a great time to try because if you don’t love it after 99 days, you can send it back, no questions asked. That’s pretty sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll let you in on a little secret: it’s 30% off the new gear right now, and if you order a wallet and a key holder at the same time, you get 30% off both. Plus, you can get 10% off anything at ridge.com/mkbhd. You’re welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m excited to launch this stuff and have more coming up later this year. I won’t say too much about that, but you can sign up at the same link for product updates. I’ve told them to only email about that if you sign up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know what you think about these new iPads in general. It’s kind of an awkward waiting period until we get all the new iOS 18 features, but what are your thoughts on the new thinner-than-ever iPads? Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you guys in the next one. Peace!\n",

      "It's crazy that the most interesting aspects of this new laptop are actually the reasons not to buy it. The MacBook Air has just been refreshed, and it's a pretty simple update—maybe even a boring one. There are really only two new features: it has a new anodized finish on the outside, which is supposedly slightly more fingerprint-resistant, and it comes with the new M3 chip inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, the coating doesn't make much of a difference. It still gets fingerprints if you handle it regularly without a skin or case. I would much rather depend on something like a skin from channel sponsor Dbrand. It allows you to customize the colors and will hide fingerprints much better than any metal treatment ever could. Plus, these skins are real leather, so they have a nice plush texture and will patina over time. I'll leave a link to that below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, about the M3 chip. We've seen this chip before; Apple tends to use the same chip across different devices. The M3 chip was announced in October of last year and was quickly integrated into the iMac. Then we got a new MacBook Pro with the M3, M3 PRO, and M3 Max chips. So, this is the new base M3 chip finally making its way into the MacBook Air. Side note—why does it take so long? It feels like Apple staggers these releases on purpose. While they've released the iMac, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air with the M3 chip, the Mac Mini is still on the M2, which is kind of odd. And what about the iPad Pro? Still on M2. When is that going to get updated?\n",
      "\n",
      "The MacBook Air is the most popular Mac for a reason. It’s typically the entry-level Mac that most people see as their gateway into the Mac world. By design, the base MacBook Air has always been one of the easiest laptops to recommend. However, this time around, for two reasons, it isn't as straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, this has nothing to do with the performance of the M3 chip. You can expect the performance improvements you're looking for. Benchmarks indicate a 10 to 20% improvement over the M2, depending on usage. This generation leans more heavily on graphics improvements, and ray tracing is finally included. For applications or rendering that take advantage of that, you'll see a noticeable improvement. Additionally, MacBook Airs—especially the 15-inch model—are known for their great battery life. You also get dual external display support with the lid closed and one external display when the laptop is open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding base storage, the M3 offers significant improvements. If we look back at the M2, the base 256 GB model used a single SSD module instead of two, resulting in slower performance that was about 50% slower than the M1 on paper. While you might not have noticed the speed difference without benchmarks, it was disappointing to have noticeably slower storage in a new M2 device, leading to longer transfer times for large files.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm happy to report that I've seen really good benchmarks on the base storage of the M3 Air, so it seems they’ve fixed that issue—great news!\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what's the deal with the M3 Air? Why am I saying it’s not necessarily the best recommendation? Historically, the MacBook Air has been straightforward to recommend, but with this M3, Apple has also lowered the price of the M2 by a hundred bucks and discontinued the M1. Now, the lineup includes the M3 MacBook Air starting at $1,099, the M2 MacBook Air at $999, and while the M1 has been discontinued, you can still find stock left at retailers like Walmart or Best Buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This ease of recommendation for the MacBook Air relates to regular users—those who primarily engage in light tasks like web browsing, listening to music, having multiple tabs open, working on documents, or occasional light tasks like photo editing and video editing. These users would likely be perfectly fine with the cheaper, identical-looking MacBook Air with the slightly slower M2 chip and slower storage. I think most would be totally happy with that option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s address the base spec issue. This isn’t unique to Apple; it’s a common marketing tactic across the tech industry, akin to how the car industry advertises starting prices. The \"starting at\" price often doesn't reflect what most people actually pay once they customize their options. Apple’s markup for upgrades is absurdly high, making the base price feel more deceptive. \n",
      "\n",
      "The MacBook Air starts in 2024 at 8 GB of shared RAM and 256 GB of storage. Ignoring the fact that the phone I’m using has more RAM and storage, the first available RAM upgrade to 16 GB costs $200. Bumping up to half a terabyte of storage costs another $200. These prices, given Apple's scale, are just outrageous. So even if you upgrade, the MacBook Air M3 can quickly escalate to $1,500. \n",
      "\n",
      "You have two choices: accept that you’re essentially paying over $1,500 for a MacBook Air, or question whether the base spec in 2024 is usable. My answer? Sometimes, yes. If you’re among the group of people I mentioned earlier, those buying a laptop for basic tasks, you likely can perform those tasks just fine with 8 GB of shared memory. People rarely max out their RAM and hit memory swap. Even if they do, it's usually still manageable. It’s when you start doing heavier work like media encoding, exporting, or gaming that it becomes an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're watching this video, you know which group you belong to. For those who primarily do lightweight computing tasks, skip the new M3 MacBook Air. You can easily opt for the M2 MacBook Air and save money. In fact, if you don’t need the brighter display, MagSafe, or the external display support—features you probably don’t need right now—it’s worth looking at the $600 to $700 M1 MacBook Airs available at retailers. Walmart recently advertised the M1 starting at $699, and Best Buy quickly followed with a $649 offer, which is fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the M3 is undeniably more capable and elevates the laptop experience, what Apple silicon has done is raise the minimum level of machine that can perform your workflows. For example, I edit a lot of videos and need the power for Final Cut Pro. In the past, I could only use high-end desktops, but now I can edit on a Mac Studio or even on my M1 Max MacBook Pro on the go, which is a huge advantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "The same applies to gaming or heavy coding. With Apple silicon, you can perform those tasks on a high-end MacBook Air, which is a fantastic option. So, in summary, if you need a powerful machine and do substantial work, the M3 MacBook Air is great and should be on your shortlist. But if you're engaged in light, everyday tasks, consider the cheaper options instead.\n",

      "\n",
      "So AI has been blowing up lately, both in the news and in real-life applications across a ton of industries. Years ago, it was only in relatively small things, like helping doctors detect cancer early using advanced pattern recognition, and then a bit more over the years with autonomous vehicles. But now AI is everywhere. It’s creating whole original pieces of art. It’s holding conversations with humans all over the place. It seems like we’ve just arrived at the beginning of the AI age.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s this chart that keeps popping up which hits especially hard: the time to reach 100 million users. You can see faster and faster adoption curves with increasingly disruptive technologies. The telephone took 75 years to hit the 100 million mark. The mobile phone reached the same milestone in just 16 years. Netflix took only 10 years, Twitter took six, and Gmail took five. Facebook took about 48 months and Instagram hit it in just 30 months. Now TikTok we view as a gigantic existential threat, taking only nine months to reach 100 million users. ChatGPT? Just two months!\n",
      "\n",
      "When looking at numbers like that, it seems almost obvious that we’re clearly on the precipice of something really, really big that’s going to change everything. So seeing Microsoft at the forefront of it with this new Bing shouldn’t really be a surprise. People are already talking to these chatbots and asking it all sorts of questions. It sort of feels natural having this chatbot act as your co-pilot for the web alongside search instead of just a traditional search engine full of links. That sounds pretty cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is one thing that’s going to follow this conversational AI everywhere it goes: sometimes it’s just wrong. Sometimes it just says things that aren’t true because fundamentally, the AI doesn’t know if it’s telling the truth or not. It doesn’t understand that; that’s not part of the model. What we’re seeing is it taking our inputs and then creating outputs based on related words that are most likely to go together. It’s not forming a sentence like humans do; it’s generating a new sentence. So when adding it to a search engine like Bing, it’s scraping all these relevant links and information and synthesizing new sentences just based on how it thinks things should be pieced together. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not sentient; it doesn’t understand what it’s saying, and so it’s definitely not fact-checking itself. We have to keep that in the back of our mind with all of this, right? Every time you see a headline. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s really interesting with these search engines. On one hand, you have Bing, who has everything to gain, and on the other hand, you have Google, who has everything to lose. I’ve had access to this new Bing for a little while; it’s in a limited preview before they push it live to the rest of the world. I’ve just been playing around with it. Basically, it adds this chat experience alongside regular Bing. It’s esssentially the same experience as talking to ChatGPT, but instead of being limited to a fixed data set that cuts off at 2021, it pulls from the entire current web that Bing can scrape from. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, you can type in a question, flip it over to chat, and it’ll give you a nicely written summary synthesized from similar queries. If I ask it something simple, like, \"What’s the average lifespan of a cheetah in the wild?\" It gives me an answer. It provides a convincing bunch of sentences. It even gives me more information than I asked for, telling me about cheetahs in captivity too, which makes it feel very convincing. It also includes little footnotes and citations for some of its sources and links at the end if you want to dig in more. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s really impressive, actually. This is like a real product that’s going to ship all over the world soon. The natural language capability is super impressive; it gives a convincing sounding couple of sentences and strings them together based on my input. But the more you use it, the more you start to notice weird patterns and shortcomings. Again, mostly in the fact that sometimes it’s just going to be wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little game I like to play is to ask it a question you already know the answer to and then read what it says and spot the error. So I asked it now, \"What are the best smartphone cameras right now?\" It gave me the S23 Ultra, Pixel 7 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max with a nice writeup and some specs for each. That’s actually a pretty good list, but it’s wrong about some of these numbers. The S23 Ultra has a 200-megapixel camera and a 12-megapixel front-facing camera. But okay, it’s mostly right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I asked it, \"What are the five best electric vehicles out right now?\" It gave me five reasonable options, but I don’t know any expert who would put the Jaguar I-Pace on their list right now and leave the Rivian off. Basically, the answers it gives are really convincing to someone who doesn’t already know about the subject. But if you’re already an expert in the topic you’re asking about, you’ll find that its responses are like a C+ or maybe a B+ at best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you see what’s happening; now suddenly when you’re asking ChatGPT or Bing about a factual thing or something you need help with, you should probably add these layers on top. Am I a complete newbie in this topic that I’m asking about? Am I just willing to blindly trust whatever this spits out without any further research? Is a B+ answer going to be good enough for me, even if it might have some errors?\n",
      "\n",
      "That might be sufficient for asking something like, \"How old does a cheetah get?\" but maybe not good enough for planning a trip or meal planning for someone with an allergy. And then, if you look around the internet, people have gotten it to give increasingly more unhinged answers as it tries to simulate conversations and maintain a flow with natural language. I’ve seen it argue over simple corrections to spewing weird stories about how it’s spied on its own developers or how it wants to be sentient, gaslighting people about things, and lying about its previous answers. It’s just saying some straight-up scary stuff.\n",

      "\n",
      "To be fair, this version of Bing isn’t public yet; it’s still in a small group testing phase. But even so, Microsoft knew some of it would get out and possibly go viral. It feels like they even programmed in lots of friendly emojis to soften the blow. When it realizes it’s giving an answer on a controversial topic or something with no clear answer, you might get a little smiley face at the end just so you don’t take it too seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, literally as of today, while I’m testing this, it started completely bailing on a lot of topics if they seem even slightly existential or dangerous. It just says, \"Hmm, I prefer not to continue this conversation,\" and then it stops, refusing to answer any more questions until you reset it. That seems like a pretty good failsafe; it’s a good idea in hindsight. But we’ve already seen the other stuff. The damage has been done. \n",
      "\n",
      "The point still stands: this could have only come from Bing. A lot of people might have forgotten about this or might not even know, but Google has been working on conversational AI for years. We’ve seen Google Assistant, and they literally showed an AI chatbot demo on stage at Google I/O in 2021, where you could have a whole conversation with any person or object in the universe that you wanted. Their demo was asking Pluto about itself, nice and friendly, right? Oh, what’s it like to be you, Pluto? What would it feel like if I visited you? How do you feel so far from the sun? \n",
      "\n",
      "The difference with Google is this was never shipped as a product. It was an internal research project. But the idea of displacing their massive search and ads business with a chatbot that gets things wrong all the time is insane; it can’t happen, right? Literally, search and ads make up more than half of Google’s revenue as a company. That’s what having everything to lose looks like.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fair, Google did hold an event in Paris the day after Microsoft’s event, discussing their chat with search AI plans. They did say they’re eventually planning on a chatbot above Google search, called Bard. It was much more subdued, and yes, it literally did have a factual mistake in its promo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, I actually like the idea. I think it’s smart to have AI as a co-pilot for the web to help around the internet. The notion of it summarizing a longer piece into bullet points accurately would be great. The fact that it could give you spark notes for a longer book you haven’t read yet? Cool. It could help with meal planning, trip planning, or making a purchase decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s clear we’re still at the beginning of this. There are so many unanswered questions, from fact-checking to whether schools will embrace this or ban it. How do search engines keep sending traffic to the publishers who are the sources that the chatbot is scraping from? I mean, you get the links at the bottom, but a lot of people won’t click those anymore if you just give them the answer above the search results.\n",
      "\n",
      "So right now, in its current stage, my take is that anything we do with any of these AI tools should be a collaboration with the human touch. You wouldn’t just put in a query in DALL-E and then take whatever it generates and call that art, right? It’s more for inspiration for your own paint and canvas. Likewise, you wouldn’t ask ChatGPT to write an essay and then copy and paste it to submit as your own. It’s supposed to inspire your own framework for the piece, for the human touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, you shouldn’t ask the Bing chatbot what TV you should buy and then mindlessly buy the first one that comes up. It could be fine, but it might also be a C+ answer. You should use that as a springboard for your more informed research, especially on topics you don’t already know much about. So maybe don’t just buy 19 backpacks immediately when asking if they can fit in the back of a Tesla; check its work first.\n",

      "All right, so this is Apple's brand new, latest and greatest iPhone 15. Nothing inside is new or anything we haven’t seen before in some other phone. That doesn’t mean it's not a good phone; you can have a really good phone without it being particularly new—they aren't mutually exclusive. It turns out that is actually Apple's strategy with this device. The more I use this phone, the more I recognize Apple’s textbook late mover advantage strategy at play. They’re taking something we've literally already seen and doing it the Apple way.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the outside, how would I describe this phone’s design? Kind of familiar, somewhat reminiscent of the 14. How does Apple describe it? \n",
      "\n",
      "- \"The iPhone 15 has an all-new design that’s simply gorgeous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All new? Really? I’m not sure about \"all new,\" but this phone definitely inherits the same look and general design as last year’s model. However, what's at least partially new is the way it feels in the hand. As I mentioned in the 15 Pro review, they've done a good job softening the corners. It still looks boxy and has aluminum rails, but it’s more comfortable to hold since the corners aren't as sharp; they're a bit rounded. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is also the first glass-backed non-Pro iPhone with a satin back, and I am loving it. It has a nice, soft touch with frosted glass. There’s a super complicated process to get this single piece of glass on the back to be two different colors and thicknesses, and I can totally respect that. But honestly, the colors are super weak. People were commenting in the last video that the color grading must be off because it looks white instead of blue. No, this blue phone really doesn’t appear very blue at all in almost any lighting; it’s like 1% blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "But either way, you can say that between the aluminum frame and the pale light colors, these are probably the most fingerprint-resistant iPhones in years. On the sides, you’ll find the same button placements, speaker placements, and mute switch; there’s no action button on this phone. Honestly, you could probably use an iPhone 14 case on the iPhone 15.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving to the front, there's a new screen—well, not new, but new to this iPhone. You now get the Dynamic Island on the non-Pro iPhones this year, which is doing the punch-hole cutout the Apple way. The notch is finally dead—until maybe a new iPhone SE brings it back; it could happen. Slowly but surely, app developers have been getting on board in useful ways over the past year. I have a few favorites now, like my airline app giving me real-time flight info, along with weather apps, Uber, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we’re discussing the screen, it’s also brighter—up to 2,000 nits now, which looks awesome outdoors. But it’s 2023, and this is an $800 phone that still has a 60 hertz display. This is quite fascinating to me. On one hand, for most people buying this phone, it’s totally fine. It’s a new baseline iPhone. Have you talked to someone who buys a new baseline iPhone? They literally don’t care. It doesn’t matter; it’s not something they pay attention to. You could ask them right now how many frames per second their phone runs at, and they wouldn’t have an answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as it works and operates relatively smoothly—like last year and the year before—it’s a non-factor. I’ve literally handed a 120 hertz phone to people next to a 60 hertz phone, and even side by side, they can’t see the difference. If they do, it's just a subtle thing that seems kind of neat, but they’d be totally fine missing out on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the target demographic of this phone, it's completely acceptable. But on the other hand, Apple, the richest technology company in the world, often adds subtle improvements or changes that regular people will literally never notice. Like, when they switched these baseline iPhones from LCD to OLED displays, do you think anyone actually noticed? Or when they moved from the A15 Bionic last year to the A16 Bionic? Do you think people noticed the differences? What about when they added 5G to the iPhone, and most people didn’t care? Making subtle improvements over time is what modern smartphones are all about these days.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would argue that a higher refresh rate is more noticeable to more people than some of those other things. I think you could hand me, a professional, an unlabeled iPhone with an A15 and an A16 Bionic chip, and it would take time to find the real differences between them. Given how easy and reasonable it would be to at least incorporate a 90 hertz display—didn’t the new Moto G come out with a 90 hertz display for like $170? I'm sure that’s a horrible looking screen compared to this iPhone, but still, they decided to add that to that phone because Motorola knew enough people would notice it and feel that smoothness difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s wild to me knowing how easy it would be for Apple to make this at least a 90 hertz display, yet they refuse to do it because they’ve attached the word \"Pro\" to that feature. Promotion for the Pro phones. It strikes me as a strategy to widen the gap as much as possible between the Pro iPhones and the non-Pro iPhones. And they’re happy to do it, even if it makes this iPhone 15 the most expensive phone in the world with a 60 hertz display.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of widening that gap, the Pro phones this year also got a brand new A17 Pro chip, while the iPhone 15 retains last year’s A16 Bionic from the 14 Pro. Honestly, the renaming of the Pro chip might be the most intriguing aspect since it implies it’s definitely not going to trickle down to the baseline phone next year. But this A16 Bionic is more than adequate in a phone of this price in terms of performance, handling everyday tasks, gaming, and flying around iOS at 60 hertz.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could argue for a 60 hertz display in terms of battery life because, despite concerns, the battery life on these phones has been quite good. Apple has officially addressed the heat and battery issues some people, including myself, reported with these iPhones. An iOS update is on the way, and it seems some specific third-party apps, like Instagram, were also having issues that should be getting updates too. On average, the battery life on my iPhone 15 has been better than that of the 15 Pro. The 15 Plus looks to have the best battery life ever on any iPhone, which is really promising.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the combination of the A16 Bionic, which isn’t new, and the 60 hertz screens, which are also not new, is resulting in great battery life. USB-C is not new, but here it is, along with all the benefits: using the same cable to charge everything and plugging into various accessories like monitors and keyboards. It's unfortunate that the older chip means there’s no USB 3 controller, so you won’t get USB 3 data speeds; it’s still slow. However, unless you’re using the Pro iPhone’s camera features, almost nobody buying this phone is going to need fast data transfer, so it’s a pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they’ve managed to do it the Apple way. They matched the inside of the USB-C port with the color of the phone, and they actually print the model number inside the port. Apple loves hiding this in the most discreet way possible. \n",
      "\n",
      "I really appreciate some clever software features on the iPhone 15 because you could actually consider them new. They added an ultra-wideband chip so you can find your phone more easily with an Apple Watch or through the Find My app. They also introduced clever audio and video effects at the OS level, so they work in any app. You can be on a phone call or a video call (Google Meet, Zoom, etc.) and activate background noise cancellation, which impressively picks out your voice while minimizing background noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, during a phone call, here’s what it sounds like with a dishwasher running, HVAC going, and a sink running next to me. When switching the mic from Standard mode to Voice Isolation mode, even with the background noise still happening, it does a much better job of picking out just my voice. It’s really smart and genuinely new.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also other not-so-new features, like the addition of downloadable offline areas in Apple Maps and interactable widgets. They’ve also finally added an 80% battery charge limiter in the settings. If you're interested, I did a full video on the iOS 17 update; check out the link below if you want to see that after watching this.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most popular features I mentioned in that video is Standby mode. On the Pro iPhones, when placed on a charger sideways, it keeps the screen on because it drops to one hertz due to its LTPO display, which can stay on like that. But on the non-Pro iPhone, which doesn’t have LTPO, it’s basically locked at either 30 or 60 hertz. Apple just decides to turn off the screen after a little while, which defeats the purpose, so you have to nudge the table or tap the stand to wake it up, similar to an Apple Watch charger. Just a notable difference between the Pro and non-Pro iPhones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, the new cameras are, in an odd way, quite good. The iPhone 15 has been upgraded to a new set of 12 megapixel ultra-wide and a new 48 megapixel main camera. It’s not the same sensor as the Pro; it’s actually slightly smaller but has a larger max aperture of f/1.6 to compensate. It utilizes a combination of binning and detailed transfer to give you a new 24 megapixel photo by default. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve been paying attention, you’ll note that this new iPhone has the same chip as last year’s Pro iPhone, with the same processing cores, image signal processor, neural engine, and A16 Bionic. So, why is this new 24 megapixel default only available on the iPhone 15 and not last year’s Pro? My last year’s Pro phone has the latest software but doesn’t get this feature; it’s still shooting 12 megapixels. \n",
      "\n",
      "Surprisingly, my base iPhone 15’s non-zoomed photos are looking a little better and more detailed than last year’s Pro photos. Then there’s the new auto-Portrait mode detection feature, which is pretty sweet. You don’t have to switch to Portrait Mode to take a photo that captures all the depth information to turn it into a portrait later. As long as you’re pointing the camera at a human subject or animal identified by the neural engine, or if you tap to focus, you’ll automatically see a little “F” at the bottom corner of the screen, indicating it’s capturing data for Portrait Mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, if you decide you want it as a Portrait Mode shot, you can go into your gallery and make it a Portrait Mode photo, which you can further edit. Some have described it as being able to change the focus point later. It's not exactly that; you can’t restore something that was out of focus. But for the classic iPhone shot, where it looks like everything is in focus, you can use the Portrait Mode feature to achieve great results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year’s Pro iPhone also has the same chip, a 48 megapixel main camera, and the same neural engine, yet doesn’t get this feature for some reason. It’s certainly odd.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these reviews, we often judge what we think the typical iPhone buyer cares about and what they’ll notice or appreciate in a new phone. With this one, I feel they’ve stacked enough subtle improvements that even though it looks the same and there’s not much that’s actually new, it feels like a noticeably better phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "My verdict is that if you have an iPhone 14, you don’t need to upgrade, not even from a 13. But if you have an older phone and you’re looking to upgrade, every year I get friends asking, “Should I just get the older, last year’s iPhone to save some money?” My answer is no. I would suggest getting the iPhone 15. There are enough new changes to qualify it as a better phone in every way, and it’s also USB-C compliant. \n",
      "\n",
      "You don’t buy a base iPhone to get the bleeding edge of technology; you buy it because it works, it feels familiar, and will serve you well for the next few years. Since you’ll have it for the upcoming years, I would not recommend buying a Lightning iPhone now that everything has shifted to USB-C. Just get the new one—go for the \"boring\" new iPhone that has nothing that’s actually groundbreaking. It’s simply going to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s it! Thanks for watching, and catch you in the next one. Peace. \n",

      "- In a world of electric cars, we’re going to take a look at a $20,000 hybrid, a $120,000 hybrid, and a $2 million hybrid car. This video serves as both an explainer and a chance to drive some incredible cars. Shout out to Triple F Collection—we’ll get there!\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve seen that electric cars are undergoing a renaissance, surging in popularity to the point where the number one best-selling new car on earth is electric. However, they are still very much a new technology. While they offer instant torque, no emissions, and fast acceleration, they come with heavy batteries that take a long time to recharge, and there isn’t enough infrastructure for everyone to own them. This creates a window where, for most people, a hybrid is actually the best option.\n",

      "Now, I don’t think anyone is buying the Corolla for speed or power. If I'm being honest, it’s surprisingly zippy. The car starts at $24,000 and is a hybrid purely for efficiency. The basics of this hybrid system, and many others in the same category, is that the wheels can be driven by the gas engine, the electric motor, or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Corolla hybrid has a 1.8-liter engine and one electric motor at the front axle, delivering a combined output of 138 horsepower, powered by a small 1.6 kilowatt-hour battery. At low speeds, you might have experienced this before—the car runs totally electric, and the gas engine shuts off. But once you exceed a certain speed or use a certain amount of power, the gas engine kicks in and works alongside the electric motor. Whenever you're braking or coasting, the battery recharges. As you slow down, it captures some of that energy, meaning it never actually needs to be plugged in to charge the small battery. This system achieves an impressive 50 miles per gallon.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you drive this car, there's an eco score that gamifies efficiency. If you slow down and accelerate smoothly, you can maximize your miles per gallon. There’s a bar indicating your eco zone, and it’s satisfying to see it stay there. I've managed to get my eco score into the 70s—not to brag, but it’s pretty good! I wonder what happens when I reach 100, but I do know that a higher score translates to more miles per gallon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything else about this car is designed for efficiency. It’s aerodynamic enough to slip through the air and has low rolling resistance tires, which aren’t designed to be sticky or grippy as that would hinder efficiency. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a reason to buy a hybrid today, it’s that you don’t have to charge a large battery every night or rely on public chargers. It’s mainly about wanting better fuel mileage and spending less—though not zero—on gas.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "This car starts at about $100,000, just over that, and it’s a hybrid designed for versatility. This is a BMW 750e. In this price range, you can benefit from both gas and electric options. \n",
      "\n",
      "This hybrid system has more hardware to achieve its goals. It features a three-liter straight-six engine producing around 300 horsepower and a medium-sized 14.4 kilowatt-hour battery, powering roughly 200 horsepower from the electric motor. In total, you can expect around 500 horsepower. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like the Toyota hybrid, this model can operate on gas or electric. However, the battery capacity is sufficient for about 30 miles of electric driving without firing up the gas engine. Unlike the Corolla, this is a plug-in hybrid, so you can plug it in at home to replenish the battery and drive with zero gas usage as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plug-in hybrids currently make sense for the most people. If you have a short 10-mile daily commute and can charge overnight or during the day, you could potentially never pay for gas again. Yet, if you need to drive farther or take a road trip, you can switch to gas power without issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "These hybrids also include regenerative braking, which helps recover energy once you're at speed, charging the battery as you drive. A little graph on the dashboard shows how energy is used and recuperated through braking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Electric cars boast the party trick of instant torque, and hybrids benefit from that too. The BMW’s powerful motor and sizable battery mean that in sport mode, you receive an electric boost on acceleration, followed by the power surge from the gas engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've often said that heavy cars are the best candidates for electrification. Therefore, this large luxury sedan, with its spacious, cushy interior, is an excellent example. The i7 from BMW fits this mold perfectly. There are also various versions like the RAV4 and Toyota Prius Prime plug-in hybrids. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I were to recommend a single version for most people, this would be it. You get plush suspension, all the tech, and smooth driving. You don’t even need to have a plug in your garage.\n",

      "This is the McLaren Speedtail. McLaren has done this before—one center driver’s seat with two passenger seats. The hybrid system here is designed to maximize power while minimizing weight. There’s a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 engine delivering over 750 horsepower, paired with a small but powerful 1.6 kilowatt-hour battery that drives a single electric motor, adding an extra 300 horsepower. So in total, you exceed 1,000 horsepower.\n",
      "\n",
      "This car has no electric-only mode; the gas engine never turns off, and there are no efficiency goals. It’s similar to the turbocharged hybrid systems seen in Formula 1 today—focused purely on speed.\n",

      "A few of the over-engineered features include cameras instead of side mirrors for optimal aerodynamics and electrochromic glass for the roof and windshield. The active aerodynamics even bend the carbon fiber bodywork during braking, enhancing the vehicle's deceleration.\n",
      "\n",
      "This car is also unique in that it features wireless charging. That’s right—the McLaren Speedtail wirelessly charges! The small battery means that if the driver doesn’t park perfectly over the charger in their garage, it’s not a huge issue, as it can still recharge over time, despite the inefficiency of inductive charging.\n",

      "Let me share a little secret about these super-fast electric cars: they require large batteries to achieve that performance. For instance, the Tesla Model S Plaid generates 1,000 horsepower but relies on a hefty 100 kilowatt-hour battery to sustain that power without quickly draining. This is why high-horsepower electric cars are often heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, a supercar like the Speedtail sacrifices battery size for weight and power, allowing for a tiny battery that delivers massive power in short bursts.\n",

So, when choosing one for yourself, it's all about picking the model that makes the trade-offs you're comfortable with. For instance, if you prioritize good build quality and cameras, the iPhone SE might be the right choice for you. Just know that you may have to compromise on screen quality or battery life.

Nothing has shown this design to the public, receiving mixed reactions; some people love it, while others don’t. Personally, I find the asymmetrical design unconventional yet appealing.

Firstly, the back is made of clear plastic instead of glass. I think this could make it easier to scratch, though harder to shatter compared to glass, which seems a reasonable compromise. The phone features a textured plastic frame that mimics aluminum, making it surprisingly light for its size.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And speaking of size, this is a large phone; it's practically jumbo-sized and is 6.7 inches corner to corner, which is quite substantial. While some may not prefer a large device, many people enjoy having a big screen, reaping the benefits of having a sizable battery and display. The screen gets bright; it’s not flagship-level brightness with some of the numbers we’re seeing today, but a peak brightness of 1300 nits is quite visible in bright indoor conditions. The bezels around the front are minimal, so aesthetically, I have no complaints. Additionally, it boasts an AMOLED display with an optical fingerprint reader under the glass, a variable refresh rate of up to 120 Hz, and 2160 Hz PWM dimming. If you’re not a fan of the phone's back design, the front is impressive for $350.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Battery life is another key strength of this device. The battery performance derives from three main factors: a large physical battery, good software, and an efficient chip. The phone comes equipped with a 5000 mAh battery, which is larger than those in Nothing's flagship models. While it lacks wireless charging, it does feature 45-watt wired charging, which can get the battery from zero to full in an hour. The device is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro chip, which was a significant point of curiosity for me during testing. Knowing how Nothing teases specifications beforehand, I wondered how this MediaTek chip would perform, especially since they showcased selective benchmark results only compared to the two-year-old Nothing Phone 1, which used a mid-range Qualcomm 778G Plus chip.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I wasn't expecting flagship performance at this price point, I did wonder how it would hold up. I’ve been pleasantly surprised. It's not going to win accolades for raw specs, and the benchmark scores may not be mind-blowing, but in practical use, I find it respectable. This is largely thanks to the software and its optimization.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, we’re running Nothing OS 2.5 on top of Android 14. You might be familiar with Nothing Phone’s aesthetic featuring dots and its unique fonts. The clean interface lacks bloatware and emphasizes speed and smoothness, reminiscent of the early days of OnePlus. Regular use reveals that this phone is smooth and snappy. Occasionally, you might notice a slight lag with the fingerprint reader when unlocking, but overall, general tasks—like messaging, browsing apps, and taking photos—are performed seamlessly. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can expect a solid experience similar to what was found on the Nothing Phone 1 with the 778 chip. It handles everyday use well; however, when you attempt high-end tasks like gaming, you may notice the performance lag compared to high benchmarks. But again, it’s a $350 phone, so I have no complaints.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing has taken time to develop their aesthetic and identity, and I have to say, they’ve incorporated a lot of unique, identifiable features into this device. You might love or hate them, but they are all present. Aesthetic elements include dot motifs throughout, consistent with their stock apps and system navigation. They also offer a well-established selection of Nothing widgets, allowing for a consistent home screen vibe.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are also neat features, such as enlarging a single app icon to occupy a four-grid space on your home screen, which some might find appealing. The folders on the home screen have a nice animation, and there’s a new option to add a glass effect to your wallpaper, blurring it for better visibility—a feature I particularly enjoy. AI wallpapers are also available, letting you create interesting combinations with just a few taps. Third-party icon pack support makes the customization options endless, complete with instant previews.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the glyphs, this phone still has lights on the back—fewer than the flagship model, but similar in functionality. There’s one vertical light on the right, a smaller one on the bottom left, and a larger one arcing around the top left. The latter works with the glyph countdown timer, which might be useful for some.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The blinking notification glyph when the phone is face-down could use some more customization options. I’d love RGB capabilities to set different colors for various app notifications, but it still functions with white lights. There are also music visualizations that sync with audio output.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, some of these features may feel gimmicky or only occasionally useful, but I find some novelty in them, like the glyph fill flash, depending on the situation. But let's talk about the camera. The rear cameras are serviceable; they aren't going to stun you, but they get the job done. We generally approach reviews of budget phones with the expectation that their cameras won’t impress.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This model features a new 50-megapixel primary camera, alongside the same ultra-wide camera seen in the Nothing Phone 2 and a similar selfie camera. While it can capture decent photos, even with the 50-megapixel resolution, low-quality images emerge in good lighting conditions, with less than stellar sharpness, dynamic range, and depth of field. This phone isn't designed for capturing the most artistic photos and videos, but it is functional for moments like document scanning, video calls, and sharing quick snaps—completely adequate for those needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "What struck me most is that this model retains many features found in Nothing's flagship phones. The only exception is the macro mode. This consistency, with advanced settings and features from the more expensive models, gives a good feel for this device as a budget-friendly option, making it seem like they’re trying to provide as much of the Nothing experience for less money.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, it’s important to acknowledge the cuts that have been made; for example, there’s no wireless charging, it has an IP54 rating instead of IP68, and the construction is plastic rather than glass and aluminum. Nevertheless, using the phone, especially with its software features, doesn’t feel like there are many glaring omissions. There’s no missing pro mode setting in the camera; all advanced settings and features from Nothing OS are present on this cheaper model.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while they aim to position this phone against others in the lower-end market, I instinctively dismissed comparisons to the Phone 1. However, looking back, one can appreciate how much progress has been made. The Nothing Phone 2A offers a larger, brighter screen with thinner bezels, a larger battery with faster charging, a higher processor clock speed, a higher-resolution front camera, and a wider variety of refresh rates than the Phone 1. No wonder they want to showcase the Phone 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "To wrap it up, if you're seeking a TL;DR: this is indeed a solid, all-around budget phone. With Nothing promising three years of Android updates, I believe it represents a great budget option for the next few years. Well done, Nothing. Well done.  \n",
      "\n",

      "The most dangerous thing about the Tesla Cybertruck is not the pointy edges and corners. It's not the fact that it weighs over three tons and goes from zero to 60 miles per hour faster than a Corvette. It's not even the way reflections glare off the stainless steel and can blind people on the highway. No, the most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck is the way it makes other people on the road behave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, I genuinely can't tell if the Cybertruck is good looking or not, and I'm being completely serious. If you check the comment section online, it's mostly negative. Most people say it looks horrible, like a refrigerator on wheels, and that it’s a disaster of design. But once you start living with this thing, driving around and talking to people who have never heard of it, they often say things like, \"This is crazy. This is like a movie prop. It’s sci-fi; it looks like something alien.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "So, there’s a lot to consider. First of all, you have stainless steel and black plastic—that's mostly the materials involved. The front has a good angle; I'm a sucker for a light bar, though the actual headlights are placed lower to avoid blinding others. Overall, it has a square jawline—no curves, just angles. However, the back isn’t so appealing. While it's still technically a bar, I find it a bit lacking. Plus, there’s just a lot of black plastic in the back and an exceptionally high tailgate. It gives off dump truck vibes, which I don’t think many people would disagree with. I don’t think the back is its best angle. \n",
      "\n",
      "But if I had to narrow it down, I’m fairly certain that the most iconic profile is the side. The two elements that really stand out are the slope and high shoulders, along with the pointy corners on the other side. Most pickup trucks have a more traditional shape, so we’re not used to seeing this angular design and that enormous slope. It’s unusual, weird, and very visually interesting. \n",
      "\n",
      "After living with the Cybertruck for about a month and driving over 1,500 miles, you notice a few things. First, whenever you park, people always want to come up and talk about it. Naturally, I’ve entertained many of these conversations because they’re fun. They usually ask two things: First, you’d be surprised how many people have never heard of the Cybertruck. For us online people, it’s hard to imagine anyone not knowing about it, but it’s true. Secondly, most people just want to know, “How much does that thing cost?” I got asked that so many times that I eventually started having people guess. Every guess was too high, ranging from $150K to $300K. It’s understandable; they’ve only seen this unique vehicle for the first time, so they can’t know its actual cost. This tells me that the look of the truck is drawing attention away from everything else that defines the Cybertruck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s play a little game. I’m going to name a feature, and all you have to do is think about it for a second and decide whether you believe it’s overrated or underrated. Then I, someone who’s driven this truck, will tell you the real answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "First feature: steer-by-wire. This involves a complete physical disconnect between the steering wheel you're holding and the wheels moving under the truck. Instead, it’s driven by sensors reacting to your input, much like a video game controller. With the variable steering ratio and four-wheel steering, this feels like the most nimble, agile truck I’ve ever driven. I don’t think many people realize that, so I’d call it underrated. Tesla definitely didn’t have to implement this technology. They already made headlines with the design; it could’ve been a simple Model 3 underneath. Instead, they went through the effort to engineer a full steer-by-wire system that’s safe. I believe they’re the first to do this. \n",
      "\n",
      "The variable steering ratio is what enhances its utility. At low speeds, you can turn very quickly with minimal input, making parking and sharp turns so much easier. At highway speeds, it softens, allowing for a smoother driving experience. The addition of four-wheel steering allows this huge truck to pivot around a much smaller axis. The steering feels impressive for a vehicle of its size, and once you get used to it, driving something like an F-150 feels archaic by comparison. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next feature: bulletproof stainless steel. I’ll say overrated. Having a durable truck is undoubtedly useful, but claiming it’s bulletproof to nine-millimeter rounds? I’m not going to test that. There are some other YouTubers who will, and it can stop smaller rounds without being punctured. However, the glass windows aren’t bulletproof—they’re just stronger than regular glass, and the wheels and tires are still vulnerable to slashing. So don’t think this thing is invincible. That said, cold-rolled stainless steel is going to be much stronger than regular materials, protecting against minor accidents. It’s great for bumpers but also means your truck will show fingerprints easily. \n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, Tesla had to create new machines to manufacture and shape this material. That's why you don’t see many other cars made like this. As I mentioned in my Auto Focus review, the early production issues in low VIN Cybertrucks are not uncommon for Tesla. The early batches, like the dual-motor all-wheel drive model I received, can have panel gaps and other issues. For example, my driver’s side door had a growing gap that started making odd noises. Eventually, it broke because the bolts holding the latch weren’t tightened properly. Thankfully, my friend Miles taped it securely until it could be fixed. Elon Musk responded to the issue on Twitter, noting it affected only 15 trucks, so if you have this problem, you can get it fixed at a Tesla service center with an appointment. \n",
      "\n",
      "My Cybertruck has been flawless so far, but I believe early models will have issues, just like any other Tesla. Regarding the Cybertruck's features, many early adopters are willing beta testers. It should eventually make production cheaper and easier, but “eventually” is key here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s move on to truck stuff. This refers to the reasons someone might logically buy a truck over other vehicles for towing, hauling, and off-roading. While the Cybertruck certainly looks capable, I think these capabilities are overrated. Don’t get me wrong; it’s way more capable than any other Tesla, handling winter weather well due to its heated windshield wipers and mirrors. It even has a wade mode that raises the suspension for deep water. However, when it comes to off-roading and towing, most people will likely use it primarily on the street, similar to an SUV. \n",
      "\n",
      "Consider this: 63% of truck drivers admit to rarely or never towing anything at all. For those who buy a truck specifically for towing, they already have short lists of trucks they’re considering, and none of them are electric. I believe millions of pre-orders for the Cybertruck are largely due to its novelty, making it many people’s first truck experience. While the Cybertruck looks massive, it’s actually smaller than an F-150. New owners may feel invincible in taking it off-road but might find themselves getting stuck in embarrassing situations, leading to criticism and exaggerated stories about the Cybertruck’s capabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll be using the Cybertruck at our video production studio for hauling gear and other practical reasons, but I’m aware that many future owners will simply drive it on the street because it looks cool. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next category: performance. You might have seen Tesla’s clever YouTube video racing the Cybertruck against a Porsche 911 while towing one and winning. This taps into the EVs’ reputation for straight-line speed. However, comparing a pickup truck to a sports car isn’t typical. \n",
      "\n",
      "While EVs are quick, cars with traditional gears can often be faster. For instance, the Cybertruck’s best run recorded a 10.9-second quarter-mile, which is astonishing for a 7,000-pound pickup truck. The Cybertruck launches faster than a 911 Turbo S due to its weight and traction control system. Although it holds a lead initially, the Porsche eventually overtakes it as physics takes over with gear shifts. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Tesla video cleverly showcases the Cybertruck towing a Porsche 911 to emphasize its strength. However, it presents the outcome in a way that might not be entirely accurate regarding the distance covered in the race. \n",
      "\n",
      "To summarize, the Cybertruck is very quick off the line, but its performance is more suited for sheer speed rather than curves. This doesn’t take away from the appeal of its performance for many buyers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s talk about the 800-volt architecture and 48-volt low-voltage system. I’m putting this in the underrated category; the Cybertruck is technically the lightest fully electric pickup truck in the world. It is lighter than the Hummer EV, the F-150 Lightning, and even the smaller Rivian R1T. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I was expecting it to charge as quickly or faster than other Tesla models. It charges at about 250 kilowatts at V3 Superchargers for the initial third of the charging curve. Although this number might seem lower than expected, it’s influenced by the vehicle’s efficiency. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to emphasize the impressiveness of the Cybertruck’s suspension. There’s considerable travel between the lowest and highest settings, which is impressive. While it doesn’t drive like a sports car, it has a low and firm feel when adjusted appropriately. I found little body roll or yaw; it drives remarkably well for a large truck. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, Tesla's minimalism in its design and controls remains a point of discussion. While many prefer physical buttons over digital ones, Tesla has minimized components to reduce manufacturing costs and complexity. However, I believe the Cybertruck could benefit from some physical controls, particularly for climate control and other functions, which would enhance user experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite all the technical aspects, it’s still a Tesla at heart. It works with Tesla Superchargers and has a robust battery under the floor for a quiet interior that enhances sound quality. That said, there are currently missing features in these early models, such as the additional range extender battery, the light bar, and the locking differential in certain versions, just to name a few.\n",
      "\n",
      "While driving to the studio recently, I noticed people's reactions to the Cybertruck. One biker glanced at it briefly and then waved as he rode past. Later, I was in traffic when a car pulled up next to mine, and to my surprise, four happy faces leaned out of the windows, waving thumbs up and grinning ear to ear. That’s about the ratio of joy to absolute disgust you bring into the world driving the Cybertruck—around 80-20.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what’s the final verdict on the Cybertruck? There’s a lot to unpack in terms of materials, technology, and design. The Cybertruck’s design could be considered iconic, along with the baggage that comes with it. Iconic designs are often rare, like the Lamborghini Countach or Bugatti Veyron. \n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, the Cybertruck is rare, generating excitement when people see one, as it’s likely their first encounter. However, it’s set for mass production, which might lessen this novelty over time. There are over two million pre-orders for the Cybertruck, while there were only ever about 2,000 Countaches made. So it's hard to find a comparable vehicle that begins life as iconic but is mass-produced. \n",
      "\n",
      "I remember a comment on a previous video that compared the Cybertruck’s potential future to the PT Cruiser. Initially, it garnered attention for its unique design, but Chrysler produced over a million of them, normalizing their presence on the road. As they became commonplace, perceptions changed. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the question remains: will the Cybertruck follow the same path? Only time will tell. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for watching, and catch you in the next one. Peace.\n",

      "Okay, so the Tesla Robotaxi unveiling event was a couple of days ago, and it might be the strangest tech event I've ever attended. You may have seen some clips from it by now. I was there, I rode in the self-driving Robotaxi, explored the striking Robovan, and even interacted with the Optimus robot. By the time I left, I felt somewhat confused—it was definitely a peculiar event. Here are the three main reasons why.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, the Robo cab was the main attraction we were anticipating: the full unveiling of a completely self-driving Tesla. When we saw it, it resembled a mini Cybertruck, complete with a light bar on the front and back, and an obvious lack of rear visibility. It's a two-door, two-seater passenger car. People had been curious what a full self-driving Robo cab would look like compared to a traditional vehicle like a Model 3 or a Waymo. There were notable differences; the exterior had a distinct light gold color, and every vehicle was painted in this silvery-gold hue, though no mention was made of the materials used. \n",
      "\n",
      "The design had a compact footprint and, significantly, no exterior door handles or mirrors. Because it doesn’t require a steering wheel or pedals, Tesla has pushed the seating position back, giving it more of a lounge-like feel. It features a center armrest and a massive 21-inch touchscreen at the center. Yes, the doors open upwards, seemingly ignoring lessons learned from the Model X. Visually, this design is striking, alongside wheels that at first glance appear to be huge gold discs, but are actually normal 21-inch low rolling resistance Continental tires with half the sidewalls painted gold to match the center caps. This gives the illusion of a super thin low-profile tire, but in reality, it’s just paint.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it’s still uncertain how much of this will make it to final production. After waiting in line for a bit, I finally got to ride in the vehicle for a few minutes. I got in, and the screen prompted me to buckle my seatbelt. Once I did, the door automatically closed—quite smart. I then selected my destination on the screen, which seemed to be on a pre-mapped route, and the car started moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've experienced self-driving Teslas before, but this time felt a bit more nerve-racking since there were people everywhere and no steering wheel in front of me. After overcoming the initial eeriness of being in a driverless car with no manual override, I began to take notice of my surroundings. I sat quite low to the ground, similar to a Model 3, but had more legroom since the seating was pushed back. There were even fewer physical controls than before; the only physical interface I found was for the window switches, located in the middle next to the cup holders. The doors could only be opened with a button on the enormous touchscreen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like other Teslas, this vehicle controls everything through the touchscreen, including the ability to watch movies while the car drives—because why not? You can view an unedited recording of my ride on the auto-focus channel, which I’ll link below.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, that was about all we learned. Shockingly, there were very few details actually shared about the car during the event, aside from three main points in various headlines. First, it will be fully unsupervised and self-driving capable. Second, it will be available for under $30,000. And third, it will utilize inductive wireless charging, meaning it can park over a charging pad to recharge—a feature that isn’t widely seen in vehicles, especially not those with large batteries. That was it: no additional numbers or specifications. Just a glimpse of the concept. I had countless questions after witnessing that.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the announcement, I walked around and chatted with some Tesla engineers and team members who worked on the project. I ended up grilling them with questions. My first inquiry was about the lack of a steering wheel or pedals. I asked what would happen if an accident was imminent, and the car didn’t react in time—would there be a manual override? The answer was that there would be minimal on-screen controls available, but the goal was that manual intervention would never be necessary, which is certainly a noble aim. However, it’s hard to fathom this in the current world, where accidents happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, regarding wireless charging, I asked about its implementation. The main reason, again, is to make the vehicle completely autonomous. They want it so that people can own several vehicles that all drive around and charge themselves overnight. This eliminates the need for human intervention in the charging process. However, I wondered if there would at least be a charging port for supercharging or quick charging, and the answer was no. The vehicle won’t be able to use Tesla superchargers or make long road trips—it’s purely a taxi option. I was informed there are no plans for a front trunk—only a rear trunk was shown at this presentation—and there was no stated range or battery size.\n",
      "\n",
      "What they did mention was their aim for maximum efficiency. They hope to achieve about 5.5 miles per kilowatt-hour, while some of the most efficient electric vehicles on the market today get around 3 to 4 miles per kilowatt-hour. If they achieve this, it could translate to a smaller battery size, possibly around 40 kilowatt-hours, instead of the typical 70 to 130 kilowatt-hours. It logically checks out that to create the cheapest and most efficient electric car, they must focus on these aspects, but it also poses significant challenges, especially considering the design choices like scissor doors and wireless charging.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest red flag for me, however, was the timeline presented. Elon has a notorious reputation for ambitious timelines. He announced, “We’re going to have this vehicle out for $30,000 before 2027.” I doubt that’s feasible. If they manage to pull it off, I will shave my head on camera because I simply can’t see it happening. I want to remain optimistic, but the hurdles are substantial—regulatory approval for full self-driving capabilities and getting prices down amidst inflation, and successfully producing a vehicle with unconventional features, all within two years—it seems improbable. Tesla has promised fully autonomous self-driving for years and continually postpones it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Price-wise, I understand the ambition, but Tesla once promised a $35,000 Model 3 and only briefly shipped for that price before discontinuation. As for the Cybertruck, remember the initial stated price for the cheapest version? It was $39,000 about four or five years ago. What’s the current price for that model? It's around $95,000. So you can see where my skepticism arises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philosophically, there’s a question about the difference between this Robotaxi and a Model 3. Tesla has been claiming for years that the cars people are buying today will be capable of full self-driving, including the Model 3 and Model Y. It's unclear how different the Robotaxi will be. Sure, it lacks a steering wheel and has a different seating configuration, but if my Model 3 can potentially do the same tasks, I’d prefer the one that can connect to superchargers and transport people. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe in the future, it’ll be seen as old-fashioned to want a car with a steering wheel, but for now, the Robotaxi's main advantage is likely that it will be cheaper, smaller, and easier to operate within a fleet context. They have been selling the dream that the vehicle you own today can drive itself while you work, earning you money while you’re not using it, then return home to you. But will it actually fulfill those capabilities?\n",
      "\n",
      "During the event, there was a moment that stood out. Elon mentioned that the Model 3 and Model Y will also feature full self-driving and added, “Don’t worry, Cybertruck too.” Then someone called out about Hardware 3, referring to older Model 3s, and he responded, “Let’s not get nuanced here.” \n",
      "\n",
      "So it seems Tesla intends all their cars will drive autonomously except for perhaps some older models. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, they reminded us that they’re not just a car company but also an AI company by showcasing the Optimus humanoid robot. Throughout the event, these robots danced and performed pre-rehearsed demonstrations. They also interacted with attendees, serving drinks and snacks, and engaging with people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've previously shared my thoughts on humanoid robots and Tesla's Optimus. What we witnessed at the event was indeed impressive, moving beyond earlier displays. But then they took it a step further—having the robots engage in conversation. In one instance, a robot asked someone if they wanted chocolate and engaged in a brief exchange. It felt like a person was just speaking through a speaker; the robot even stuttered and made occasional human-like mistakes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Attendees noted that there were different voices amongst the robots, which raises questions. As of recording, Tesla has not acknowledged this at all. Engineers I spoke with noted that all language models run on-device, but skepticism remains about the extent of human control involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "This led to a whispering doubt over how much of the event was authentic and how much was staged. It brought to mind the Disney Imagineering Labs experience where controllers operated robots for entertainment. Essentially, while impressive, there's significant human assistance involved here too, which is likely the case at Tesla's event as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "They are selling a vision of the future with these robots helping people with chores and tasks—essentially being companions. While AI is progressing rapidly, I believe that vision is still far-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Tesla's credit, this event was bold. They demonstrated self-driving tech among crowds, showcased humanoid robots interacting, and even included a drone show. It all represented a hopeful vision of the future, although still largely conceptual. Despite this optimism for a future that could be more efficient and advanced than today, the challenges and timelines being pitched seemed overly ambitious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction of robots added doubt about the authenticity of the presentations—how much is real and how much is artificial? Increasingly, the focus shifted from the exciting potential of the future to questioning the veracity of the demonstrations.\n",

      "If any company can bring this vision to fruition, it just might be Tesla, given their significant data-gathering capabilities from real-world use today. I’ll remain hopeful, but I’ll believe it when I see it. Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace!\n",

      "I actually love this thing. I love it, not because it's flawless—far from it—but because it's genuinely interesting. Don't forget that the comments on Apple product reviews over the past two to three years have been mostly about how boring they are, with remarks like, \"It's just a spec bump,\" \"there's nothing really new here,\" or \"they hardly change anything or try anything new these days.\" But this device is interesting. It's risky, and most importantly, it's new. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it's not fundamentally new—it's a VR headset—but it's new for Apple. There are numerous features here that are unique and innovative in a way that only Apple would attempt. Just as captivating as this individual product is the potential future it suggests. When you encounter a first-generation product like this, you naturally assume there are goals for its future, that it will evolve through subsequent generations, and there is a vision for what it will become a decade from now. We saw the trajectory of the iPhone, the Mac, the iPad, and other first-generation products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, as far as I know, Apple has never released another first-generation product with \"Pro\" already in the name, which carries an entirely different set of implications. So, is the world ready for all of this? Let’s dive in.\n",
      "\n",
      "(upbeat music)\n",
      "\n",
      "I may be one of the few people outside of Apple who has been using the Vision Pro the most over the last two weeks. I've spent hours in this device, testing both bands, using multiple Macs in different setups, in various rooms, indoors and outdoors, in light and dark environments. Some aspects of this device are absolutely amazing—unparalleled and the best I've ever experienced. However, its intrigue lies in its novelty, along with the downsides and trade-offs that come with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of my last video, I provided a preview of my pros and cons list. If you haven't already watched that video, I highly recommend it, as it serves as a prelude to this one. It's a comprehensive half-hour discussing how to use this device, how it works, what's inside, and its capabilities. At the end, I covered the upsides: immersiveness, placement and space, eye tracking, hand control, passthrough, ecosystem, and spatial audio. The downsides included weight, comfort, the external eyes, current app selection, battery life, and price.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, I want to refine \"immersiveness\" to \"fidelity,\" as I think that better captures what I'm trying to express. I've used several different VR headsets, and the Vision Pro boasts the sharpest, best-looking micro-OLED display of them all. The size of the individual pixels on these displays is just seven and a half microns, which means you could fit 64 of them in the space of a single pixel on an iPhone screen. You can't see individual pixels, and there's no screen door effect—it's excellent. The native refresh rate is 90 Hz, and it can increase to 96 Hz for 24 FPS content for a smooth experience. Apple claims they calibrate each Vision Pro display from the factory for maximum color accuracy. It's impressive and a major factor in why this headset is so costly.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, and this theme will recur, the Vision Pro's technology runs into limitations with today's capabilities that might not fulfill the ideal expectations. While the screens are extraordinary and filled with pixels, the computer inside can't consistently render everything in high resolution at 90 Hz. Instead, it employs clever foveated rendering—meaning it only renders in high resolution what's directly in your line of sight. The rest remains soft and fuzzy. This approach aligns well with how our vision operates. It's smart; you don’t have to think about it, but the object you're focused on appears sharp, while your peripheral vision remains soft, which is completely acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, most of the computing power goes into tracking your eyes rapidly to ensure there’s no lag between your gaze and what comes into sharp focus. Fun fact: you can see this in screen recordings from the Vision Pro. The area of the screen you're looking at is sharp, while the surrounding portions—sometimes even parts of the same window—are intentionally fuzzy. In my view, this looks completely natural since you're concentrating on one object at a time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've also found that you can screen record with developer mode in Xcode, resulting in 4K clips rendered in high quality all at once. However, every time I've done that, the recording was choppy, and scrolling appeared slow and jittery. This likely stems from the computers not being optimized for consistently rendering everything in high quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The screens are exceptional; the positional tracking of objects and spaces is impressive, and the eye tracking is superb. Yet, one drawback to immersion in the Vision Pro—something not many are discussing—is its field of view. Initially, when using the headset, you might not notice it; you're too captivated by the novelty and how well your eyes control the device. But eventually, as you explore the periphery, you realize that, while people often say the headset looks like ski goggles from the outside, it also feels a bit like skiing goggles from the inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "The middle of the view is incredibly sharp, but to illustrate, the edges of the headset are positioned slightly inward from the edges of your vision. Thus, you experience a bit of a cone effect, along with some chromatic aberration around the edges. You wind up feeling as if you're peering through a large tunnel. Apple hasn’t published any field of view numbers for the Vision Pro, which I suspect is intentional since I've observed that the Quest 3 has a broader field of view when looking inside the headset. If I could change one thing about the Vision Pro to enhance immersion, it would absolutely be to widen the field of view—no question.\n",
      "\n",
      "(upbeat music)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vision Pro features the best passthrough of any headset I've ever used—that much is clear to me, and surprisingly, it doesn't really catch me off guard. Perhaps it's because this product underscores how deeply Apple is considering the future; they talk extensively about AR and how they want to overlay digital things onto the real world. However, with today's technology, that's not completely achievable yet. Instead, they present this VR headset but leverage the highest quality camera feeds and displays inside to make it feel almost as if you're looking through it at the real world.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you put on the headset, the first thing you see is passthrough—it's almost like a transparency mode. The sharpness, color quality, and minimal latency are so impressive that I don’t experience any eye fatigue, no matter how long I'm in passthrough mode, even with my eyes inches from the screens. I can interact with my surroundings, pick things up, and walk around without tripping. I even tried catching things thrown at me and succeeded. I managed to play table tennis with the headset on, which is remarkable when considering the technology at play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple states the total latency is 12 milliseconds, which accounts for the outside light hitting the sensors to the updated image appearing in view—an incredibly swift process, including the camera's exposure time. That’s the effect of the specially designed R1 chip. However, as Nilay from The Verge pointed out, it’s still cameras and screens—the technology of today isn’t magic. You still need to expose a camera sensor and adjust the ISO, shutter speed, and similar variables. You can manipulate these settings somewhat by looking at bright objects or high dynamic range environments. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the variety of situations I've tested, it has performed impressively, prioritizing smoothness and high shutter speeds at the cost of increasing ISO, leading to more noise in darker environments. Though it’s the best I’ve seen with current technology, it still has a long way to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "(upbeat music)\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, the ecosystem is arguably the strongest selling point for a regular person considering the current version of the Vision Pro. Whenever a new major product is released, I often receive texts from friends asking, \"Hey, Marques, what do you really think about the Vision Pro? Is it good enough? Should I get one?\" The honest answer is probably not.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I must say there are several things I genuinely look forward to using on it, most of which are ecosystem-related. For example, built-in apps work seamlessly. iMessage operates flawlessly, just like on any iPhone or iPad linked to your account. Photos are readily available directly from your iPhone. This headset is undoubtedly best suited for users within the Apple ecosystem. Little features, like continuity, also stand out—for instance, you can copy text on your Mac or iPhone, hit paste, and it shows up in the Vision Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two specific features that impress me for entirely different reasons: FaceTime and Mac Virtual Display. FaceTime sets a new standard for an Apple product in a long while. From the personas scanned in by the front cameras to the positional tracking and responsiveness of the spatial audio, it all feels exceptionally well thought out. Once everyone on the call moves past the initial surprise of seeing a virtual version of themselves, conversations start to feel more natural than a typical FaceTime call. It compensates for the downside of lacking the ability to hold objects up to the camera with a button that can switch to a real-time, first-person view, allowing you to use both hands instead of one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, sound from the speakers still leaks into the surrounding environment, making anything above half volume easily heard by those nearby. Yet it sounds impressive for not being actual headphones. The Mac Virtual Display is my favorite feature of the Vision Pro, even beyond watching movies. \n",
      "\n",
      "While remote desktop viewing on devices like the Quest 3 is excellent, the Vision Pro offers a unique experience. It connects to your Mac, taking in and re-rendering a new virtual display rather than merely mirroring what's shown on your computer. You can utilize your Mac with all its controls as usual while creating a monitor as big as you want. Plus, you can open multiple Vision Pro apps around that Mac display, positioning them throughout your virtual room—on the walls, floating in midair, or pinned to various objects. It's limitless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it perfect? No, there are inevitable trade-offs. You can’t see your keyboard when immersed, you're limited to a single virtual Mac monitor at a time, and you must direct your gaze at whatever you’re controlling—this does demand extra mental effort. Still, despite those drawbacks, this is my favorite feature of the Vision Pro. It's the primary reason to purchase it, offering capabilities no other Apple product can replicate. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had a moment where I was using the Vision Pro for an extended period, and after taking it off for a quick break, I looked at my wall expecting a window that wasn’t actually there; I'm not sure if that reflects more on the headset or me.\n",
      "\n",
      "(upbeat music)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we need to discuss weaknesses, starting with the app situation on the Vision Pro. The home screen features all your apps, but you can’t rearrange them—the arrangement is always alphabetical. This situation is evolving, and it will improve over time. But on launch day, there are merely 600 apps specifically made for the Vision Pro. While that initially sounds substantial, it isn't very impressive. Although millions of apps designed for the iPad are compatible, the sheer number of apps tailored for the Vision Pro falls short.\n",
      "\n",
      "The few available apps are remarkable in their creativity and unique approaches to utilizing the 3D space, but I genuinely believe that there are still more intriguing ideas about VR and AR experiences than actual apps. Again, don’t misconstrue my words—there are some excellent applications, as I've showcased in previous videos and continue to highlight. But have you seen that concept video of gamifying vacuum cleaning so that you effectively cover your entire floor like a game? It’s not an actual app, but if it existed, it’d be exciting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Or what about that enticing concept of watching an F1 race using Vision Pro, which overlays a virtual track into your space to track everything happening simultaneously? It looks genuinely better than the TV broadcast experience, yet it's still just a concept, lacking a real app. I want to watch an NBA game courtside in the Vision Pro too, but that experience seems to be non-existent as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple’s venture into this new domain unlocks endless creative possibilities for new AR and VR experiences, but it will be up to developers to bring those capabilities to life while working within the constraints of current technology. As of now, the lack of apps is a noticeable weakness of this first-gen product. There’s currently no YouTube app, no Netflix app, no Spotify app, and no TikTok app. I hope Apple can mend its relationship with these developers because securing those apps would significantly enhance this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "(upbeat music)\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not the only one saying this, but the Vision Pro isn’t the most comfortable headset, and I've figured out why. Most people have mentioned its weight, which is true; it weighs about 25% more than many other headsets. For context, the Quest 3 weighs approximately 515 grams, while the Vision Pro, constructed from metal and glass, weighs around 650 grams. It might seem like Apple disregarded weight, but I don't think that’s the case. If you examine the inside—tear-downs show it’s built with incredible efficiency, using carbon fiber, magnesium, and other lightweight materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, the added weight does make a difference between comfort and discomfort. The issue lies with the strap. The Solo Knit strap—promoted heavily in ads, shown on Apple's website, and present in Apple stores—looks sleek and innovative. I believe Apple, when entering the VR headset market, aimed to differentiate themselves, and that's how we ended up with this design. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, Dave2D pointed out in a recent video that many VR headsets tend to look cumbersome. This strap is much more stylish; it’s quick to adjust and less bothersome to your hair. Additionally, it features a user-friendly adjustment wheel outside for tightening the inner cables. It’s clear a lot of research and development went into making this strap iconic and functional—but, once worn, you tighten it against your face. It concentrates all that weight around two pressure points near your eyes and cheeks. The more you tighten it to minimize light leaks, the less comfortable it becomes. To sum up, it can be tough to wear for more than 30 to 45 minutes; I often need to take it off after that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, while it’s certainly not your neck causing discomfort, it’s the pressure on the front of your face. Apple recognizes this, which is why they’ve included a second band in the box, the dual-loop band. It's easy to swap out: just pop off the Solo Knit and attach the dual loop. \n",
      "\n",
      "While it’s not as visually appealing and can mess up your hair more, and adjusting it isn’t as simple as the Solo Knit, it’s designed for comfort. It resembles other VR headset straps aesthetically and is significantly more comfortable for longer wear. After participating in a two-hour episode of the \"Waveform Podcast\" while wearing the headset, I couldn't have done that with the Solo Knit strap due to its pressure. The dual-loop design supports the weight more evenly, taking it off your face and placing it on top of your head.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you plan to simply lend the headset for a brief five minutes, the Solo Knit band is great for quick adjustments. However, for extended usage, the dual-loop band is the way to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "(upbeat music)\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m uncertain if the external eyes on this headset are accomplishing what Apple intended. This issue likely stems from expectations about Vision Pro's future—potentially even see-through glasses down the line. Today’s technology isn’t ready to fully realize that ambition, so the closest we have is a lenticular display that simulates your eyes for outside viewers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite attempting to scan my eyes and others in the studio to test EyeSight, its visibility is poor. The smooth glass of the headset is too reflective, often scattering light in a way that makes your eyes hard to see. Even when visible, the resolution is low, making it feel less like actual eye contact, which significantly differs from the ads, particularly concerning darker skin tones. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve pondered whether Apple should double down on EyeSight for the next generation of Vision Pro or remove it entirely. Ultimately, I think it has to remain; it’s too iconic to remove. But with a potential \"Apple Vision\" down the line—an affordable version—will EyeSight still be featured? Only time will tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "(upbeat music)\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, when responding to those inquiries about what I truly think of the Vision Pro, I feel it's a really expensive, fun toy. This is an incredibly enjoyable gadget to experiment with, and I love watching content specifically created for the Vision Pro, trying out the latest games that utilize 3D space and hand controls. I’m thrilled about the idea of editing videos or watching movies on a massive screen on a plane while keeping my actions private from the person beside me. All of that is fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're considering buying one, I believe you'll enjoy all of these features too—but be aware that first-generation product symptoms are still very much present. It’s heavy, there’s a limited number of apps, battery life is mediocre, and the price is steep.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the larger question remains: Is Vision Pro destined for future success? The first-generation iPhone faced similar drawbacks—and yet look where we are now. The same applies to the Apple Watch and iPad. Nonetheless, one cannot merely correlate that just because other products had challenges and became successful, the same fate will befall this one. There must be elements within it that resonate with users, encouraging them to overlook its first-gen flaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "I genuinely think it offers that; it has a sci-fi aspect, an exciting nature to controlling things with your hands and moving windows throughout your space—something you’ve likely seen in certain movies. This headset exudes that energy. The desire for VR is well-known and universally appealing, indicating a demand even in this initial generation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Will the newfound attention on VR headsets draw focus to cheaper alternatives, like the $500 Quest 3? Absolutely. Just as will the developer buzz within this VR/AR space inspire a wealth of awesome applications that will enhance the overall value of this $3,500 first-gen headset. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, should you splurge on one if you're financially able and intrigued by a couple of appealing apps? Sure, go for it—it's your money. But I, too, am eagerly anticipating the next generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.\n",

      "All right, so the Tesla Cybertruck has been somewhat of an enigma. It was revealed nearly four years ago, and since then, it was relatively quiet. However, we gradually started seeing prototype Cybertrucks rolling around California and a few in Texas for testing. Interestingly, I had the opportunity to test one for a day. \n",
      "\n",
      "What we have here is a near-final version of the Tesla Cybertruck. It’s not a delivery-ready truck yet; it’s still in the testing phase. There are some minor prototyping elements still present, but everything I’m about to show you will be included in the customer delivery trucks starting now. \n",
      "\n",
      "During my time testing it, I've learned a lot about this truck. There are some surprising features that I think truck enthusiasts will really appreciate, but there are also a few concerns and surprises. Buckle up—this is going to be a comprehensive video. Make sure to subscribe; there’s a lot to cover. Let’s take a look at the Tesla Cybertruck.\n",
      "\n",
      "(upbeat music)\n",
      "(wipers squeaking)\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's get into the specs. Everyone wants to know the official numbers, the details on paper. Interestingly, some specifications have changed from the show truck that appeared on stage, including overall dimensions, which I’ll discuss shortly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The important details you probably care about are the basics: price, range, and speed. There will be three configurations of the Cybertruck. The version we’re looking at here is the triple motor version. It’s not quite the same as the Plaid powertrain, but it has two motors in the rear and one in the front. This setup allows it to go from zero to 60 mph in 2.7 seconds and complete a quarter-mile in 11 seconds. It boasts around 845 horsepower, features torque vectoring at the rear, and is often referred to as \"the beast.\" It’s a pretty ridiculous set of specs, making it the fastest production pickup truck currently available. \n",
      "\n",
      "There will also be a dual motor version that will start shipping soon, followed by a single motor rear-wheel drive version. The starting price for the triple motor variant is about $100,000, which is new information; we originally anticipated a lower launch price. Expect around $75,000 to $85,000 for the dual motor version, while the single motor will come later. The dual motor still offers over 600 horsepower, so it’s plenty fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the range, we’ll touch on the wheels shortly, but you can expect about a 340-mile maximum range for the most efficient version of the truck. \n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of other noteworthy numbers that truck enthusiasts might appreciate are towing and bed capacities. Tesla has communicated some of these: the tow capacity is around 2,500 pounds, which is impressive. We found that the vehicle is officially about 5% smaller in every dimension compared to the original prototype shown on stage. For instance, the overall length from bumper to bumper is about 224 inches. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also have an F-150 Lightning here for direct comparison. This truck is roughly the same size as the F-150 Lightning—just a little smaller. Speaking of the 5% decrease in dimensions, several aspects of this truck have changed since the original show car, including a motorized front trunk and various other features. \n",
      "\n",
      "One standout feature is the world’s largest windshield wiper, which I’m sure you’re curious about. The truck does indeed have removable side view mirrors. While it has to ship with these mirrors due to regulations, they can be taken off by users. There are also blind spot monitoring lights inside the truck, with cameras on the sides to give you a clear view of blind spots when signaling. \n",
      "\n",
      "These wheels feature removable aero caps. Starting with the premium tire on a 20-inch rim, this bespoke Goodyear tire has unique aesthetic and functional tweaks. The arrow cap is designed to improve range by a few percentage points, but if you’re not keen on the look or plan to go off-roading, you can easily remove it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Removing these arrow caps reveals a practical stock tire design. This two-piece structure is designed for functionality while also enhancing the truck's range. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can’t really talk about the Cybertruck without mentioning its unique design. It’s essentially a giant stainless steel triangle. There aren’t any significant curves on the truck; everything is made from large, flat pieces of stainless steel which gives it a distinctive aesthetic. However, this sharpness also leads to some edging concerns if you’re not careful around the sharp corners.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've looked at several Cybertrucks, and each one seems to have varying levels of build quality and panel gaps. The truck we’re examining here looks pretty great overall with generally even panel gaps. However, I can’t promise that every truck will match this level of precision. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s talk about the truck bed. The Cybertruck features a steeply sloped bed that, to me, resembles a dump truck. There's a dampened opening for the tailgate, although it isn’t power-operated, so you'll need to close it manually, but it does have a nice soft-close mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The powered tonneau cover is another exciting feature; it can support up to 300 pounds, so you could theoretically stand on it. The cover is motorized and operates surprisingly smoothly. When activated, it automatically reveals a rear window, which while not operational (it doesn’t move up and down), at least provides visibility from the cabin. However, when the tonneau cover is closed, rear visibility is completely blocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla also addressed concerns about the bed's design. While earlier prototypes featured a bare stainless steel bed, this version has a fully lined bed for durability. The official length of the bed measures around 66 inches, but measuring from my observation, I found it to be closer to 72 inches. There’s even a sub-trunk area that can fit a duffel or carry-on bag, plus it comes equipped with drain plugs for added functionality as a cooler.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truck also includes several power outlets: two 120-volt and one 240-volt outlet for charging devices or even another vehicle. I’m glad to see this trend of electric vehicles incorporating the ability to power other gadgets—great for utility and convenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention that there is a bottle opener positioned near one of the mounting points in the trunk as well. As for the tonneau cover, it features an interesting button mechanism: press it to open completely or hold it for a partial close, which I found out can be slightly temperamental.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the doors, there’s actually quite a bit to discuss here. The Cybertruck does not have traditional door handles, which is unusual. Instead, there’s an indented button you press to unlock the door, causing it to pop out slightly so you can easily grip it and pull open. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do have concerns about how these doors might function in adverse weather, particularly in cold or icy conditions. Tesla claims that if ice forms, you can press the button to break through it, though that’s yet to be tested in reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of materials, the cabin design continues the minimalist aesthetic with a lot of metal surfaces, which can reveal fingerprints quite easily. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the front of the Cybertruck, you’ll notice a couple of interesting features: a sturdy plastic bumper and two tow hitch rigs. It also has a front camera, a first for Tesla, which is particularly useful given the truck’s height.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s address the front trunk. It can be opened automatically, revealing a pretty shallow space. Interestingly, I haven’t seen a Tesla logo anywhere on this truck. Instead, it’s mostly branded with \"Cybertruck\" in welded text. While the front trunk size is comparable to fitting about two medium-sized suitcases, it’s a bit tight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of which, I can’t help but share how well my Ridge carry-ons fit inside; they’re designed with weather-resistance and a durable shell, making them ideal for travelers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let’s dive into the interior. The steering wheel looks more standard than before, which is an improvement. The oversized glass canopy stretches from the vehicle’s front all the way back, providing an impressive view and great visibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of storage, the Cybertruck features practical door storage, a large center console area with wireless charging capabilities, and a 65-watt USB-C port. The interior maintains a balanced look with functional aesthetics. It offers adjustable ambient lighting, an interior-facing camera, and a panoramic roof that adds to the spacious feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "One point worth mentioning is the gear selector is located above the steering column, a unique touch that I’ve never seen in any car model before. \n",
      "\n",
      "The backseat is surprisingly spacious, featuring a clever design that allows the rear seats to fold up for additional storage. The back also is equipped with a screen where passengers can control their environment and access various features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s shift to the driving experience. The 18.5-inch touchscreen center console is the largest in any Tesla, echoing the familiar setup yet revamped with a Cybertruck aesthetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The driving experience feels like the classic Tesla ride—instant throttle response and surprisingly agile despite its size. The truck’s handling is impressive, aided by rear-axle steering that allows for a tighter turn radius and nimble maneuverability, even in urban spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Cybertruck maintains a unique sense of character in how it feels to drive. With virtually no noise insulation, it’s quiet inside, thanks to its laminated windows. The vehicle feels solid and well-constructed, and though the off-road capabilities are promising, I plan to test them out further down the road.\n",
      "\n",

      "All right, I review a lot of products. At this point, I’ve talked about hundreds, maybe thousands of products. But for every video I’ve made, there are way more products out there in the world. The process of selecting which products to review is almost an art form in itself. Most products are just...meh. They exist and they’re fine, but they need to reach a certain level of interest or quality to be considered for a review, or sometimes they need to be really, really bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s been a lot of interesting discourse lately on this topic. A company receives some negative reviews and subsequently goes out of business, leading to the question: \"Do bad reviews kill companies, or do bad products?\" I have plenty of thoughts on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two prominent examples that have been discussed, especially on Twitter, are my reviews of the Fisker Ocean and the Humane AI Pin. The Fisker saga was pretty well documented, but in case you missed it, I reviewed a car and had a terrible experience with it. I documented and published my review on the Auto Focus channel, and a few months later, the entire company seemed to be on life support, possibly filing for bankruptcy soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Humane recently dropped their first product, the pin. I reviewed it, and my assessment wasn’t super positive. Many others are saying similar things, but I don’t think Humane is going anywhere. However, there is some simple logic we can apply to decipher the real danger for these companies: Do they still receive a bunch of negative reviews and die if the product is actually really good? \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s take a step back for a moment. What is a review? A little pet peeve of mine is that I think people misuse or overuse that word. A review is simply when someone uses a product and shares their impressions on whether they think it’s any good and how well it actually worked. If their honest opinion is that it’s good, that’s the review. If it’s bad, that’s the review. That’s basically it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been an advocate of good independent reviews for what feels like forever. But the thing is, if reviews aren’t honest, they’re basically useless. I strongly believe that everything stemming from a review—the consequences and the ecosystem around it—depends on the review being truthful and honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll share an example. Years ago, I reviewed the first Razer Phone when it was released. Razer, a gaming company, was getting into smartphones and made a phone targeting gamers. It had several upsides, like front-facing speakers and high refresh rates, but it also had downsides, such as a weak camera and a horrible vibration motor. I specifically remember calling out that the vibration motor was terrible. It sounded broken right out of the box. So, fast forward a year to the Razer Phone 2 briefing in New York City. The team showcased their new device, which had numerous improvements, including a better vibration motor. I tried it, and it was indeed much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s a big part of what reviews are about: honest feedback that leads to real action. Those who bought the first phone knew what they were getting into, and those who bought the second one benefited from the improvements. So, honesty is clearly important. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another aspect to consider is that these reviews are also for the people watching them. You may have been in a situation where you were about to purchase something and hopped on YouTube to check reviews to ensure you weren’t missing anything. That’s exactly how this YouTube channel started; my first tech video was reviewing a laptop I purchased with my allowance money in high school. I found a Windows Media Center remote in the PCI slot that hadn’t been mentioned in any other reviews, so I decided to create a video to inform others. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, not everyone watching reviews is necessarily considering buying the product. I often hear people say they watch reviews even if they aren’t planning to buy anything. Many viewers are looking for interesting, informative content. Each creator satisfies those viewers differently, which adds a layer of complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Returning to the original question, can a video kill a company? I’ll use the Fisker and Humane examples. The Fisker Ocean was a terrible car, and I genuinely couldn’t wait to be done driving it. It had a multitude of problems, bugs, missing features, and safety issues. I provided a fair assessment that served as a warning not to buy this poor-quality car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after my review, the company’s stock price plummeted to an all-time low, and they appeared to be headed for bankruptcy. The internet went wild, suggesting that my review killed the company. It’s a catchy headline, but I think it’s important to zoom out a bit. I wasn’t the only one reviewing the car; the stock had been in free fall for months before my video. Many other reviewers had also raised similar concerns over the car’s quality. \n",
      "\n",
      "If numerous reviewers highlight the same issues, that’s a good indicator of the honesty in their reviews. In the U.S., stocks can receive warnings if they fall below a dollar for a certain number of days in a row, and just before my video released, Fisker had received such a notice. If you’re an investor, that’s the kind of news that can seriously affect stock prices. I personally don’t pay attention to the stock price of any company whose product I review. My only focus is creating informative and honest video reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now fast forward to the Humane AI Pin. Like the Fisker Ocean, this pin has many unfulfilled promises. It doesn’t perform certain tasks well, has bad battery life, and overheats, among other issues. I tried to be as fair and informative as possible but was not about to sugarcoat or protect a company’s $700 product with a subscription model. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, some threads are surfacing, suggesting I harmed the company with my review. While it could be argued that my channel might have additional impact, I still advise zooming out. I wasn’t the first to cover the Humane Pin, nor the only one. When a product is as notable or poor as this one, many reviewers discuss their experiences and share notes. \n",
      "\n",
      "After reviewing a lot of bad products in my day—like the Dyson headphones, Red Hydrogen One, Pixel Slate, and HTC U Ultra—one thing has been consistently clear: bad reviews don’t kill companies without bad products being involved in the first place. I have immense respect for groups making new products. That’s the challenging part, and they create exciting things that could change the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, my reviews are not for those companies. Honest reviews simply accelerate what’s already happening. Thank you for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace. \n",

      "I really like these new Pixel phones. The new designs this year are obviously a highlight, but there are also new specs, new features, and even new issues to consider, along with updated price tags. So, let's dive into what’s genuinely good about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been hoping for a true flagship competitor from Google for a while now. On one hand, it feels like we finally got one, but on the other hand… Did you all catch the Google event announcing these devices? I feel like you can learn a lot about a company's confidence in its products just by watching the announcement event. It came across as more of a software showcase, with phones being an afterthought. This approach didn’t exactly inspire confidence in these new devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, after using these phones for two weeks straight, I can confidently share what’s good and what’s not.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I say these phones feel like flagships, I'm mainly referring to the hardware. It's easy to overlook the changes and think they’re just last year’s models squared, but there are several notable improvements. For instance, the screens are brighter: 2,700 nits for the Pixel 9 and 3,000 nits for the 9 Pro. The bezels have been evenly reduced, which required some design intricacies to wrap the OLED panels' edges under the corners. Additionally, there's a new ultrasonic fingerprint reader on all models, which is significantly faster and more reliable compared to the disappointing optical sensors of previous generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's just one small thing I wish for: the ability to unlock the phone at any time when the display is completely off. Currently, you need to have the always-on display activated, press the power button, or receive a notification before you can unlock with a quick touch. I wish the Pixel would allow unlocking directly from a blank screen, like Samsung phones do, where that area is always a hotspot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The haptics and buttons are also notably improved; they’re really nice and clicky this year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inside, we find the new Tensor G4 chip and added RAM. While the Tensor G4 isn’t drastically more powerful than last year’s chip—most users probably won't notice a difference for 99% of their daily tasks—what stands out is a new, more powerful NPU that's dedicated to AI. A significant portion of the RAM is reportedly reserved for AI tasks as well. I’ll dive into the AI features soon, but it's refreshing that along with the new AI capabilities, the Pixel has meaningful hardware upgrades too.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, the squared-off sides are definitely designed to compete with iPhones and Samsung devices. I’ve already mentioned that I like the aesthetics, including the new camera design, which resembles a shelf island more than a visor. It may look a bit odd in some renders, but trust me, in person, it’s appealing. It may collect dust like last year’s model, but it’s nice nonetheless. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m also pleased about the new size option, which offers a Pro phone without it being an XL variant. I love having that choice, even if I’m concerned it might not sell as well as the other two extremes. Still, I appreciate having different options available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, while there’s a lot to like, I do have a few gripes—after all, it's a $1,000 phone. The battery sizes are roughly the same as those from last year: 4,700 mAh for the smaller models and 5,000 mAh for the larger. I’ve experienced generally good battery life—around A-minus for the XL—consistently achieving five-plus hours of screen time even with heavy usage at higher brightness. However, the charging speed remains slow; the XL maxes out at about 37 watts, and the smaller models are even slower. I’m not suggesting we need absurd charging speeds like 320 watts from Realme, but it would be nice to see faster charging options, like 50 or 60 watts at a minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the Pixel 9 features matte sides with a glossy back, while the Pixel 9 Pro has glossy sides with a matte back. We've seen this approach before, but I personally prefer the feel of matte over glossy. I wish there was an option for a matte-on-matte design.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last point: the base model starts at $799, and for a $1,000 device, I think 256 GB of storage should be the standard rather than 128 GB. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cameras have long been a big part of the Pixel experience, and that remains true with the Pixel 9s, but not in the same way. Both the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro share the same primary camera and ultra-wide camera. The Pro model adds a 5X telephoto camera. The primary camera is essentially the same as last year's, while the ultra-wide is a new 48 megapixel sensor instead of 12, which significantly improves the quality. Shooting with these new cameras is great—the camera app is quick and easy to use, with various helpful modes that yield consistent, quality photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I notice that the photos still have an overly processed look. The Pixel’s signature style involves lots of HDR, contrast, dynamic range, and sharpening, which might not appeal to everyone. While this style is great for social media, some users may prefer a more neutral representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new selfie camera on the Pro is notably improved in terms of detail and color. The regular Pixel 9 doesn't have this upgrade, but the Pro's camera is impressive, providing a lot of dynamic range. If you’re curious about the video capabilities, I shot an entire video using the Pixel 9 Pro XL in 4K30 with just the built-in microphones. The videos look sharp but, again, they exhibit that signature processed look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Returning to the software experience, since Google is the creator of Android, you'd expect their phones to showcase the latest and greatest features. Yet, these devices launch with Android 14, even though the Android 15 preview was announced quite recently. So, they’re essentially shipping with the second latest version of the OS. They will, of course, receive updates for seven years, but it’s humorous that the latest model doesn’t launch with the latest software.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time I go back to using a Pixel, I'm reminded of the features I miss when using other devices. Call screening remains top-notch, and while Samsung has a version of it, it doesn’t quite match the Pixel's effectiveness. The Now Playing feature is another favorite, passively recognizing songs wherever you are.\n",
      "\n",
      "New features like Call Notes, which summarizes phone conversations and records them, are quite handy. I was initially skeptical about the new Pixel Weather app, but I found it to be just as reliable as any other Android weather app. It offers an aesthetically pleasing UI where you can rearrange tiles to prioritize information you care about.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also a new panorama UI in the camera. An interesting addition in the Pro model is a temperature sensor that can read people’s temperatures, which isn’t intended for medical use, but it’s an impressive feature nonetheless.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the center of the Pixel experience is Gemini, Google’s latest assistant integrated deeply into the phones. The boot-up animation transitions from the Google logo to the Gemini logo. Despite a history of confusing rebranding, Gemini is where the focus should be. I’ve found it to be highly useful, quickly improving with new capabilities and demonstrating conversational abilities while remembering context well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, Google Assistant still exists alongside Gemini on these phones, which can cause confusion given that it was often better at basic tasks at launch. For example, it couldn’t set timers or manage basic home controls initially, which further complicated user interactions. The Pixel home screen still defaults to Google Assistant, adding another layer of complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Gemini has improved, and now it can handle setting timers and alarms while running home controls, though its capabilities are still brand-marked with the old Google Assistant logo. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, settings now allow for Gemini extensions, giving it access to more personal data and making it more efficient in addressing user needs. The fully conversational mode also enables real-time conversations, answering questions and aiding in decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Gemini is promising, it’s essential to note that all these features can be used on any Android phone. Google even demonstrated its capabilities on a Galaxy S24 Ultra during their event. This raises questions about the unique benefits of the Pixel’s new NPU power and extra RAM dedicated to AI tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been exploring several new AI features present on the Pixel 9, categorizing my experiences into useful, meh, and gimmicky. Useful features include Gemini, Call Notes, Video Boost, and Add Me. Video Boost enhances video quality remarkably, while Call Notes can record, transcribe, and summarize conversations for your convenience. The Add Me feature is an interesting addition, allowing you to take pictures with yourself multiple times, though I wonder how frequently this will be utilized by users.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the \"meh\" side, we have AI-generated weather summaries and Magic Editor's Reimagine feature, which attempts to modify images. The Weather app's AI summaries might sometimes be helpful, but it also fell short in predicting weather changes effectively. Meanwhile, the screenshots app allows for the organization of captured images, yet I question whether this should have been integrated into Google Photos from the start.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, in the gimmick category, we have features like Zoom Enhance and the Pixel Studio app. The former aims to enhance photo clarity, but it tends to fall short in delivering real results. The Pixel Studio app generates images, which can be fun, but I find it lacks practical applications outside of playful experimentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the general narrative for new smartphones in 2024 seems to be minor improvements alongside flashy AI features exclusive to the latest models. If you’re looking for a device that excels in AI capabilities while also providing a pleasant hardware experience, the Pixel 9 is a strong contender. \n",
      "\n",
      "What are your thoughts? Are there features you think you’d genuinely use or find valuable? Let me know in the comments. Overall, I’d say the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro represent some of Google’s finest work yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, huge thanks to Anker for sponsoring this video. Their new Anker Prime lineup features an advanced multi-device fast charger, with several products including charging stations, wall chargers, power banks, and cables. The few that stand out the most to me are the Anker Prime charging station and power bank, both of which offer impressive charging capabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s all for now. I’m glad I got this in before the rain started! Let me know your thoughts in the comments below. Talk to you in the next one. Peace!\n",

      "So, this is the Apple Watch Ultra. It was introduced at the top of the Apple Watch lineup for a premium price, primarily to accommodate a much larger battery in a smartwatch, but also to offer a few extra rugged features for enthusiasts willing to invest the extra money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this is the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, added to the top of the Galaxy Watch lineup for a similar premium price, serving the same purpose of fitting a bigger battery into a smartwatch while providing additional rugged features for those willing to spend the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, there have been many copies before, in both directions. Samsung often copies Apple, and Apple returns the favor. However, this particular instance is so pronounced that it’s hard to overlook. There has been a lot of online chatter about how the new Galaxy Watch Ultra is a copycat product of the Apple Watch Ultra. And yes, it's true—it really is.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I've said this before, and I'll say it again: I actually don’t mind when these products and companies copy each other. As long as they're copying the good stuff, we, the customers, still win. This time, Samsung copied so many features that it went a step too far and imitated an additional aspect that I think ultimately hurt its case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s take a look at the similarities. First of all, they share the same name and general concept. As I mentioned, this is the Watch Ultra. It's positioned at the top of the lineup and is the most expensive. They have also matched the Apple Watch Ultra's durability specs; both are made of titanium, are water-resistant to 100 meters, and feature sapphire glass over their displays. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the basic on-paper specs, both have dual-frequency GPS for high accuracy, extra bright displays for outdoor visibility (actually both peaking at 3,000 nits), and come with three default bands. The Apple Watch Ultra has an Ocean Band, a Trail Loop, and an Alpine Band. In contrast, Samsung's Watch Ultra launches with three different bands: a Marine Band (instead of an Ocean Band), a Trail Band, and a Peakform Band. \n",
      "\n",
      "You could say that the Ocean Band and Marine Band are a bit like asking, \"Can I copy your homework, but change it a little so it’s not too obvious?\" They didn’t really change it up enough, but it’s still acknowledged with a \"Okay, sweet, thanks.\" They even have two holes on theirs instead of one—because not every marine is an ocean, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Each watch has three buttons. You might recall that the Apple Watch added a special orange button on the side called the Action Button, which can be mapped to various functions, with a workout selector as the default. The Galaxy Watch Ultra features its own orange button on the side called the Quick Button, which can also be customized for different actions, starting with a workout selector as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The similarities continue in the software. This specific watch face that Samsung uses heavily in its marketing borrows considerable inspiration from Apple’s flagship watch face, featuring complications around the corners. There’s also a monochrome Night Mode version, which was introduced with the Apple Watch Ultra. Changing the watch face is done the same way on both: just hold down the face for a moment, swipe over, and you can customize the complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "They both utilize a blob of icons to scroll through apps, and they even incorporated a double-pinch gesture. This was a recent feature introduced by Apple, which is now operational on Samsung’s watch as well. It’s off by default, but when activated, it functions similarly.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see, Samsung has lifted numerous features from the Apple Watch Ultra. Some have labeled it shameless, calling it pure copycat behavior, and there are endless comments online regarding this. There is, however, one aspect that Samsung copied that I genuinely have a problem with.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you first look at the Galaxy Watch Ultra, you could argue that it looks mostly different from the Apple Watch. While both have an orange button, Samsung implemented a unique design. It maintains a fully circular watch face but has a larger, more robust titanium body underneath, which I refer to as a cushion design. It feels definitely bigger than the Apple Watch Ultra, which was already rather substantial. However, in the grand scheme of watches, it’s not actually huge, especially since the screen size is akin to that of a large Watch7.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had hoped that, with the retaining of the circular screen, they would include a physically rotating bezel, similar to the beloved feature on the Watch6 Classic. It was a feature everyone desired, yet they chose not to feature it at all. The Galaxy Watch Ultra relies purely on touchscreen functionality, which may not seem like a significant issue at first. However, considering this is a fitness watch for active users, it becomes problematic in workout scenarios. Touchscreens can often be affected by sweat, sleeves, gloves, and wet conditions, making them challenging to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rotating crown for navigation would have provided a distinct advantage over the Apple Watch Ultra in this fitness-focused context, but they opted not to include it. If asked, I’m sure Samsung would justify their choice by stating that a rotating bezel is a moving part and wouldn’t endure the military-grade certification of the rest of the watch. The watch claims an 810H military certification for surviving tougher drops and resisting dust and extreme temperatures, meaning a moving part wouldn’t align with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, I believe Samsung should have gone for the rotating bezel anyway. I think 99% of users would prefer that feature over military certification, while the 1% who wouldn’t could choose a Garmin or something different. Overall, I think this adjustment would have enhanced this particular watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there are a few other factors that distinguish this watch, primarily that it’s geared towards Android users rather than iPhone users—that’s number one. Wear OS performs really well; there were initial concerns about it not being smooth, but I’ve found it to be great. It’s very customizable and functional. The full-size keyboard is actually easier to type on due to larger letters, and symbols require accessing a secondary menu. I find I can type words quite efficiently on this compared to other smartwatches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best part, though, is that the battery life has lived up to its claims. It can be a bit confusing with the varying claims of 60 hours, 100 hours in Power-Saving Mode, and 48 hours in Exercise Power-Saving Mode. However, I’ve found that it often matches and sometimes even exceeds the battery life of the Apple Watch Ultra, typically giving around a 25% better standby time. With light use—like receiving text messages or doing a couple of workouts—you can easily stretch this watch into two full days. Under heavier use, such as frequent workouts, the duration is comparable, but it still offers about a solid day and a half, especially with the usage of the 3,000-nit Super AMOLED display. That’s impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, it's evident that Samsung has copied many aspects of the Apple Watch Ultra. However, as I've previously stated, if you're going to emulate the good features, you can end up with an excellent product, shameless inspiration notwithstanding. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, Samsung updated the Watch7 simultaneously. That model also offers dual-frequency GPS, the same screen size, a slightly smaller battery, sapphire crystal on top, three sporty bands, and is half the price. This makes it harder to recommend the Galaxy Watch Ultra given its similarities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is just a Galaxy Watch for those who desire a larger battery and a few more rugged features, but only if you’re willing to spend $650 on it. I believe that including the rotating bezel would have made it easier to justify and distinguish this device from its more affordable counterpart. For now, this Samsung product leans more heavily on its inspiration than I would have liked, and it certainly won't be the last instance from either side.\n",
      "\n",

      "All right, now that we're back down to Earth after all the Vision Pro launch excitement, I've had a chance to revisit some of the devices I was testing that got interrupted by that chaotic week, and there's some really impressive stuff. I really like the design of the OPPO Find X7 Ultra more than I expected. The Zenbook Duo, a full screen, dual screen laptop for 2024, is kind of amazing. There are a few other devices that surpassed my expectations as well. But the one that stood out to me the most is this guy right here, the OnePlus 12.\n",
      "\n",
      "This phone may have flown a bit under the radar with everything going on, but it comes with some nice improvements from last year and is priced very competitively. In fact, let's start with that: it retails for $799. Plus, if you pre-order, you get a free upgrade to the 16GB RAM and 512GB storage model at that price. It's already marked down to that on Amazon, so I’ll have a link below. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, while it does carry a flagship price, it's competing against some ultra phones that are priced at $1,000, $1,200, or even $1,300. So, suddenly, you could call it a flagship killer.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the outside, it looks nearly the same as last year’s model. They found a design they like and decided to keep it consistent. The shapes, the camera bump that seamlessly integrates into the side, and the Gorilla Glass 5 on the back are all familiar. There are new colors and textures, but in general, you'd be forgiven for thinking it's almost identical to last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, don’t let that fool you; the biggest noticeable physical difference is up front. This screen is much brighter, reaching up to 1,600 nits under sunlight and achieving an impressive peak HDR brightness of 4,500 nits. It’s incredibly readable outdoors and in any lighting scenario. It can also get extremely dim, which I appreciate. However, I’m not a fan of the curved edges—it leads to light fall-off and extra reflections. Still, from corner to corner, this 6.8-inch, 1440p LTPO Pro XDR display is a significant upgrade from last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the upgrades to this phone consist of several small changes that combine to create a noticeable improvement overall. That's what smartphones have become. I remember reviewing the OnePlus 1, then the OnePlus 2 the following year, and observing the dramatic changes between the two. Nowadays, it's about stacking clever little enhancements to make user experience as good as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be a flagship killer, you need the newest chip, so this phone comes with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. While you might not notice a massive difference when compared side by side to a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 phone, this device features significantly improved cooling. As a result, it offers a bit of headroom for slightly boosted clock speeds, and its benchmarks fall right in line with gaming phones and the S24 Ultra. This means, in real-world use, the OnePlus 12 feels super fast and incredibly fluid—it’s a consistently smooth experience. OnePlus has excelled at this for quite some time, even keeping high performance mode off by default in the battery settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of battery, this phone prioritizes long battery life over ultra-high performance. So, it has excellent battery longevity. First off, it has a massive battery capacity, now equipped with a 5,400 milliamp hour battery, one of the largest in a OnePlus flagship. You can be sure they kept their signature Super Fast Charging as well. It features a split battery design (dual 2,700 milliamp hours) and can charge at 80 watts wired. This combination of huge battery capacity, exceptional longevity, and ultra-fast charging makes this phone a strong contender for battery champ of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you leave the phone at its default settings—regular performance mode at 1080p with auto frame rate—you can get two full light days out of it. When the battery dips close to zero, it can charge to half in just 12 minutes. If you want a full charge, it takes about half an hour. It’s incredibly convenient. Additionally, it supports wireless charging up to 50 watts, although you'll need to buy an appropriate charger separately. The OnePlus 11 didn’t have wireless charging at all, making this a big step forward. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do wish for Qi2 support for wireless charging, but it seems to be having a rocky start this year, with very few phones actually supporting Qi2's magnetic features. This likely stems from a 15-watt charging limit with Qi2; if you want fast wireless charging, this phone doesn’t offer that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yes, no Qi2 support or magnets, but you do get very rapid charging alongside a better display, improved chip, and enhanced battery. The cameras have also seen an upgrade. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be honest, though—cameras have been a weak point for OnePlus's top-tier phones for a while now. We’ve wanted to label them as flagship killers, but strong camera capabilities are crucial in flagship phones, and OnePlus hasn't matched the highest standards yet. The camera system on this phone is now acceptable for flagship level, but it still has room for improvement. \n",
      "\n",
      "The main sensor is slightly different; it features the LYT-808 sensor instead of the LYT-T808 with two additional megapixels and a slightly wider aperture. That said, the OnePlus 12 photos won’t blow you away. I’ve done some side-by-side comparisons. The photos turn out pretty good most of the time; they’re sharp and have a bit more contrast than the OnePlus Open. The HDR effect is decent but falls short in challenging conditions, especially in low light.\n",
      "\n",
      "For context, we previously tested the OnePlus Open in a blind smartphone camera comparison with 20 of the best smartphone cameras in the world. In that test, the OnePlus Open did quite well, ranking third in standard light photos and also breaking the top 10 in portrait mode. In low light, however, it ranked fifth from the bottom, just below the Razr.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while this new camera system comes with new hardware—like the updated zoom—it’s still not leagues ahead of its competitors; it’s just a slight improvement over last year’s model. This will suffice for many users, but if you’re looking for a flagship-level camera, there’s still some catching up to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are a ton of nice little features in this OnePlus phone that add to the overall experience. For instance, I love that I can force any app I want to run at whatever frame rate I choose. Unlike many other phones, the mapping apps like Waze and Google Maps often default to 60Hz, but on this phone, I can set them to 120Hz. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also appreciate the infrared blaster—a rather uncommon feature in modern smartphones, akin to a headphone jack. This allows you to control appliances remotely, like TVs, without needing to find the remote. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the USB-C port supports incredibly fast charging and data transfer speeds, being a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. This means you can transfer large files quickly with the right cable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the new screen supports high PWM dimming, which is great for those sensitive to flickering on OLED displays when at low brightness. The phone flickers on and off to achieve lower perceived brightness at an incredibly high frequency (2,160 Hz in this case), making it smooth at all brightness levels. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you use your phone in the rain, you know how frustrating it can be with touch sensitivity problems. However, this phone features Aqua Touch technology, which allows it to remain responsive even with water on the screen. While it’s not perfect, it works significantly better than other phones, allowing me to type on the wet screen with ease—it’s very impressive!\n",
      "\n",
      "Other nice touches include 12 or 16 GB of fast RAM, Dolby Atmos with spatial audio support, and great haptics. All these small details culminate in a fantastic user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, it's not perfect—no phone really is. Some downsides include the continued use of a curved display, which may enhance the phone's character but comes with its own set of challenges, from glare to durability concerns. The fingerprint sensor still feels like a relatively average optical sensor that hasn't seen much improvement in years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite having the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, this phone doesn’t come with many new AI features, which is a missed opportunity. Qualcomm announced new AI capabilities with their new chips, but this phone seems to have skipped that aspect. The only AI feature I found was in the photo editor—a color overlay labeled AI Palettes—but it doesn’t feel very AI-driven. So, no generative fill, crop correction, or various other useful new features that other flagships are implementing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also encountered a strange bug: when using the overlay browser and interacting with my favorite alert slider, it opens a search box every time. They shouldn’t be connected, but it happens consistently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the biggest downside compared to other flagships is the promise of fewer years of software update support. I’ve already received a major software update since testing began, which included camera enhancements and bug fixes. However, OnePlus is only promising four years of software updates and five years of security updates. While that’s adequate for users who plan to keep a phone for three to five years, it falls short when compared to competitors like Google, Samsung, and Apple, which offer six to seven years of updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, is this a flagship killer? It depends on your definition of a flagship. The most compelling aspect of this phone is likely its competitive pricing. For instance, I’ve seen the 16GB RAM and 512GB model for $899, but pre-orders allow you to get it for $799. Some places even advertise it for $699 with a $100 trade-in discount on any phone, regardless of condition. If you can snag it for $699 while competing with phones that start at $1,300, that’s a solid deal!\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, you should consider what’s most important to you. If the camera is a top priority or if long-term software updates matter significantly, or if AI features are particularly appealing, you may want to explore other flagship options. However, for overall performance, display quality, exceptional battery life, and extremely fast charging, this phone may be better than you anticipate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, OnePlus has also released the OnePlus 12R around the same time. It looks almost identical but is a more budget-friendly version, cutting some corners on the camera and using the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 instead of the Gen 3. It lacks wireless charging and is rated IP64 instead of IP65. It’s a trimmed-down version priced around $500. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if the OnePlus 12 wasn’t on your radar, it should be, along with its budget-friendly counterpart. Thanks for watching, and catch you in the next one. Peace.\n",

      "- New intro.  \n",
      "And there’s new tech coming. I mean, there’s always new tech, but what better time to lay it all out than the beginning of the year for some of the best stuff we’re expecting in 2024?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there was plenty of great tech in 2023: from smartphones to cameras, VR gadgets, computers, headphones, a bunch of good EVs, and even better EV promises. But 2024 is looking promising. So here are the most interesting new tech items I believe we can look forward to this upcoming year.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, right at the start of every year is CES in January, out in Las Vegas. This year, again, I will not be there in person, but I will have my eyes on it, hoping to see if anything interesting bubbles up above the rest of the noise. I can always count on you guys to send me that stuff on Twitter if you see anything.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Typically kicking off the year with a bang is a January Samsung event, so we’re expecting S24 reveal information pretty soon. Based on the leaks, it looks like the S24 family will look very similar to the S23. I’m curious to see what changes they actually make.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But the big headliner that seems to be right around the corner is the Apple Vision Pro. This feels like maybe the most unprecedented Apple launch in a long time, certainly in my career online. Love them or hate them, Apple is one of the biggest tech companies in the world, and their decision to launch something so unusual is pretty fascinating.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They’ve shown it on stage, released that announcement video, and announced it months ahead of time, but they haven't shown a single Apple employee or executive wearing it even once. Although they’ve let people test this thing out, including myself on several occasions, nobody has been allowed to film themselves using it. There are still many unanswered questions about how it’s going to work, what it's really good at, and what you'll want to use it for. Will you have to visit an Apple store for a custom fit to buy one of these devices? It’s shaping up to be one of the most interesting new products in a long time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We all know it’s super expensive — $3,500. It’s definitely not for everyone. Most people I know don’t even plan on getting one, but it will appeal to early adopters curious about VR. Those who do try it will likely be impressed by the incredible pass-through capability, the immersion, and the high resolution. The eye-tracking feels borderline magical.  \n",
      "\n",
      "However, it seems challenging to review, as it doesn't really compete with other VR headsets since it’s so much more expensive. This raises a weird question: how can it have no competition? It’s just fascinating. If you want to revisit my initial impressions after trying the Apple Vision Pro on the day it was announced, I’ll link that video below.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe this headset is technically impressive for those who try it. But the other half of the story remains unwritten. What apps will come out for it? What features and use cases will show that the Apple Vision Pro excels? I imagine wearing it on an airplane to watch a movie during a four-hour flight, but it’s heavy, so I’m unsure if I’d want to wear it that long. Plus, will the battery actually last that long? There are many questions and not a lot of answers yet, so I’m looking forward to that this year.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But you know what I have almost no doubt about? I’m calling it now: remember the word “multimodal.” This is going to be the year of multimodal AI in 2024. We’ve seen so much focus on AI in the past couple of years, mainly revolving around chatbots that take text input and provide text output.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we’re starting to see what’s called multimodal AI, which means it can process multiple types of input — text, audio, images, or video — and provide a cohesive output. Recently, Google got into trouble for a video that showed their new multimodal Gemini Ultra AI model responding to a series of questions about objects placed on a table. The video was heavily edited, but the idea of that kind of interaction is exciting to me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I look forward to a multimodal Google Assistant, whenever that happens. I also did a short video about Meta’s AI smart glasses, which have a camera and a multimodal AI model that assists the user by looking at things. Multimodal AI is definitely a concept to remember moving forward.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This doesn’t even account for all the non-consumer-facing aspects of AI, such as finding patterns in vast data sets, predicting and controlling wildfires, inventing new materials, or curing diseases. What a world we live in!  \n",
      "\n",
      "- We truly live in an age of wonders.    \n",
      "\n",
      "New hardware is always exciting, right? New phones, tablets, computers — all that stuff. Here’s something interesting: not a single new iPad was released in 2023. Makes you think.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Apple tends to make amazing hardware changes to the iPad Pro occasionally. I think the iPad Pro is genuinely one of the most impressive pieces of tech I’ve ever used. They do that every year or two, but in the end, it’s still just an iPad.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I say this with hesitation, but I am actually really looking forward to seeing the rumored new OLED iPad Pro in 2024. That’s something we’ve been hearing about for a while. Currently, we have the OLED S8 Ultra — that tablet looks amazing. I want to see a super bright OLED display on an iPad. We’ll see if that shows up soon.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Another interesting design change we’re expecting from Apple is the Watch 10, the 10th generation Apple Watch. All signs point toward a truly redesigned Apple Watch for the first time in a long time. Let’s be real: the Apple Watch has looked about the same for ages. Yes, the Ultra is a little bigger and flatter, but Series 9 looks just like Series 8, which looks just like Series 7, Series 6, and Series 5. They’re all the same shape, with just minor bezel reductions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Change for the sake of change isn’t particularly useful, but I think the Apple Watch could actually use a refresh to catch up with Galaxy Watches. Nice circles might be a refreshing look. Also, have you heard that the Apple Watch is dangerously close to being banned in the U.S.? That could be worth a separate video. Stay tuned for more on that.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and RCS on the iPhone! I’m excited for RCS to finally come to the iPhone sometime in 2024. They haven’t specified when, but Apple’s committed to it. I usually don’t root for tech to fail, but it’s time to be done with SMS forever. Welcome aboard!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here’s a more general thought: I hope we see some genuinely interesting smartphones this year. I realize that's a slightly crazy ask since smartphones are kind of mature, looking similar year after year, and even folding ones are beginning to look alike. But I think this is a ripe time for a new mid-range smartphone that tries something truly innovative. It might not happen, but I’m hoping for it in 2024.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I’ve mentioned before that every year for the next 15 years is destined to be interesting for electric cars, and I don’t think 2024 will be any exception. We already have solid EVs available, with the most popular new car being an EV. Plus, the NACS port has garnered numerous commitments from nearly all electric car manufacturers, meaning Tesla Superchargers will be available to many more vehicles.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the upcoming year, we already have Tesla Cybertrucks hitting the streets — that’s pretty crazy. We also expect a Model 3 and Model Y refresh very soon. The Model 3 refresh is already shipping in Europe and Asia, and it should be in the U.S. shortly. Stay tuned to the Auto Focus channel for an in-depth look at those.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We recently saw a fresh Porsche Taycan drop a crazy Nürburgring lap time, making it a competitor to the Model S Plaid at the high end. We should also see more affordable EVs over the next few years. Plus, we’ll have hybrids for those not ready to go fully electric. This should result in one of the most interesting years yet for automotive tech, and I’m excited for that.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, I’m also hoping to see significant strides in other tech areas this year. I wanted to wrap up by mentioning some of the videos I’m most looking forward to. Last year, there were over 70 new videos on this channel, all super fun. I have a threshold for what I consider a certified hit — when people mention these videos to me in real life. A few really stood out: the Tesla Solar Roof video, the Tesla Cybertruck video, Apple Vision Pro, and the Formula 1 explain video.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I especially enjoyed the Formula 1 explain video because that sport is incredibly high-tech, but I also think there's a lot of other tech in various sports worth highlighting. This could be in the sport itself, in training, or in broadcasting. Think of those highlight moments in a tennis match where the slow-mo camera captures the ball just on the line and the instant replay. There are also elements in football and baseball, like the line of scrimmage or the pitch count.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My point is that I’m probably making sports tech videos in 2024 since I had such a good time with those and am keenly interested. I also want to focus more on collaborations in general. I’ve enjoyed the \"Waveform\" podcast, so if you haven’t subscribed there, check the link below. We host guests regularly, and those conversations are valuable.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I’d love collaborations with others on YouTube too, so if you have suggestions for channels you’d like to see us collaborate with, please leave a comment below. Additionally, there are a few top-secret projects we’ve been working on that will finally launch in 2024. You’ll know them when you see them — big announcements are coming. Stay tuned here, on Twitter, and everywhere else for that. I’ve included subtle Easter eggs for the two biggest projects in this video. Once they are announced, you’ll catch on.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, look forward to all that this year! I’m wrapping it up here. Thanks for watching, and see you in 2024 — starting now. Peace!\n",

      "So this is Cleo, and as you can probably tell, Cleo is an awesome dog. She’s one of the nicest dogs I’ve ever met. She loves people and anyone who will give her food. She exhibits all the classic dog traits, and she also happens to be missing her right leg. Cleo was found on Petfinder after spending some time as a stray in Oklahoma with injuries from unknown causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "While playing with Cleo, you'd almost forget she's missing a leg because she runs around, chases things, and loves to play fetch. She enjoys being outdoors, embodying typical dog behavior. However, although she appears super healthy now, pets missing limbs, including dogs, are more likely to develop conditions like arthritis and joint problems in their other limbs later in life since they compensate for the missing limb. While Cleo is thriving now, it’s ideal for her long term to receive proper support, which is where a company called 3D Pets comes in.\n",
      "\n",
      "They reached out to me to share their high-tech solution to this issue, and I was excited to see it. This story, like many others, highlights how technology is intertwined in so many aspects of life. Even my initial assumptions about the use of tech in helping dogs like Cleo were exceeded by what I learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process is multi-step. First, a pet comes into their studio, located in New Jersey, where they use a smartphone to 3D scan the animal. They take several scans using either the iPhone's LIDAR scanner, the true depth camera system, or both. This isn’t exactly the intended use for those devices, but with apps like Combed and Hedges, it turns out to be a clever solution for measuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Cleo holds still long enough, they can achieve a reasonably accurate scan of her dimensions, including how high off the ground she is, how her prosthesis needs to be shaped, and other specifications. All of this information is utilized in the next step: 3D printing the prosthesis, which is incredible.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, I questioned why so much technology was involved in this process and why they were 3D scanning the animal to then 3D print the prosthesis. The explanation is that every animal's circumstances are unique. No two are the same, whether due to the reason for limb loss or variations in size, shape, and weight-bearing capacity. Each animal is almost like a fingerprint. Therefore, it's impossible to mass-produce a one-size-fits-all prosthetic. The goal is to make the prosthesis as custom, bespoke, and comfortable for each animal as possible. The 3D printing process allows for rapid iterations, enabling them to create multiple versions until they achieve the perfect fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "3D Pets has collaborated with over 300 animals so far at their studio. They start with a candidacy form on their website, and once approved, they have a variety of options. While many of their clients are dogs, they have also worked with ducks, a tortoise, a pig, and even a goat that was missing part of its skull. They created a helmet for that goat, as well as a prosthetic leg for an elephant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleo's scan was relatively straightforward, and within five minutes, they had several accurately modeled designs to work from, which they then imported into the design software. The next step is to get the scan from the phone onto their web portal, allowing them to bring it into custom design software, where the magic really happens. This software enables them to mold the design to the specific 3D scan of each pet, ensuring a perfect fit for Cleo.\n",
      "\n",
      "They overlay Cleo's scan to patch things up as necessary, which is similar to using 3D Photoshop. They can adjust the lattice structure, hardware mounts, and strap placements tailored for Cleo. Once they’re satisfied with the design, they transfer it to another software for optimization before printing. This involves fine-tuning the intricacies and details of each layer, determining where they need rigidity for hardware mounts and where flexibility is needed for comfort around vital areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once everything is finalized, they take it over to one of their several 3D printers, which vary in size depending on the case and the animal's needs. After the design is printed—literally about 24 hours later—the final step includes sanding down the corners to ensure comfort. They also remove support pieces used in 3D printing and are working on ways to repurpose those materials for other uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, one of the dogs they helped has a residual limb, so they strategically positioned the prosthesis to maintain weight-bearing below where the limb used to be. They employ a sanding and torching method to smooth the material, making it comfortable. One of their specialties is the design of prosthetic feet, which must compress to absorb the dog's weight as they step. They continuously iterate on their designs based on feedback, such as adjusting the foot design for greater durability.\n",
      "\n",
      "After designing Cleo’s prosthesis, it was time for the final fitting. What I didn’t realize is that you don’t just attach the prosthesis and expect the dog to immediately run around as if it’s been there their whole life. There’s an adjustment process to help the dog become accustomed to it. I watched Cleo learn in real-time how to trust her new leg. The adjustment involves gradually increasing the time she spends using it daily, starting with 20 minutes, then an hour, and so on. By the end of the process, she learns to rely on it fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "This experience was eye-opening for me, showcasing a remarkable win for pets like Cleo. It’s also fascinating that this technology is accessible, utilizing devices we already have like smartphones, along with software and 3D printers. 3D Pets began their venture with this combination and have since helped numerous animals. They are now considering the possibility of remotely creating prostheses for pets that can’t visit the studio in person by sending a mold instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I'm not an expert on 3D printing or prosthetics, I hope this knowledge aids more animals in extending their lives and enjoying greater freedom. These prostheses typically range from a couple of hundred dollars to about $2,000 and ideally last a lifetime, provided the pet has stopped growing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, thanks to 3D Pets for sharing their innovative approach and technology, to Cleo for letting me hang out all day, and to you for watching. See you in the next one! Peace.\n",

Working on a new app that we are finally launching. You guys have always been asking me where I get my wallpapers. It's frequently the number one suggested search result under my name, and has been for years. So now we’ve put them all in one place. It’s called Panels. And it’s finally live in the App Store, both on iOS and Android. Feels really good to be able to say that. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you’re wondering where the wallpaper on these phones in the review came from, Panels. If you’re curious about the wallpaper in the last video, Panels. In fact, almost all of the wallpapers on the devices and backgrounds you’ve seen in my videos for the past year have come from Panels, which is pretty amazing. We have a bunch of awesome artists involved, and we're splitting profits 50-50. There’s already a ton of great art collections available, with much more on the way. We have some pretty big plans for this app.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s starting off as a wallpaper app now. I don’t want to overpromise, but it’s going to consistently improve over time, which is part of the reason we're offering a subscription to support it. So go pick it up now. Explore, find your new favorite wallpaper or artist, and let me know what you think. It’s kind of fun to be on the other side now, on the development side, where other people are going to review what we create, which is always exciting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, the trend with new smartphones these days is that there are a bunch of incremental hardware improvements along with a ton of AI features being added, which provide the real value. While they’re a little late to the game, Apple has also entered this phase with the iPhone, whether we like it or not. The iPhone 16 is a minor update over the 15, but it comes with a lot of new AI features branded as Apple Intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, much of that isn't available yet, which is a little awkward given that basically all of the marketing for this phone revolves around Apple Intelligence.

But none of that is present on this phone, none of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only way to reconcile the current state of this phone with everything Apple has advertised is to consider it unfinished. This is the most unfinished launch of a new iPhone I’ve ever seen. Until we actually have all the Apple Intelligence features, we are left with a very incremental upgrade cycle. (cheerful music)\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s not a lot that’s physically new with this year’s iPhone, but it’s not nothing. The iPhone 16 looks a little different from the iPhone 15. There was a time not long ago when Apple removed the headphone jack, sparking speculation about removing all ports and buttons. Instead, they’ve added the action button from last year’s Pro models and a new button called Camera Control, which we’ll get to in a moment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aesthetically, there are some vibrant new colors and slightly larger camera bumps on the back of the phone. I know everyone puts a case on their phone, so this may not seem significant, but I think this is the wobbliest slab phone I’ve ever encountered—or at least, that I can remember. Regardless, the general shape, flat sides, and dimensions of this phone are quite familiar. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Pro models are even harder to distinguish from one another, but they do feature new displays that are great. They’re slightly bigger, measuring 6.3 and 6.9 inches respectively. The bezels are noticeably thinner and even all around. Both sized phones are a little larger than last year and accommodate bigger batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s talk about batteries. When Apple unveiled these new phones, they highlighted the slightly larger capacity batteries across the board and claimed that the new Pro Max would offer the longest battery life ever in an iPhone. I would hope that your newest, most expensive, and largest phone would have the longest battery life, but they didn’t provide any numbers to support that.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t actually know how much larger the battery is in milliamp-hours or how much longer it lasts. All I have is Apple’s website comparison tool, which measures video playback hours. It states that the iPhone 16 supports 22 hours of video playback, an increase from 20 hours, while the 16 Pro Max boasts 33 hours compared to last year’s model at 29 hours. Unfortunately, this means almost nothing to me, as video playback can be optimized with cores on a chip—who cares?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the phones are out and people have tested them, it turns out the batteries are about 6% larger across the board and 9% larger in the Pro models. Personally, I’ve found the battery life to be about the same as last year—not noticeably better or worse. It lasts me a whole day with heavy use on the Pro without any issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "What did make a difference to me, though, is the faster charging. Fewer people are talking about this, but all models in the iPhone 16 lineup now support up to 45-watt wired charging. Apple never promotes fast charging or boasts about going from 0% to 100% or 0% to 80%, but when their phones get slightly faster at charging, it’s really nice. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s unfortunate that it doesn’t come with a fast charging brick in the box. I have a fast charger and I’m really enjoying the new fast charging in bursts. Additionally, MagSafe supports up to 25-watt wireless charging instead of the previous 15. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the phones are the A18 and A18 Pro chips. I’d be lying if I said I noticed any difference right out of the box, and I think most people would agree. Yes, they will benchmark 10%, 20%, or 30% faster depending on the task, but the extra power is mostly geared toward fringe activities and future-proofing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was actually more interested to find that all of the models now come with eight gigs of RAM, which is unusual since the Pro and non-Pro phones typically have different amounts. No doubt this is due to the Apple Intelligence features, which, when they eventually arrive, will require every last bit of it. But for now, you can enjoy more RAM for all your other apps as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "iOS 18 launched alongside these new phones, and I made an entire separate video detailing the new features. This update is also rolling out to everyone’s older iPhones. You can now place your home screen icons wherever you like, color them, and change lock screen shortcuts, allowing for more customization than ever before. You could argue that this newfound personalization makes a bigger difference than any of the hardware changes. \n",
      "\n",
      "But speaking of new hardware, there’s one more new button. (energetic music) \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess nobody at Apple is allowed to call it a button, but I’m calling it a button. This is the new Camera Control button present on all the new iPhone 16s. I’ve used and thought a lot about this button. My perspective is that smartphone cameras are like headphones' EQ. You get a new pair of headphones, listen to them, and if you don't like the sound, you don’t have to worry—there are adjustments you can make to change the sound entirely. \n",
      "\n",
      "The same is true for smartphone cameras, and this year, the iPhone embraces this idea more than ever. The default photos from the iPhone seem more 'iPhoney' than ever. Remember how every year in blind smartphone camera tests, the iPhone tends to lose? It often overly brightens shadows and lacks contrast, especially in photos featuring people. That’s still the case this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this new button is clear: camera control. This year, Apple is kind of giving users more control over the camera in an interesting way. However, you need to know how to use it. For instance, it requires a double half-press with just the right weight to access the menu of camera controls for exposure compensation, zoom, photographic styles, and tone. \n",
      "\n",
      "After experimenting, I realized that tone may be the most critical aspect. Turning up the tone can brighten shadows even more, and turning it down introduces real shadows. However, it doesn’t seem to have memory, so you have to set it every time you open the camera app. You also have a D-pad that allows for changes to even more photo elements, including undertones, mood, and color, giving you more opportunities to refine the desired look of your photos. This setting does have memory, so every subsequent time you open the camera, it will remember your color hue and tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found that setting the tone to around -0.5 provides a nice balance for most of my photos—less flat and more contrasty. This level of control has reinvigorated my love for shooting with the iPhone. The camera control feature is useful. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the button placement on the side of the phone is mostly ideal for landscape photography, though it would be easier to reach if it were closer to the corner. But, let’s be honest, most users take photos in portrait orientation, and positioning it in the corner would be impractical for that. They’ve compromised by moving it up a bit, making it reachable but still not perfect. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the half-press sensitivity requires some adjustment. I’m three weeks in, and I’m still accidentally taking pictures by tapping too hard. Scrolling can be finicky as well; it features momentum physics which can lead you to scroll too far past your target in the continuous scroll interface. This makes it just tricky enough that I genuinely think 99% of people will use it solely as a camera shutter button. \n",
      "\n",
      "For my part, I quickly adapted to opening the camera with the Camera Control button. I’ve remapped my action button to trigger my Tasks app. I’ve also changed my lock screen shortcut to open the flashlight and my Tasks app. It's possible to swipe sideways from the lock screen to access the stock camera app, or you can map the Camera Control button to open any other camera app on your phone and just wait for future Apple Intelligence features that might make more sense for it. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, to sum it up: one, it’s a button. Two, it’s also a customization slider. Three, for most people, it’s just going to be a button. Four, there are new cameras on the back. (bright music)\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro feature new cameras across the line. In short, the iPhone 16’s cameras are solid main cameras. They’re in line with previous iPhone models but not noticeably improved compared to past years. The 16 Pro cameras, with their larger main sensor, higher-resolution ultrawide, and 5X telephoto lens, represent a significant upgrade in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main camera is my favorite primary sensor in any smartphone currently available. It excels at just about everything. The ultrawide camera is also better, particularly in capturing detail during the day, thanks to its new 48-megapixel sensor. However, the sensor isn’t significantly larger, affecting night-time performance. Now my night ultrawide shots often appear a bit vignetted, almost as if I've added a filter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 5X telephoto lens on both Pro models is also impressive. There’s been some buzz about it being less effective in the 3X to 4X range due to it relying on digital zoom, and although that’s technically accurate, I find the 5X zoom to be quite useful. It resolves detail at distances beyond 5X better than before, even without AI enhancements. Shutter speeds are impressively fast, capturing action better than ever—a detail many overlook. I really enjoy that snap of action; for instance, this shot was taken from a moving car at highway speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ability to achieve a shallow depth of field with close-up subjects rivals top-tier Android flagships like the S24 Ultra or Pixel 9 Pro. However, Apple has not resolved the lens flare issue with point lights at night, so sorry to say, that remains unchanged. Video quality is very impressive as well. I’ll be producing the next Auto Focus video on the Silverado EV pickup truck soon, so do subscribe over there. That video will showcase entirely shot content on the iPhone 16 Pro, and I’ve been incredibly pleased with how it turns out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has also added a 4K 120 FPS mode to the Pro phones, which looks fantastic. It’s incredibly convenient for shooting and editing. Just be mindful of your storage space, as it can quickly consume storage—up to nearly a gig per minute before you even consider 4K 120 ProRes or ProRes Log. Regardless, I love shooting in this mode. It proves to me that they have the processing power and sensor readout speed to handle 8K 30 video; they just choose not to, which raises questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is also the first year that Apple is using the term “Fusion camera.” You have to dig a bit to figure out what it means; essentially, it’s similar to last year’s optical-quality zoom but with an updated image processing pipeline. Cool. However, it’s worth noting that this zoom isn’t exactly one-to-one optical quality since the photo sights are smaller in that smaller crop.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the iPhone 16 camera is good. The iPhone 16 Pro camera is great. (upbeat music)\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a bit odd that this product was launched at an Apple event called Glowtime without the feature that glows—the new Siri. It feels strange for people to visit an Apple store on 5th Avenue, which now literally glows with rainbows, and walk out with a new phone that lacks this feature. The marketing seems misaligned, highlighting Apple Intelligence, with Tim Cook even stating that this is the first phone built from the ground up for Apple Intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The next generation of iPhone has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, this phone currently lacks any of the Apple Intelligence features. They’re all promised to come soon via software updates. I’ve reiterated—never buy a product based on the promise of future software updates. Purchase it for what it is right now when you buy it. That’s been a universal rule for ages, but here we are, facing a change in trends. \n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has caved to the pressure to present themselves as an AI-first, AI-leading company, much like various public companies. They’ve showcased a lot of AI features they’re working on and conducted a performance similar to, \"Hey, we are AI-first, the phone is built from the ground up for AI. It's our theme this year.\" However, the reality is, it’s not ready yet—it’s not finished. If it was, they would be shipping it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, it’s in beta, and they seem more inclined to refine it than to release it outright. How do we align this expectation? Do we align it at all? You might recall the Rabbit R1. The Rabbit was a little AI device, quite the standard 2024 product. When I reviewed it, it was nearly useless—almost none of its functionality was operational at launch. \n",
      "\n",
      "I said as much in my review. The same could be said for the Humane AI Pin, which was another poor product missing almost all functionality—easily the worst product I've ever reviewed. Both items have since received updates, but I can only evaluate what’s in front of me, the same as real customers will receive it. This brings the new iPhone into a similar conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the distinction between the Rabbit, the Humane Pin, and the iPhone is that, one, the iPhone is a fine standalone product, functional, while the others are not. Two, Apple has a history of developing and delivering on their promises, unlike Humane and Rabbit. So, there’s an element of trust with Apple that wasn’t present with those other products. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's quite bold of them to launch this product with significant forthcoming features that aren’t available yet. They must have confidence that they will eventually deliver these features, aiming not to upset customers. This reflects the current trend where companies feel pressured to lead in AI, despite many promised features not yet being fully operational.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m planning a separate review focused on Apple Intelligence once those features are rolled out. I’ve been testing some of the features in the iOS 18.1 Beta on my 15 Pro, but even that remains quite limited—mostly writing tools and the new Siri animation. There’s still a long road to travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I encourage you to subscribe to catch my review on Apple Intelligence when it's ready, as it clearly plays a significant role in this phone launch. (bright music)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you've made it this far in the video, or if you’ve skipped ahead to find out whether you should buy these phones—fine; here it is. You should buy the iPhone 16 if you own an iPhone 13 or older, and that phone is on its last legs as you look to upgrade. That's a solid choice. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you have a newer model, upgrading likely won’t feel worth it. The iPhone 16 Pro is recommended if you genuinely want better cameras or displays—that’s where the Pro truly excels compared to the regular model. The entry-level iPhone has never looked better; it features the Camera Control, matches the RAM of the more expensive Pros, sports vibrant colors for those interested, the action button, and shares the same display brightness that can lower to one nit, just like the Pro screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I find I can’t use a 60Hz, $800 phone in 2024. It doesn't work for me, and many others feel the same way, needing the Pro just for that feature. However, plenty of users are indifferent to ProMotion, which is a tough concept for me to grasp. For those individuals, the base phone will serve them perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For someone like me who takes a lot of photos and videos, especially for social media, the upgraded cameras on the Pro models justify the upgrade. But ultimately, I advise purchasing products for what they are today, not what they might be in the future. Even without the promised AI features, the new phones are solid, though very incremental upgrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for watching. I’ll catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (bright music)\n",

      "All right, it's finally here. This is the Apple Vision Pro, marking the beginning of Apple's spatial computing journey. It’s their first headset—whether you call it AR, VR, or a wearable face computer. This is the unboxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything shown in this box represents what you would receive should you decide to spend $3,500, or in this case, $3,900, for the 1TB Vision Pro. You'll see the accessories, and we’ll boot it up for the first time. This is the very start of our Apple Vision Pro investigation and series of videos, so definitely subscribe to be among the first to see when the rest are released.\n",
      "\n",
      "The box is big, but the headset is relatively small. Shout out to JerryRigEverything for the knife. (tape tearing) \n",
      "\n",
      "Inside, we have a really soft box. There’s a smaller box within it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we have three things: the Vision Pro headset, the Vision Pro Zeiss lenses—these optical inserts are for those with prescriptions. They magnetically attach to the headset, so if you wear glasses, you can still use it—and the optional $200 Vision Pro Travel Case. This has a distinct aesthetic; I'll get to that in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s see the headset itself. (gentle music) \n",
      "\n",
      "It's about the size of a Mac box, maybe even larger than the Mac Studio box. It has pull tabs, and I expect good packaging as this is a high-pressure first-gen product for Apple. \n",
      "\n",
      "(gentle music continues)\n",
      "\n",
      "It's like opening a shoebox. Here’s the headset, which comes with a little protective cover and is adorned with one of the bands you've seen in commercials. This is the Solo Knit Band, made of a soft, stretchy fabric. There’s also another band called the Dual Loop Band that likely comes with this headset too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s set that aside for now and see what else is in this shoebox-sized box. \n",
      "\n",
      "This first piece is a \"Designed by Apple in California\" pamphlet. I bet there are stickers in here. Oh, a microfiber cloth! There’s also the Light Seal Cushion. It looks like you get a thin and a thick Light Seal. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the top, there’s a bunch of documentation—more heavy Vision Pro paperwork—and here’s the Dual Loop Band, which goes around the back and over the top of your head for comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the battery that comes with the Vision Pro is heavy and all white. (cover ripping) It has a white braided cable, with a proprietary connector at the end that plugs into the side of the headset. This is a two and a half to three-hour battery with 3,166 milliamp hours. Interestingly, many smartphones with 5,000 milliamp-hour batteries feel lighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "To charge the battery, there’s a USB-C cable and a wall brick. The wall brick is 30 watts—not the fastest, but decent. It includes a C to C braided cable as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s it for the inside of the box. Now, let’s go through these accessories. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the paperwork, as most will encounter this. There’s a booklet outlining what's in the box and a sort of guide on pairing it to your iPhone, how to wear it for the first time, and connecting the straps. It even shows how to store the cable around the battery—make sure to wrap it horizontally with some slack.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bet there are stickers. The polishing cloth is nice and thin, different from the one that comes with the monitors. The front of the headset is glass, so this microfiber will be handy for cleaning it—something I plan to keep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you buy the Apple Vision Pro, you need to undergo a face-scanning process using your iPhone's Face ID sensors to measure depth and scan around your eyes and face. This results in a custom-fitted Light Seal. The Light Seal Cushion can be either thin or thick, depending on your optical needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let’s take off the protective covering from the Vision Pro. It features a standard head size. Upon removing the covering for the first time, you’ll see the glass. It’s reflective in bright light, but it's clear why people will want to carry the Vision Pro cloth, which has \"Vision Pro\" on the microfiber.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you get the headset, you’ll notice two things: first, this is the thicker version of the Light Seal—this thinner version pops off—and second, there’s the custom Light Seal that can be removed, leaving you with the computer itself. It’s compact, akin to other VR headsets, but it has an aluminum housing and numerous sensors. The Light Seal is designed to fit your face and block out light, attaching like the AirPods Max covers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's explore the Dual Loop Band. There’s been much discussion about the Vision Pro's weight, prompting Apple to include two bands. Different sizes are available, so I have both mediums.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two loops—one goes over your head, and one around the back. I’m going to put the Solo Knit Band on for the first time without boots to demonstrate. Adjusting it is straightforward; you can tighten it with a simple crank. The weight predominantly rests on the front and can rest on your cheeks and forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Switching bands is easy. You just pull this orange tab to release the Solo Knit Band from the Vision Pro. The headset has small pods over each ear that house speaker drivers, which are dense and surprisingly heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "To attach the other band, it follows the expected process, using Velcro to adjust the height. After making adjustments, it feels more balanced and comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s take a look at the travel case. This isn’t just a protective layer; it helps keep the glass safe from fingerprints and other issues. It has a handle, and when expanded, it's well-designed; it opens up to reveal molded spaces for the headset and battery. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are designated spots for the cable, power brick, and USB-C charging cable. The case even has an activated carbon deodorizer (do not eat). \n",
      "\n",
      "Using this case makes sense; I’d want protection for the headset during travel. I'm particularly looking forward to using the Vision Pro on airplanes, so I’ll need a spacious backpack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s boot it up for the first time. Here’s the process when you get your Vision Pro: Open the case, get the battery out first, retrieve the headset, choose between the thick or thin Light Seal, and select your band.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battery has a fixed cable that doesn’t appear removable. To connect the headset, you line up a dot on the side with a corresponding mark, twist it, and it will glow, indicating it's booting up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes about a minute, and soon after, you’ll enter the setup process.\n",
      "\n",
      "(gentle startup music)\n",
      "\n",
      "I see a checkbox. How do I look? Ridiculous? Decent? I can see you all. The headset shows a hello prompt, but I’m going to save the complete setup and the use of Vision Pro for the next video.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, let me show you the Zeiss lenses. If you wear glasses or have a prescription, you can use this headset with these lenses. They are quite small, magnetic, and here’s how you attach them. \n",
      "\n",
      "(lenses snapping)\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a strong magnet. Once attached, you scan a code with the headset to inform it of your prescription, adjusting accordingly, which is a well-thought-out feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that wraps it up for now. Stay tuned and subscribe for more videos on setting up and using the Vision Pro. I'll be covering everything from weight distribution to the experiences it offers, including games, movies, and apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, a big shout-out to the sponsor of this video, Anker. If you’re considering the Vision Pro, you probably already have an iPhone, so it’s worth looking into Anker's new MagGo lineup. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their Wireless Charging Station is a compact three-in-one solution that’s lightweight and can charge multiple devices at once. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another great option is the MagGo Power Bank, which attaches via MagSafe to your phone. It features a built-in 10,000 milliamp battery, allowing you to charge your iPhone nearly two full times on the go.\n",

      "Okay, so this is the TCL 40 NXTPAPER, and at first glance, it might not appear to be a particularly special phone. This is a $200 budget Android phone with a 5000 mAh battery, a standard 50-megapixel main camera flanked by a 5-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel macro lens. Inside, you’ll find a MediaTek G88 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and 256 GB of storage. \n",
      "\n",
      "The design is quite basic; it has a squared-off shape with a solid blue color and some sparkles. However, it has one really interesting feature that has caught my attention, and that’s the screen. The TCL 40 NXTPAPER boasts a 6.78-inch, flat, 1080p, 90 Hz display. But when you compare it to another phone, you immediately notice something very different about it: there are no reflections at all—well, almost none. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s called the NXTPAPER because TCL refers to it as a full-color electronic paper display that delivers a reflection-free, full-color, paper-like visual experience. This design looks much better, reduces eye fatigue, and feels more comfortable to hold. My first thought when I saw this was, why doesn’t every phone have this? How is it that a super cheap budget phone is the first one I’ve seen pull this off, and why aren’t more phones doing it? What am I missing?\n",
      "\n",
      "TCL calls it the NXTPAPER because they want you to think of it as similar to an e-paper display. If you’ve ever seen a Kindle or any of the various E Ink displays out there, you know that technology is quite impressive. It minimizes eye fatigue and creates the sensation of something being literally printed on a piece of paper right in front of you. It works beautifully in various lighting conditions because it rearranges actual ink underneath the display.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the NXTPAPER is not exactly that. It’s essentially an LCD display with a textured glass surface and some software tricks to mimic a paper-like display while delivering nearly all the eye comfort benefits that come with e-paper displays. The result is a screen that looks like a normal smartphone display but has zero reflections, which I find highly appealing. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I review phones, I usually spend a lot of time trying to shield these displays from reflections—this is a lesser-known fact. Shooting reflective surfaces can be quite the challenge; I often have to angle the phone and shoot in specific environments, sometimes using a flag to block reflections and make the screen easier to see. With this matte display, I don’t need any of that special treatment. It’s clear at any angle, and the angles that would normally cause a giant reflection simply appear lighter and a little faded but are still readable. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you look straight on, the display is soft and less stressful on the eyes. It kind of has a paper-like quality, reminiscent of those paper-like displays. Most of this is possible thanks to the hardware; there are several extra layers between the actual LCD panel and the user, including this textured glass, which contributes to its anti-reflective characteristics. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are additional benefits as well, such as physically limiting the amount of blue light that passes through. Instead of using a software blue light filter, there’s simply less blue light reaching your eyes due to an additional physical filter. Another understated feature is the feel of the glass; it has a soft-touch effect thanks to its slight texture. You can even see the difference at the cutout for the front-facing camera—textured glass over that area would compromise photo quality, but it’s a clear spot to observe the distinction between the matte finish and glossy glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think all of this makes for a compelling device: the matte finish, nearly zero reflections, reduced eye strain, and the soft-touch surface. There’s even stylus support; TCL produces a stylus that works with this screen. But what’s the catch? Why don’t more phones feature this technology? \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, as you might suspect, there are some downsides. The extra layers on the display have their drawbacks, primarily cutting down the amount of light that gets through, which diminishes both sharpness and overall brightness. The maximum brightness of this screen is 450 nits. It’s sufficient for reading indoors, but outdoors, it can quickly become washed out and disappointingly dim. \n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, while this is a 1080p display, it doesn’t really look like it. If I were to ask you what resolution you think this display is, it might compare closer to 720p. Text is softer, edges appear blurred, and all the corners lack definition. While this makes the display easy on the eyes—nothing feels harsh or overly bright—if you're looking for sharp photos or video details, the layers between your eyes and the display hinder clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The limited brightness also affects contrast, with a rated contrast ratio of just 1500:1, which isn’t great even compared to other budget phones. Additionally, most people use screen protectors, but applying one to a matte display like this wouldn’t make sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a world of feature-rich smartphones with big, bright, clear displays, this technology shifts from being an advantage to a niche feature. Most consumers are not willing to sacrifice the drawbacks of slightly reduced eye strain and reflections for a matte display. Unlike desktop screens, where consumers heavily prioritize display properties, a phone has a variety of aspects that matter to users, and this trade-off doesn’t sit well with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve discussed other niche features in the smartphone market that are excellent but won’t necessarily sell a lot of devices, and this fits perfectly into that category. TCL even includes special NXTPAPER modes in the software. One mode called “color paper” reduces saturation and creates a textured look, making the screen appear like a colored piece of paper with icons in colored ink moving around. There’s even an “ink paper” mode that turns the display black and white.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems silly at first, but if you compare it to an actual E Ink display, this technology shines. An e-reader is the least fatiguing option for your eyes, but they often lack seamless animations, like a realistic page-turn. A smartphone with this specialized hardware layer can come close to that visual level while offering 90 Hz responsiveness, full color, and all the functionality of a phone on top of being an e-reader, which is incredibly innovative. TCL even produces a tablet with this technology and another phone in the same vein.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a cool idea, but almost no one is going to buy it, and that explains why not every phone manufacturer is pursuing this technology for now. \n",

      "All right, so this is a crypto phone. And I know what you’re thinking: \"What the hell is a crypto phone, and why would anyone want that?\" That’s exactly what I thought when this first crossed my radar.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an upper mid-range Android phone with unique material choices from a brand you’ve likely never heard of, featuring specific crypto functions, and it launched at a thousand dollars. Now, I know I have been notably skeptical about crypto, Web3, blockchain, and the Metaverse over the past couple of years, so you may consider me biased. However, I still believe that if you took the crypto out of this phone, it would at least have potential. I’m serious. Let me explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story of this phone actually starts all the way back with the Essential Phone. I don’t know how many of you remember the Essential Phone from 2017, but it was a really interesting and exciting development in the smartphone world. We don’t see many genuinely promising new phone companies emerging, which is what this Andy Rubin startup was promising when they introduced their first phone. It featured a refreshing, minimal design with no protruding camera bumps or big logos. They were one of the first to incorporate a camera notch at the top of the screen with thin bezels and were among the only ones using super premium materials like titanium rails and polished ceramic on the back, along with modular accessory pins on the back — genuinely interesting and cool ideas on top of super clean software.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, this experiment didn’t really catch on. The combination of a high price, mediocre cameras, and a lackluster feature set for everyday consumers, along with launching as a Sprint exclusive, led to extremely low sales. The company eventually disbanded after negative revelations about Andy Rubin, and we never got to see a second iteration, the Essential Phone 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s disappointing to see a promising company with significant talent disappear like that. However, a common occurrence when such businesses dissolve is that the teams involved often find new opportunities. In 2020, a group of engineers from the original Essential team got back together to form a new company called OSOM. They announced their first project, the OSOM OV1, effectively the spiritual successor to the Essential Phone. You can see many similarities in the announcement, including those premium materials — titanium and polished ceramic — and a rectangular design. They also aimed to correct many of the issues that plagued the original Essential Phone, with a noticeably larger size, bigger screen, and bigger battery. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, they didn’t generate enough interest in this new startup phone to bring the whole idea back to life. This is the classic enthusiast phone problem: it's a cool idea that some people really want, but there isn’t enough hype to make it happen. That is until Solana came along. Solana is a Web3 company exploring new projects while OSOM is a hardware team seeking backing to make this phone a reality. Solana brought the funding, and OSOM provided the hardware talent, partnering to turn the OV1 into the rebranded Solana Saga crypto phone, priced at a thousand dollars. \n",
      "\n",
      "So where do we start? There are basically three things that make this a crypto phone rather than just another Android phone: the Solana Mobile Stack, the Seed Vault, and the Dapp store. Outside of those things, the OV1 or the Solana phone is pretty average for an Android device. It has a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip, which is last year’s flagship, with 12 GB of RAM and half a terabyte of storage. However, it's unclear whether it utilizes fast UFS 3.1. It features a nice big 6.67-inch flat 1080p 120 Hz display that gets decently bright, although it’s not LTPO; it simply has a fixed refresh rate. The phone is powered by a 4,100 mAh battery with wireless charging, which is mediocre considering the screen size, but acceptable. It’s also IP68 water and dust resistant, with a microSD card slot for storage expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it has a pair of really mediocre cameras on the back. It carries the same 50-megapixel main camera sensor found in the ROG Phone 7 and the Oppo Find X5 Pro but with inferior software. It’s paired with a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and both can only produce decent images in perfect lighting before falling apart due to a lack of detail and excessive noise. Overall, it's a mixed bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, there are two things about this phone that I’m genuinely impressed by. The first is the materials; the build quality is exceptional. Since it’s basically the same team from the original Essential Phone, they have a knack for using high-quality materials. We’re talking about a matte stainless steel frame with colored titanium buttons and a full ceramic back. While it picks up fingerprints easily, this phone is incredibly durable. It weighs around 250 grams, making it heavier than an iPhone 14 Pro Max. It features nicely squared-off sides, feels solid with no squeaking or creaking, and is ultimately a well-crafted housing for average specs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second thing I appreciate, aside from the crypto features, is the clean software experience. Once you dig into it, it feels very clean, almost like stock Android. It runs Android 13, and while it’s unclear when (or if) it will get Android 14, the system is quick, responsive, and straightforward. You’ll find stock Android quick settings, wallpaper options, and Google apps like clock, calendar, and Chrome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, does any of this justify the thousand-dollar price tag? (exhales) Let’s see: last year’s flagship specs, lackluster cameras, a mediocre battery, and not an impressive screen. While it does have stock Android and good build quality, it doesn’t seem worth a thousand bucks, does it? That's precisely why, less than a year after its release, the price plummeted from a thousand to $600.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the real question is: would anyone pay $600 for a barely above-average, well-built Android phone that just happens to have some crypto features? (sighs) I guess now I need to go over all the crypto and Web3 features. As I mentioned earlier, there are three things that make this a crypto phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Solana Mobile Stack is an SDK for apps to connect to the Solana blockchain. While it’s cool that it’s built in, a downside is that it doesn’t work with any other blockchain. Hence, no Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum support — it’s strictly focused on Solana. The Seed Vault provides dedicated storage for a 24-word seed phrase, kept in a secure environment inaccessible to the Android OS. This lets you unlock your wallet. Lastly, there’s the so-called Dapp store, essentially a second app store on this device specifically for crypto apps. It includes Phantom Wallet, the cryptocurrency exchange OKX, Brave Browser, and more. There’s even an app called Minty Fresh that allows you to convert photos from your camera roll into NFTs quickly, if that’s something you’re interested in.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the only three features that truly distinguish this as a crypto phone. However, one of those features, the Dapp store, isn’t particularly special since it will become available on non-crypto phones as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, I believe you could argue that it’s great to have those specific crypto features built directly into the phone, especially if you’re within the Solana ecosystem, as this is the only place to access those features. However, that’s an incredibly niche offering. Reflecting on the recent Zenfone 10 discussion, which I really enjoy but doubt will sell, it’s a shame how few people prefer small phones. Now consider the likelihood that there are more people interested in the Solana ecosystem who want to buy a dedicated phone versus those desiring a compact phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the most intriguing aspect of this project is this cable that comes in the box with the phone. It’s a braided USB-C cable, but it features a hard switch at the end that blocks all data while allowing only power to pass through, effectively converting it into a charging cable. This is fantastic for preventing \"juice jacking\" attacks, where a public outlet might upload malware to your device or download your data. This cable will prevent that from happening. If you ever find yourself using a rare public USB-C port, this is a fantastic tool to have, but it’s not unique — you can find similar cables on Amazon for around $30, and I’ll link that below.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, I don’t need to tell you that the crypto phone is essentially just a standard Android phone with a couple of interesting but extremely niche crypto features focused on one specific crypto stack — one that is currently struggling, by the way. Moreover, there’s practically no reason for 99.99% of people to buy this phone. Even if you were considering it just for the clean stock Android experience and completely disregarding the crypto features, you could easily find better alternatives for $600. A Pixel 7, likely a Pixel 8 upon release, or a refurbished Galaxy S23 would all be superior options. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, I don’t think this phone should top anyone’s list at that price point. It’s unfortunate because being a new phone company is an incredibly tough challenge unless your name is Carl Pei. I wish there were a world where the OSOM OV1 could thrive and be embraced by a niche community, but instead, it’s become a representation of crypto in 2023 — at best, ahead of its time; at worst, utterly useless for most everyday users and creates an even steeper uphill challenge for whatever follows.\n",

      "So a common phrase in the video world is, \"we'll fix it in post.\" This means that the shot isn't quite perfect, but we can remedy that in post-production, kind of like this. \n",
      "\n",
      "*drums rolling*  \n",
      "*magical music*  \n",
      "There you go. Or how about a little bit of this too? \n",
      "\n",
      "*drums rolling*  \n",
      "*magical music*  \n",
      "There we go, much better. It's not that this approach is lazy; I believe a good filmmaker aims to get as much right in-camera as possible instead of relying on software. The \"we'll fix it in post\" mentality for smartphones is definitely embodied by the Google Pixel. Many of its best features literally involve fixing things in post. For instance, if your face is blurry in a photo, there's Face Unblur. If you didn't quite capture that perfect angle, there's Magic Editor. If there's strange background audio in your video, you can use Audio Eraser to fix it. Many of these strategies, with a little help from AI, actually work, and that's where the Pixel shines. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are aspects of smartphones that you can't really fix in post. First things first, the design on the outside of these phones looks familiar. It resembles previous years of Pixel, which I actually like, but I think this one is better in a few ways. For starters, the camera circles now combine into one big circle, somewhat reminiscent of the iPhone Dynamic Island, which I appreciate with these new, larger sensors. The Pro Pixels also feature a completely flat display, moving away from the slightly curved edges of past models, and they offer a satin back in every color that surprisingly hides fingerprints well, if you're not a case person like I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from that, everything else is where you'd expect it. One thing I'd like to see fixed is the dust that always accumulates right under and above the camera bar. The only way to eliminate that might be to curve the design like they did with the Oppo Find X4 and X3, but I’m not sure if they’ll ever do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most significant improvement in the hardware is definitely in the display. The smaller Pixel 8 now has a 6.2-inch 1080P OLED display, slightly smaller than last year, but it features perfectly thin bezels all around—no more tiny chin like in previous years. It's now upgraded to a 120Hz display that reaches a maximum brightness of 2,000 nits, which is incredible. They've dubbed it the Actua display, and it remains visible at all times. Auto brightness has also been reliable this time, though it’s not LTPO, so you might want to disable the always-on feature to save battery life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pixel 8 Pro boasts a new 6.7-inch LTPO display, closer to 1440P, with a maximum brightness of 2,400 nits. This display is among the brightest I've ever seen on a smartphone, and I certainly did not expect that from a Pixel. They call it the Super Actua display. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the hardware feels as premium as any flagship from Xiaomi, Samsung, or others. The build quality, metal rails, satin back, clicky buttons, and bright displays all contribute to a rare win for Pixel hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two more small details about the display: first, there's still just a single front-facing camera at the top, but Google has found a way through software to extract more info from this camera to support secure unlock for things like banking apps and logging in. Instead of adding extra hardware like an infrared camera, they've achieved this through software magic, which is convenient. Secondly, the fingerprint reader hasn’t improved. While most high-end flagships feature super-fast ultrasonic fingerprint scanners, this one is still optical and a bit slower. It’s not terrible, but you can tell it isn’t as fast or consistent in wet conditions compared to something like a Samsung phone. It also hasn't increased in size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, speaking of the Pixel, we should delve into its camera, as this is where the \"fix it in post\" mentality is pushed to its maximum. The new camera sensors across the board perform admirably, featuring a 50-megapixel primary sensor shared between the 8 and the 8 Pro with F1.7 OIS. Pixel photos look sharp, with impressive dynamic range, and autofocus is quick and effective in achieving shallow depth of field with close-up subjects. However, much of what defines a Pixel photo or video is its software. \n",
      "\n",
      "The multiple exposures blend into one HDR shot, and there's strategic relighting for recognized faces. There seems to be extra noise reduction this year, resulting in some images appearing somewhat \"watercolor-like,\" but the resolution is high enough that it generally doesn’t look terrible at lower zoom levels. I’ve also noticed a tendency to overdo HDR in some instances. \n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to features, there’s a lot to unpack. You likely already know about Magic Eraser, which removes unwanted subjects from images with ease. Then there's Face Unblur for photos where someone was moving too fast or where shaky hands resulted in a blurry face. Finally, there's \"The Best Take,\" perfect for those who take group photos. This feature allows you to select the best expression from a series of burst shots, ensuring no one in the picture has their eyes closed or is looking the wrong way. This is a huge time-saver for holiday cards and similar occasions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In video, I've noticed improvements over the last year; it's less noisy in the shadows with nice depth of field and quick autofocus. I recorded almost an entire video with the Pixel 8 Pro, and it looks good. However, some footage has a noticeable artificial brightening effect on my face. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Audio Eraser video feature is decent, allowing for some background sound removal, although it can't save a video from disruptive environments completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, about the Pixel's software capabilities: the integration of features like Magic Editor is remarkable. Simply open a photo, hit Edit, and use the colorful Magic Editor button to remove or move objects, resize them, or even change the time of day. While these edits aren't perfect, they are convincing enough for regular users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding battery life, you can't fix that in post. A bright 2,400 nit screen demands substantial energy, so hardware and an efficient chip are crucial. I'm glad to report good battery life on the Pixels, especially the 8 Pro, regularly achieving six to eight hours of screen-on time.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the real question is how long this battery life will last—whether it will remain strong for months or potentially falter like prior models. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the Pixel continues to excel at its core strengths. From call screening to an enhanced Google Assistant experience, the software feels intuitive. Android 14 has already revitalized older Pixels, although the only significant issue I've faced is a delay when opening Twitter notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "One new feature worth mentioning is the ability to ask Google Assistant for a summary of webpages in Chrome. However, it appears many applications don’t yet support this feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the Pixel 8 feels like a strong contender among flagship devices. It boasts excellent hardware, software features, and seven years of updates, starting at a price of $700. Given its capabilities, I consider this phone worth the price tag.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for whether the $300 premium for the Pro model is justified, it's a tough call. The differences come down to a few extra features. The Pixel 8 is an excellent phone, while the Pro model serves those who specifically desire the upgraded camera and additional functionalities. \n",

      "All right, so Apple's Wonderlust event happened, and it was pretty interesting. Honestly, not that much new stuff got announced. We knew it would mostly be about the iPhone, Apple Watch, and USB-C—nothing too surprising. However, it was the subtler details in between that I found interesting, along with a few random points that I don't think a lot of people are talking about. So let's dive in.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, I have to say it was a complete surprise when they quoted my MacBook Air review during the keynote. You know how, at the beginning of these events, they recap previous highlights? One of the things they featured was the MacBook Air, and they showcased my quote: “The 15-inch MacBook Air is going to instantly rocket to the top of the lineup to become the most popular 15-inch laptop.” They expressed excitement for the new MacBook Air and the entire Mac lineup. That was pretty cool. They didn’t give me a heads-up about it, didn’t ask for permission, and didn’t pay for it; they just went ahead and did it. So, shout-out to Tim Cook for that. It’s a moment of pride knowing how far we've come since the early days—back when there were zero YouTubers at these events, and now we’re recognized as part of the media landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, they jumped right into the announcements, with the main highlight being the new iPhone. I created a separate video focusing on the iPhones, detailing my first hands-on impressions and various features, so I'll link that below the Like button if you're interested. Here’s a brief summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "The iPhone 15 features the A16 Bionic chip from last year's iPhone Pro, the Dynamic Island from the Pro lineup, some new colors, and a slightly updated design with better curves and a softer touch on the back. It also includes a USB-C port, with the same starting price and screen sizes as last year: $799 for the iPhone 15 and $899 for the iPhone 15 Plus. \n",
      "\n",
      "The iPhone 15 Pro, on the other hand, gets the new three-nanometer A17 Pro chip, lighter brushed titanium rails replacing stainless steel, a faster USB-C port, a customizable action button on the side replacing the mute switch, new cameras, and the 15 Pro Max features a new 5x telephoto camera. The prices are somewhat deceptive; it's still $999 for the 15 Pro, but the Pro Max now starts at $1,199, as it also begins with 256GB of storage. There are plenty more details in that hands-on video if you're curious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto the other highlights from the event. I thought it would be fun to shoot here because part of it is where they filmed some scenes for the keynote, but I’m realizing it’s actually a noisy place with chainsaws in the background, so I apologize for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the Apple Watch announcements: Series 9 and Ultra 2. One intriguing aspect of these new watches is that, visually, there's almost no way to tell them apart from their predecessors. The Series 9 introduces a new pink color, but aside from that, it looks identical to the Series 8. The Ultra 2 looks the same as the original Ultra. However, under the hood, there’s a significant upgrade with the new S9 system on a chip, which is both more powerful and efficient. This allows for a higher maximum brightness while maintaining the same battery life. The Series 9 can now reach up to 2,000 nits, and the Ultra 2 goes up to 3,000 nits, making it the brightest display ever on any Apple product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Siri requests on the watch now process on-device, eliminating the need for a round trip to the internet, which should improve response times. While this doesn’t necessarily mean Siri will become great, it should be faster. Another feature is the new Ultra Wideband chip that can communicate with iPhones to make the “Find My iPhone” feature much more precise and direct rather than just playing a sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most interesting update, though, is the new double-tap gesture. With the new watch, it can detect a double-tap of your thumb and index finger. At the event, I tried this several times with a demo watch, and it seemed quite accurate. You raise the watch to wake it, give it a moment, and then double-tap to interact with the primary button of whatever app you're using. This allows you to accept or reject phone calls, stop timers, or scroll through widgets quickly without needing to use your other hand. Honestly, I’d usually try to do this with my nose, so it’s a welcome improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "What makes this update sneaky is that it’s not entirely new; if you’ve explored the accessibility settings on the Apple Watch, you might have come across a similar feature under a different name. Apple claims that the new S9 chip is faster in processing information from sensors, which is why this feature will only be available on the new S9-powered watches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's quickly touch on AirPods, as they received a sneaky update as well. During the keynote, the AirPods Pro 2 saw a brief mention of a new USB-C case, leading many to think there weren’t any substantial updates. However, this isn’t entirely accurate. The AirPods Pro 2 with the Lightning case and those with the USB-C case are essentially the same product with different ports, unless you have the Apple Vision Pro. In that case, the USB-C version supports lossless audio with low latency through a new codec developed specifically for it, enhancing the immersive experience. If you don’t have the Vision Pro, then yes, they’re pretty much the same product aside from the type of charging case. Apple hasn't emphasized this differentiation to avoid making recent buyers feel left out, but there are indeed distinctions in the hardware for the new USB-C version.\n",
      "\n",
      "This leads to the last major theme of the event: carbon neutrality and environmental initiatives. Apple was very vocal about their environmental efforts during the keynote, including a lengthy skit with Tim Cook and Apple employees discussing their progress. I’ll delve deeper into this in a future video since I’m not an expert and can’t entirely grasp everything that was presented. However, some points were clear, like their commitment to eliminate leather from all products, using recycled materials, and sourcing more sustainable energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple ultimately announced that the Apple Watch is the first fully carbon-neutral product they’re shipping, aiming for full carbon neutrality as a company by 2030. While it’s true they have a long way to go, I can't really criticize the improvements being made. It’s reminiscent of those YouTube videos where someone gives money to someone in need while being recorded; it's hard to argue that some good isn’t done even if the motive isn't entirely pure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m definitely interested in learning more and discussing this with environmental experts in the future. Those are my thoughts and reactions from the 2023 Wonderlust event. Let me know what you think in the comments below; there’s a lot to unpack. Techtember continues, so stick around. Subscribe if you haven’t already. Thanks for watching, and catch you later.

It has a rather unimpressive battery life and drains quickly, dying within four hours, leading to the need for multiple charges a day. It was a pain to charge; it took 45 minutes to go from zero to a hundred percent.\n",

      "Moreover, it lacks several basic features. For example, it can't set alarms or timers, record videos or photos, or send emails, and there’s no integrated calendar. There are just many functions you would typically expect from an assistant that aren't present. And being an AI assistant, it still hallucinates and often gives incorrect answers to questions. I frequently find myself asking questions I already know the answers to, just to get wrong responses—one of the downfalls of this technology.\n",

The Humane Pin received widespread criticism for its $700 price combined with a $24 a month subscription to avoid turning into a brick—which is quite outrageous. The Rabbit R1, however, costs $200 with no subscription fee. This is a more manageable investment, but it's important to note that you’ll need a separate SIM card for cellular functionality. While there’s no subscription fee, you will still incur a monthly charge for data outside of Wi-Fi.\n",

The camera is basic, the speaker feels cheap, and it’s powered by a low-end MediaTek chip found in more affordable phones.

      "Just like the Humane AI Pin, this device has no apps. The other feature they're hoping will distinguish it is what they call a \"large action model.\" Large language models process natural language, allowing AIs to respond to us in conversational ways. A large action model, theoretically, is meant to take our commands and translate them into actions, allowing it to use apps as a human would.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than relying on APIs—where a company might work with others to connect services—this model aims to replicate human interaction with apps using a mouse and keyboard, essentially acting as a virtual agent.

      "I want to avoid turning this into a rant, but we need to recognize that many tech companies are developing products in a rather backward way. They launch unfinished products that make it difficult to provide a proper review. It used to be that you developed a product and then sold it; now it seems they sell half-baked devices and promise to iterate and improve over time—a process that often leads to messy user experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "This trend spans numerous product categories. We’ve seen it in gaming, where studios release buggy “alpha versions” of full-price titles, and in automotive, where vehicles are delivered without promised features that will arrive through future software updates. Smartphones have followed suit for years, launching models with significant features promised for later. Now, with AI products at the forefront of this issue, we face nearly non-functional devices compared to their promised capabilities—but we still pay full price. This reality poses challenges not just for buyers, but also for reviewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you evaluate a product where the potential future version may seem incredible, while the current version is subpar? Should reviewers give the benefit of the doubt? I'm unsure—we need to tread carefully.\n",

      "I’m genuinely excited about the idea of a highly personalized AI assistant capable of performing tasks like a human assistant. Different companies exploring varied approaches to achieve that goal is encouraging. But achieving this vision will require considerable time, effort, technical development, and vast amounts of data. An effective assistant must know your preferences, location, activities, and much more—essentially, a wealth of personalized information.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of Rabbit, focusing on a lower price point is a strategic move. Investing in the Humane Pin requires a significant financial commitment for uncertain future potential, while a $200 investment for the Rabbit feels far less daunting. If it evolves into something remarkable, it will be easier to justify the initial investment, especially if those 800 apps end up being truly useful. \n",
      "\n",
      "The situation reminds me of the early days of Tesla when they released cars with beta autopilot features. Tesla leveraged user data to refine its systems, enhancing its autopilot capabilities through real-world experience. Rabbit hopes to replicate that by getting devices into users’ hands to start beta testing and improving.\n",

      "However, the Rabbit faces a challenge: while it offers a lower price, it lacks a strong enough initial attraction to entice users. It creates a kind of chicken-and-egg dilemma.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my advice is what you've likely heard before: buy a product based on its current capabilities rather than its promised future potential. This principle is especially challenging in this category because the allure of possibilities is immense, but it’s essential to remember.\n",

      "All right, imagine this: you're starting a new smartphone company with the goal of making it huge. You launch your first phone with a bang, attracting a lot of enthusiasts, and slowly start to grow. Your phone is doing well in Europe, India, and a few other Asian markets. Things seem to be going quite nicely, but you notice there's not much traction in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few reasons for this. Many people in the U.S. prefer to walk into a carrier store to buy their phones. If you don't have a deal with a carrier, breaking into the market might be challenging. You’re primarily selling online, which doesn’t help with mainstream adoption. The statistics are eye-opening too. The iPhone holds around 50% of the U.S. market share, higher than the global average, and it’s steadily growing each year. Even more shocking, 87% of teenagers in the U.S. have an iPhone. This statistic is telling because it indicates that many of these individuals got their first phones early on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once you're in Apple's ecosystem, it’s tough to break free. Everyone knows about the barriers Apple builds around their ecosystem to keep users within the iPhone walled garden. For many teenagers, their friends all have iPhones, and if they are getting their first phone, they may not even consider anything that isn't an iPhone. It’s the only way to participate in group chats and social interactions that occur through FaceTime and iMessage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my video titled \"Blue Bubbles vs. Green Bubbles: Explained,\" I mentioned this phenomenon. Almost half the comments were from people in the U.S. agreeing with my observations about the overwhelming presence of iPhones and their peer pressure. The other half dismissed it, suggesting that people should just use WhatsApp since it's easy to use. This dichotomy reflects the strong divide in smartphone preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, as this hypothetical smartphone company, you're trying to break into the U.S. market. What do you do? This is a genuine question and, as hinted by the title of this video, we’re discussing a real company: Nothing. They’ve launched their first two phones and are trying to gain a foothold, but their options are limited – either give up on the U.S. altogether, attempt a carrier deal, or lean into the issue at hand. \n",
      "\n",
      "What Nothing has decided to do, announced today, is to integrate iMessage into their Android phone—sort of. They are launching an app exclusive to the Nothing Phone 2, called the Nothing Chats app, which aims to offer iMessage features on their device.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, how does this work? Great question! The app is co-developed with a company called Sunbird, which has been testing similar features in a restricted beta. You can sign in using an Apple ID, even without any Apple products. Once signed in, you’ll find that most iMessage features work effectively without needing an iPhone. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Nothing Chats app is pretty intuitive upon signing in. You create a Nothing account and then connect to your Apple ID. The interface looks similar to the Sunbird beta app. When you send a message to an iPhone or join a group chat with iPhone users, it starts by sending a virtual contact card to merge your contact info with your Apple ID email. Suddenly, it all works, and you're sending iMessages as a blue bubble from your Android phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, high-quality media sharing is functioning as well. Typically, when sending photos or videos between Android and iPhone, the quality suffers due to compression for MMS limits. But now, you're able to send full-resolution media, which is a significant improvement. Typing indicators also work, and while reactions aren’t available yet in the beta, they should be included by the end of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "This app is currently exclusive to the Nothing Phone 2, aiming to provide an alternative for users who want the iMessage experience without buying an iPhone. However, there's a critical concern: significant security issues arise from signing in with your Apple ID on a device you don’t own. Using this method poses a potential risk to users. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you sign in, you're effectively logging in on a remote Mac Mini somewhere that facilitates all the messaging. Although the company claims everything is encrypted and secure, signing in with your Apple ID on someone else's device introduces inherent risks. Many users may be wary of adopting this solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Nothing, this strategy could attract attention and offer a compelling reason for potential customers in the U.S. to consider their phones instead of defaulting to iPhones. I even asked Carl Pei from Nothing what he thinks Apple might do in response once they learn about this development. He suggested they might not do much, given the current antitrust pressures they face. \n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has been using iMessage to retain users, and publicly acknowledging this new competitor could draw unwanted attention. They might quietly ignore it, perhaps warning about security risks but without taking strong action. The discussion about whether Apple supports RCS to improve communication security between Android and iPhone is another topic altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the real question remains: will this strategy work? Will offering iMessage features on Nothing's phone help them penetrate the U.S. market? There are definitely users out there who might consider this option, draining the pressure of needing an iPhone to stay connected with friends. \n",

      "So, it's a bit of a tradition around here to unbox the newest iPhones on the day they come out. We're upholding this tradition this year to find one single difference compared to last year's unboxings. We’ve got four iPhones here in new colors: the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, where the boxes show the back of the phones, and the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, which display the front. I'm definitely going to start with the base phones, the crowd favorites this year. Finally, there are some colors back in the iPhone lineup.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m going to call this one the flagship color: the Ultra Marine iPhone 16. In the box, you get a USB-C cable, again braided and high quality, and a tiny bit of paperwork, shaped like a pill. You'll notice that there’s no SIM card tool, just like last year, and no stickers this year either. There are absolutely no stickers included in the iPhone 16 box. Truly the end of an era. They just can't stop removing things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s take a look at the pink Plus-sized phone, too. These phones are the same sizes as last year: 6.1 inches for the base and 6.7 inches for the Plus. However, they have bigger batteries inside, which I'm really happy to hear about and very curious to test. I'm just glad we finally have colors back. The back of the phone is slightly more pale, but the glass around the camera is darker, and the rails of the phone are also darker, which looks nice. The same contents are in the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with the Pro phones, there’s a reason they show the front of the phone on the box: if they displayed the back, you literally could not tell the difference from last year. At least this model has slightly thinner bezels they can showcase. This year, we have the Natural Titanium iPhone 16 Pro. Aside from the lack of stickers in the box, it looks and feels basically the same as the titanium iPhone 15 Pro. It comes with the same USB-C cable as the base phone, too. Great!\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the new flagship Pro color, the renders we saw at first were a bit strange, but this is the official Desert Titanium color. All of Apple's phones are a bit more pale on the back this year, but have more color on the sides, which is definitely true here. The color is reminiscent of light sand but also has similarities to past gold hues.\n",
      "\n",
      "That wraps up the iPhone 16 unboxing experience. By the time you see this uploaded, it means I’m deep into my iPhone 16 testing and working on the full review. So, definitely subscribe to catch that when it drops. If there are any specific things you want to see discussed or that haven’t been covered enough in the review, let me know in the comment section below. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I can share some quick observations from my first few days and my first week of testing. First of all, there is a size difference compared to last year. The base phones are the same sizes, as noted: 6.1 and 6.7 inches in the same body sizes. However, the Pro phones are both bigger. The iPhone 16 Pro goes from 6.1 to 6.3 inches. Even with the thinner bezels, the phone is slightly taller and wider. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has grown from 6.7 inches to 6.9 inches diagonally, making it an absolutely gigantic phone. It's already huge, but now it’s even taller and wider—biggest phone they’ve ever made. If you look at it next to the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is also a massive phone for context, you'll see how large it is, and that phone even comes with a stylus.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's clear that Apple has put more battery capacity in this phone, which is great. I'm glad they're not going the route of making it thinner or shrinking battery size. However, if you opt for the new Pro Max this year, you're getting a genuinely huge phone—borderline tablet-sized.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a random note, thanks to the new cameras positioned in the corners, these new iPhones are major table rockers. The uneven camera on the back is a bit annoying, especially when typing on a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been taking some pictures and videos with the new cameras and will be posting many more soon. If you want to follow my journey on Instagram, where I’ll share more in the coming days, I’ll link that below. My first impression is that it’s quite remarkable how consistent Apple’s image processing pipeline is every year. Unlike many companies that switch sensors, leading to a change in the overall look, Apple's phones maintain the same recognizable iPhone look year after year, regardless of hardware or sensor updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've also run some benchmarks and gathered the new Geekbench 6 scores for the new A18/A18 Pro in these phones. I’m not noticing a massive difference in performance with these new phones. The true impact will be felt more in high-demand scenarios and as the phones age. However, Geekbench revealed that all of these models now have eight gigabytes of RAM. Previously, the Pro phones had different amounts of RAM compared to the regular models, but that’s no longer the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple emphasized in the keynote that these are the first phones built from the ground up for Apple Intelligence. Is that what this indicates? Clearly, a lot of memory is needed to run these AI models, and all the phones have a more powerful neural engine compared to last year. However, these devices all launch with iOS 18.0, which has zero Apple Intelligence features available on launch. But that’s a discussion for another day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most significant new physical change in these devices is the added button here. Apple refused to refer to it as a button during the keynote and even doubled down in several executive interviews that day. It's quite odd.\n",
      "\n",
      "- To just put out the biggest burning question right front and center in the discourse: it is a real button, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "- Ah! (group laughing)\n",
      "\n",
      "- It’s a physical thing that depresses, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "- I think it’s a first of its kind. There is a tactile switch that gives you that final click.\n",
      "\n",
      "- So, just to clarify, it is an actual moving, clicking physical button called Camera Control. (laughs) But it's more than just a button. It’s made its way onto all these phones, not just the Pros.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s dive into that. The Camera Control button, as the name suggests, only controls camera-related functions. It’s not like another Action button; it's a Camera Control button. Press it once to open the camera, press it again to take a photo, and hold it down to start recording a quick video. It also has a large capacitive touch-sensitive surface with a vibration motor underneath. While it doesn't half-press, the vibration motor simulates the feeling of a half-press, akin to a real camera. You can double-tap to switch through various camera controls like zoom, photographic styles, or tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes some getting accustomed to since the swipes have momentum physics, meaning you can swipe too fast or too far and overshoot what you intended. It can feel a bit finicky, especially as you can perform all these actions using the on-screen buttons. That being said, when using Camera Control, all of the other buttons fade away, encouraging you to utilize the Camera Control for your needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The placement of the button seems designed with landscape mode in mind, but ideally, it would have been better positioned at the corner. Given how many people capture photos and videos vertically, they placed it further up, splitting the difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, third-party apps will be able to integrate with it if they use the camera. It’s already working with Kino, and it's expected to work with Snapchat soon, along with other camera-related apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also curious about how cases would accommodate this new button. It turns out there are basically two options. The first option is a simple cutout on the side of the case, exposing it to the finger. This would likely be the route most inexpensive cases take, but it means the button won’t be flush with the case. The second option, which Apple’s first-party cases employ, is a little insert made of glass that transfers the capacitance from the button outside the case to the Camera Control button on the phone itself, maintaining a flush feel. It appears to work quite well—the half press still functions smoothly, the swiping works properly, and the vibration motor transfers through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, Beats by Dre cases now include this feature. Yes, I’ll say it again: there are Beats by Dre iPhone cases now! It’s surprising since I thought Beats primarily focused on audio products, but perhaps they’re expanding into the realm of iPhone accessories.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish, and I know I’m not alone in this, that this button also functioned as Touch ID, but then they wouldn’t be able to call it Camera Control, I guess. I wonder if there’s a possibility of that in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of third-party accessories, that’s where dbrand comes in as our video sponsor. For this sponsor segment, we’re doing something a bit different. Screen protectors aren’t my favorite thing. They can be a hassle to install, with alignment and dust being common issues. This is why I don’t use them all the time. \n",

      "\n",
      "This brings us to the Quest 3, the latest and greatest headset from Meta. My theory is that on one side of the scale, we have VR headsets, and on the other side, we have smart glasses. Meta has also announced smart glasses at their event, known as the RayBan Meta Smart Glasses, or RayBan Stories 2. As of now, they are quite simple; they only incorporate a camera, small speakers, and a battery. However, there are some clever tricks that allow them to maximize their functionality. Perhaps one day the technology will become powerful and useful enough for people to want to use these every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "VR headsets are racing to get smaller, while smart glasses are striving to improve their technology. Both are essentially racing toward each other, and companies like Meta are investing significant amounts of money to determine which strategy will succeed first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the headset. The Quest 3 has made a significant pivot to being a mixed reality headset, which seems like a natural progression for making these devices more comfortable for everyday wear like glasses. In previous VR headsets, pass-through functionality felt like an afterthought; you'd put the headset on and immediately be immersed in your own world until taking it off. The new version, while still immersive with light-blocking displays, features more sensors around the outside, vastly improving pass-through capabilities. It's now color, stereo, very low latency, and decently high resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having such a high-quality pass-through comes with numerous benefits. First, the setup is far more intuitive. You can take it to a new space, put it on, and it will automatically map out the floor of the room. It accurately identifies available space and objects around you using RGB cameras and a Lidar sensor. You no longer need to painstakingly draw a play area each time you use it; it feels as though the menu is floating right where you are standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might wonder how good the Quest 3 actually is compared to others, such as the Quest Pro. Yes, it is better than the Quest Pro but not as good as the Apple Vision Pro. I would liken it to wearing a clear pair of glasses that aren’t exactly your prescription. The Quest 3 features stereo and color capabilities, near real-time response, and accurate color representation, allowing you to see your hands and locate controllers without help. While there can be some distortion with close objects and at the edges of your vision, it's still of high enough fidelity for enjoyable use. You'll still need to take the headset off to read texts or use your phone screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing it to a $3,500 headset seems unnecessary, but many people ask me about it, and I happen to have experience with both. The Apple Vision Pro still offers the best pass-through I've experienced, as I could take notes on my phone while wearing it—which was quite impressive. However, for a $500 headset, the Quest 3 is the best you can get right now and has high-resolution menus with accurate controller tracking, which is fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another major advantage of the high-quality sensors on the headset is that you might not even need controllers at all. You have the option to use either the controllers or your hands. The controllers have improved over the years, becoming smaller and more responsive with better haptics. Hand tracking has also gotten significantly better, contributing to a more intuitive, futuristic feel. You can perform pinch gestures to pull up menus and select items, scroll through menus by touching and flipping them in space, or move windows around with ease. Typing, however, is still a challenge without haptic feedback, as you'll be poking at an invisible space where the virtual keyboard exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these limitations, the primary selling point of this headset remains gaming. It supports all the same games as the Quest 2, with additional titles optimized for the Quest 3. With the next-gen Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip, higher resolution per eye, and a more immersive field of view, it's slightly more comfortable thanks to a new strap that enhances weight distribution. Personally, I’ve enjoyed playing a golf game that felt surprisingly realistic, as well as ping pong, which features a multiplayer mode where another player’s avatar stands in your space. Of course, you still have classics like Beat Saber and Super Hot, along with new titles emerging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's talk about the smart glasses. These are the Meta Smart Glasses, which are limited by the amount of technology that can fit into a regular-looking pair of glasses that nobody pays much attention to. However, as technology continues to improve and miniaturize, these glasses will become increasingly capable over time. Right now, they come with a 12-megapixel camera and an LED light ring indicating when they are recording or taking pictures.\n",
      "\n",
      "They include a shutter button, a computer with storage, a touchpad, microphones, and tiny speakers that direct sound into your ears. While they may not seem like much at first, when paired with your phone and the Meta View app, they become quite powerful as a wearable computing device. You can use the camera for first-person pictures and videos limited to 60 seconds, and despite these constraints, they produce solid content. You can also start a recording or take a picture using voice commands, though you might prefer to use the shutter for convenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although they can send and receive audio messages through Meta platforms like WhatsApp, they lack a screen, making them most suitable for audio-based activities. They're always connected to your phone via Bluetooth, allowing you to listen to music. The directional speakers minimize sound leakage at lower volumes, and while they can get pretty loud, it's more akin to someone listening nearby with open-back headphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can interact with the Meta virtual assistant to ask questions, and it will respond audibly in your ears. Though it has limitations—such as not being able to set alarms or integrate with non-Meta services—the glasses' design allows for discreet phone calls in public, which is a significant selling point. They come in two styles, the Headliner and the Wayfarer. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the biggest downside is battery life. With limited capacity, the glasses will typically last under two hours with heavy use. Meta claims a total of 36 hours of battery life with the charging case, which works similarly to earbuds.\n",
      "\n",
      "This tech really represents the pinnacle of what's possible in a normal-looking pair of glasses today, but as technology advances, we can expect to see more features packed into these small frames. The central question remains: Which of these technologies will achieve mass adoption first? Tech companies need to decide where to invest. Meta has a stake in both, so they may win either way. Snapchat’s primarily focused on smart glasses, while Apple has begun with the Vision Pro and is already working on miniaturizing that tech.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a fascinating time to witness all of this! The technology we’ll be using on our faces in 10 to 20 years will look truly remarkable compared to what we have now, just as the technology from a decade ago seems outdated now.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, here's what I think: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Quest 3, priced at $500, is an excellent option if you're looking for a VR or mixed reality headset.\n",
      "2. Apple’s Vision Pro is set to launch in early 2024, and I expect it to be impressive, so stay tuned for that review.\n",
      "3. We're undoubtedly moving toward a future where wearable computers will be commonplace on our faces. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you doubt that we'll all wear these devices for a long time, it’s likely that we’ll get something smaller and more unobtrusive as time goes on. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, which side do you pick? Thanks for watching. Catch you on the next one. Peace.\n",

      "Okay, so there were serious rumors that the 10th generation Apple Watch was going to undergo a significant redesign. Remember the iPhone 10? It reset the design language of the whole iPhone line. Plus, \"10\" is such a nice, round number, right? So, we kind of assumed that maybe the Apple Watch would do the same thing. In my last few years reviewing the Apple Watch—Series 8 and Series 9—I mentioned, \"Look, these are good watches, but they clearly have very incremental improvements. If you want a big upgrade, maybe wait for the 10th generation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here we are. I've been using the Apple Watch Series 10 for the past week, and... well, it's definitely another incremental upgrade. Now, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Sure, it’s not as exciting as a total redesign, but it does make this review pretty straightforward regarding whether you should get one or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main physical differences this time are that it's slightly thinner, lighter, and bigger. The numbers say it’s 10% thinner and 10% lighter for the aluminum version. They’ve also dropped stainless steel in favor of titanium on the higher-end models, making those 20% lighter. The screens for both sizes are even bigger now, allowing for more visibility and comfort on the wrist. In fact, it feels like someone took last year's Apple Watch and just squashed it down a little bit—that’s the new design. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's more complicated than that. There is a new one-piece metal back and a re-engineered speaker that's 30% smaller, which allows for this new shape. Still, the end result is very much an incremental update rather than a dramatic new form factor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, this new design visually reminds me more of a Pixel Watch, depending on the watch face you choose, mainly due to how the top edges are more curved and how everything melds into the sides, especially with the new Jet Black color. The larger 46mm Apple Watch Series 10 basically has the same screen size as the Apple Watch Ultra. Apple loves to showcase this by displaying an older watch next to the newer watch, bragging about the bigger screen for more text and content—making it easier to use the onscreen keyboard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I never felt that made much difference, except maybe with the Ultra. But this year, I noticed something specific: The Disc Sports Workout now shows an extra line of information. Instead of showing time, active calories, total calories, and heart rate, it now includes miles as well. So, there's that. \n",
      "\n",
      "watchOS 11 launches with these new watches and gets pushed as a software update to older Apple Watches too. Features like the new Vitals app—which gives you an energy score similar to the Garmin Body Battery—are included. There’s also sleep apnea detection, which just received FDA approval to detect and notify you of potentially high levels of sleep apnea using only the accelerometer. Additionally, there's training load, which tracks the perceived intensity of workouts. These features are nice and will also be available on some older models. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you want to know what features are exclusive to the newest watch—something to justify getting it—here are four key points. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. The redesigned speaker now allows you to listen to media out loud on the watch. Previously, you could take calls and set alarms, but now you can play music, podcasts, or audiobooks out loud. You could be out hiking, forget your headphones, and just... well, don’t be that guy. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. The updated LTPO 3 display can now drop all the way down to 1 Hertz instead of 10 Hertz. This means you can see the second hand all the time when the Always On Display is on without draining battery. Plus, it shows slightly better off-axis viewing angles, allowing for discreet checking of the time without looking like you're checking your watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. There’s a new water temperature sensor. Admittedly, I don't spend much time around deep water, so I can’t provide test results for this sensor, but it’s there!\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Faster charging is another welcome update. If you use the Puck that comes with it, you can get it up to around 65% from dead in about half an hour. It’s supposed to charge to 80%, but that didn’t quite happen in our tests. \n",
      "\n",
      "And that's it—those are the major updates for the 10th generation. There’s also the new S10 SiP inside. While it features an improved neural engine, it doesn’t seem to be noticeably faster or better than the S9.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, is that enough? The more I think about it, Apple has called this a redesign, and during the keynote, they emphasized how significant this 10th generation is. Now that they've branded it as such, I'm fairly confident we'll see this design for the next 5 to 10 years. This appears to be the Apple Watch's new look moving forward, with even smaller changes expected in the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "The two aspects of this update that made a big difference for me are the larger display and faster charging. The larger display is obvious, and faster charging is great, especially if you want to drop it on the charger and quickly get a good amount of use. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I'm not using this for sleep tracking because I've been using Eight Sleep for my metrics, so shoutout to them! The Eight Sleep Pod 4 Ultra can adjust temperatures on each side of the bed independently and provides biometric tracking with 99% accuracy, which I think gives it an advantage over something worn on your wrist. You can check your sleep stages in the app, and it’s been helping me adjust back to my sleep routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have an older Apple Watch—like Series 4, 5, 6, or 7—and want a new one, then yes, this is the upgrade you should get. That’s the easiest conclusion you could draw for this product. However, as a reviewer, I feel I should predict the future of this product based on Apple’s presentation language. I genuinely don’t think we’ll see any planned significant upgrades for a while, which is unfortunate. All those major features we had hoped for—a rotating bezel, a circular design, or meaningful battery improvements—were absent from this 10th generation redesign. This feels like Apple’s definitive statement, saying, “This is the Apple Watch.” \n",
      "\n",
      "So, that’s it for the review. Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace. \n",

      "All right, we just need to talk about something real quick. One of the biggest announcements at Google's fall event was that they plan to support the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro with seven years of OS security and feature drop updates. This is industry-leading and truly impressive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a list of some other promises made in the smartphone world regarding how long they plan to support their devices. In the realm of Android, this level of commitment is unprecedented. Clearly, this was one of the best announcements of the Google event, and it's great to finally see this kind of support. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, Google has a history of discontinuing products and abandoning projects and services that many people use or depend on. So, how do we reconcile these two points? You might think that relying on a big company is safer than relying on a small one when it comes to long-term project support. For example, if I were to set up a new smartphone, I wouldn’t want to use one from a tiny startup if I’m unsure they’ll be around in five years. If they go out of business, all my smartphone-related data could be lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "You would expect a larger, more established company like Google to be more reliable, but it turns out the same problem can arise with them. A service you become invested in might just be a small rounding error in their budget, leading to its termination at any time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think what sums up this situation well is something my friend says: Google is willing to launch new projects aggressively, but if that project doesn’t gain a billion users or generate a billion dollars, it’s likely to get cut. Just in the past few weeks alone, we’ve seen the termination of Google Domains, Google Jamboard, Google Podcasts, and Pixel Pass—active services that had various amounts of users, all abruptly discontinued. The further back you look, the longer the list grows. It feels almost like a running joke that Google announces and then kills a new messaging service every year. There are entire web pages dedicated to tracking the extensive list of things Google has terminated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember Google Plus? The Inbox app? Hangouts? A lot of people miss those, as well as Chromecast Audio, Stadia, and the list goes on. When Google ends these products or services, they often replace them or provide varying degrees of support for those affected. For instance, with Google Play Music, they subsequently launched YouTube Music, which had many overlapping features, so they made it easy to transfer your library from one to the other. While you might miss some features, at least you wouldn’t lose your entire music collection. \n",
      "\n",
      "A similar scenario happened with Google Podcasts. It was a solid app, but again, they wanted to incorporate those features into YouTube Music, so they worked on an import process and tutorials for that. While it's commendable to try and facilitate transitions, it's not always a perfect solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might not have heard of Google Jamboard, but it was used by my Ultimate Frisbee team for scouting documents and tracking players' tendencies. Now it’s gone, or at least by the end of the year, it will be. So we’ll have to find something else. \n",
      "\n",
      "Google Stadia, the gaming service, lasted only a couple of years. At least they allowed users to export their saved data and refunded everyone for games purchased when it was shut down, but there are still no alternatives. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a fun fact, I recently transferred my domain from Squarespace to Google Domains. I was nervous about the process, which took about 24 hours, but I finally completed it, and within a week, Google killed Google Domains and sold all domains back to Squarespace. \n",
      "\n",
      "The most surprising termination might be Pixel Pass. If you’re not familiar, it was a subscription plan launched alongside the Pixel 6 that let you pay $45 a month for a new phone, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music, Google One storage, and various other services. You would also receive a new Pixel for free every two years, which sounded fantastic for users of Google services. A lot of people signed up, but exactly 22 months after its announcement—just a month before the first upgrade cycle—the program was quietly terminated. No one received their promised phone upgrade, and no alternatives were announced. \n",
      "\n",
      "This behavior certainly erodes trust in Google. Personally, I was considering switching to Google Fi due to its integration with the Pixel, but I can’t be certain it will still exist in a year or two, so I’ve decided against it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The main takeaway here is that launching ambitious new projects is easy, but sustaining those projects long-term is far more challenging. The seven-year commitment to software updates for the Pixel is the most ambitious support plan we’ve seen in the smartphone market. This is what makes it so exciting yet difficult to believe. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I were at Google, I would genuinely want this promise to come true because it's a fantastic initiative. We hope that more companies recognize Google’s announcement and follow suit. Making devices more useful and secure for longer periods benefits everyone: the users, security, and the environment, as people will use their phones longer. If this pans out, the phones people buy today could be up to date until 2030, which is remarkable in the tech world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to commend Google for this ambitious promise, but it’s just that—a promise. Google has a track record of breaking promises, so we’ll have to wait and see. Will the Pixel still be around in seven years? We can’t know for sure. The Nexus program lasted five years before being discontinued, and we are now in year eight of the Pixel. Will it last another seven years? I’m uncertain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, this also connects to a mini trend I’ve noticed lately regarding tech companies announcing features that aren’t available at launch. This isn’t just limited to Google; it’s happening across the board. Devices are released, but many new features aren’t ready at launch, which means reviewers can’t test these features until long after the release. Google just did this with the Pixel; the Video Boost feature and Video Night Sight are both coming later.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t just a Google issue—Apple has done the same, notably with iPhone camera features. This year, they've again delayed several features, including the Journal app and the Airdrop transfer via the internet. Also, the much-hyped double tap feature for the Apple Watch is still in beta and labeled as “coming soon.” \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been mindful of these occurrences over the past couple of months, and they feel reminiscent of a trend in the gaming industry, where studios often release half-finished games, testing the waters and then patching them later. Releasing incomplete products, whether games or tech, is concerning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t appreciate this trend in tech and smartphones for several reasons. It complicates the review process—if the new features are unavailable at the time of the review, we can't evaluate the product fully. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve often said this: never buy a new piece of technology based solely on the promise of future software updates. Purchase it for what it is today, and if additional features are delivered later, it’s a bonus. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s all I wanted to share for now. I hope Google, Apple, and others are listening, and I hope they can deliver on their promises—especially the features they announce at launch. I’ll be keeping an eye on the Pixel. I’m currently testing the phones and will review them. Subscribe to see my review when it’s published. \n",

      "So every sport has some sort of technology involved in the show somewhere now, right? Tennis has the famous replay, the “in or out” graphic. American football has the digital line of scrimmage we all know. Soccer has this sweet new offsides graphic, and golf has the shot tracer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of you who have been subscribed for a long time already know this, but many of you don’t. I am a golfer. I’ve been golfing for a long time, longer than I’ve been doing anything else. My first ever YouTube upload, before any tech videos, was a couple of golf videos, believe it or not. \n",

      "- [Speaker] Come back, nice ball, good drive. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I still watch golf all the time, and of course, after doing that Formula 1 video, my brain is in tech-in-sports mode. I’m realizing the amount of technology hidden in plain sight on a golf course that makes a broadcast possible is actually insane. There are cameras, lasers, radar, LiDAR, optical fiber cables, and volunteers carrying Samsung phones with a custom app installed on them. There’s so much happening here! But why? \n",
      "\n",
      "When you think about it, there’s really one main reason for all this: golf is hard to watch, much like Formula 1. Unlike other sports, golf isn’t just one basketball court where all the action happens in the same place at the same time. It’s 18 different courts spread hundreds of yards apart, each with different action occurring simultaneously, all while a tiny white ball flies through the air and is nearly impossible to see. So, when you’re not physically at the golf course, there are basically three ways to watch golf, each requiring more technology than the last: the TV broadcast, the website portal, and then the Vision Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "(upbeat music) \n",
      "\n",
      "The TV broadcast is the simplest, right? But there’s still the major challenge of the golf ball being tiny and essentially invisible as soon as it’s hit. That problem is solved with the shot tracer. Many people don’t actually know how it’s created. It’s not a computer simply drawing a trace of where it “sees” the golf ball going; it’s very precisely measured. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve ever been near a golf course or watched a tournament broadcast, you’ll notice a ton of little towers. Well, they aren’t so little sometimes either. These towers are strategically placed all around the golf course—behind the tee boxes, around the fairways, and behind the greens—to cover the entire area. Each tower has three components: a camera, a TrackMan, and a wireless transmitter. \n",
      "\n",
      "The TrackMan is key; it is the radar system used to measure the exact launch speed, angle, and spin rates of the golf ball the moment it’s struck by a club. Once the measurements are taken, the computers instantly know everything about how that golf ball will fly through the air: how high it will go, how far, and how much it will curve. This information becomes even more useful further down the line, but for the TV broadcast, it allows them to immediately project a shot shape line over the hole using the angle from a fixed camera positioned right behind the tee box, sending that data back to the broadcast trucks. \n",
      "\n",
      "The really interesting part is that if you look around, you’ll see these towers all over the golf course—they're hidden in plain sight. Some are right next to the golfers at the tee box, and some are actually attached to TV towers. It’s not just at the tee boxes either; the TrackMan launch monitors actually face backward from behind the greens to capture launch data from all kinds of shots. It’s super impressive! \n",
      "\n",
      "I got to check out these towers, and it turns out they are all completely battery-powered, lasting for an entire day of a tournament. The skirt around the bottom is covered in solar panels, allowing them to recharge throughout the day. All of this is to provide us with the shot tracer, making golf on TV dramatically easier to watch. \n",
      "\n",
      "(upbeat music) \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, sometimes you can’t always watch golf on TV. Maybe you’re at work, or somewhere else where you can’t be in front of a TV, but you keep an eye on the PGA Tour website, watching for updates. Lucky for you, they’ve built out the web portal. The website has a real-time play-by-play portal where you can jump around to any hole and see exactly what is happening when it happens. During tournaments, every shot is updated in real time.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I didn’t realize until I saw it in person was just how far they go to deliver all of these updates as quickly as possible. There are a few more pieces of tech on the golf course worth mentioning. First, there are on-fairway cameras that cover the whole course. They’re similar to the tower I showed you at the tee box but without a TrackMan—just cameras pointed everywhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "Volunteers are stationed alongside every hole with laser rangefinders and tablets. They have a setup to quickly tag a ball once it lands and upload its exact location. Here’s how it works: \n",
      "\n",
      "A golfer is on the tee box, ready to hit their first shot. You’ve loaded the website. Remember how I mentioned those radar trackers can compute exactly what the ball will do the moment the club impacts it? Perfect! That data is transmitted to the ShotLink trailer in the parking lot, where feeds from all the cameras across the golf course are collected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s where it gets crazy: the instant the shot is hit, the system projects a polygon on the course where it believes the ball will land. You can actually see it outlined in yellow. A few seconds later, boom—the ball lands and rolls right into that box. It’s incredible!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the volunteer with the laser and tablet will use the laser to get the ball’s exact location to confirm it and upload it. It gets updated on the Tour website literally within three seconds of the ball coming to rest. It’s impressive! The most mind-blowing part for me was watching this system predict where the ball would land before it even did—accounting for launch angle, spin, speed, wind, temperature, humidity, and elevation to estimate the ball's probable landing area. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, it won’t always be perfect, especially if the ball does something unexpected, like hitting a tree or a bird. That’s why the volunteers are there—to finalize everything and submit the data. They told me the system actually calibrates itself over time. Every 10 shots, it gets even more accurate. I saw this in real time during the day. Earlier shots might be slightly off, while later shots were spot on. \n",
      "\n",
      "And there’s one more piece of tech on the golf course I haven’t mentioned yet. Following every group of golfers during the tournament, you’ll spot one volunteer holding a phone. At this tournament, the Travelers, they were easy to find because they wore pink shirts. What are they doing exactly? I found out they are all equipped with the same phone: a ruggedized Samsung Galaxy XCover6, suitable for the outdoors. \n",
      "\n",
      "They are keeping official scores for the online scorecard, and their fingerprint is used to close the betting windows for people gambling in real time on specific shots. They literally hold their fingerprint down on the screen until the moment a player begins their backswing. Then they release it to close the betting window. Here’s a clip of them doing exactly that: they wait for the player to hit, and then, as the shot is taken, the betting on that specific shot is locked in for whether it will hit the fairway or greens, or whatever the wager may be.\n",

      "Remember when the Vision Pro first came out and there were all those mockups of cool apps and experiences people wanted? One of them was Formula 1, with a dream F1 watching setup featuring the broadcast above and a mini-map of the cars on track below. It looked incredible, but it turned out it was just a mockup—no one had actually created it yet, except for the PGA Tour! \n",
      "\n",
      "The PGA Tour’s Apple Vision Pro app is insane; it’s built on that concept and it actually works! They have the leaderboard up top, a broadcast feed, and other elements if desired, but at the bottom, you can have a real-time mini-map of any hole on the course. This map is extremely accurate, created from drone footage taken days before the tournament.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the drone footage is imported and stitched together, you get stunning results. This is a flyover of the 10th hole, a 456-yard par four. You can see tons of details, like the other houses on the property, tee boxes, fairways, and even every single tree—including the iconic tree in the middle of the fairway. The cart path, hole placement on the green, TV towers, and spectator stands are all clearly visible, making it an incredibly detailed representation of each hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this tournament takes place, this is what you witness: a combination of all the technologies we’ve discussed—levels one, two, and now three. You see the broadcast in all its glory, the scoreboard updating in real time, and a full overhead view of any hole on the course where you can watch the shot flying through the air. The shot representations are accurate, reflecting if a player hits a low shot or a draw, fade, or high shot, as the launch monitor tracks all of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "This feels like a truly futuristic way to watch golf. It’s fantastic! Like Formula 1, the PGA Tour is at a new location every week for different tournaments, making it a massive logistical challenge to set all this up. Just seeing everything they bring in—from dozens of trailers to 10 to 20 miles of fiber running throughout the golf course, to drone footage mapping out every hole, grandstands, scoreboards, TrackMan towers, and TV towers—is impressive. \n",
      "\n",
      "They can’t do this for every single tournament, but they strive for it at as many high-profile events as possible. It was thrilling to experience this event in person and then see how golfers hit specific shots, how it looked on the broadcast, and how it was represented for those who couldn’t attend. \n",
      "\n",
      "For most sports, the broadcast is crucial. Only about 1% or less of the viewers are actually at the event. For everyone else, they learn and connect with the sport through the broadcast and media, and that’s what’s so amazing—how it continues to evolve over time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I remember about 30 years ago when the NHL tried something interesting with a glowing puck back in the mid-'90s, aiming to make it easier for viewers to follow the puck. It was well-intentioned but tough to execute, although it was kind of cool for its time. Nowadays, the technology has become so refined and precise that we can track a tiny white ball through the air over the length of three football fields with just a couple of yards of margin for error. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, all of this is designed to deliver an outstanding show, create an engaging broadcast, and allow golfers to compete for their tournaments. At the end of the season, they aim to win the FedEx Cup, the coveted end-of-year prize. I even got to touch the FedEx Cup—pretty cool! \n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, shout out to the PGA Tour for making this video possible, for pulling back the curtain, and letting us see behind the scenes. Nobody usually gets to witness this stuff, but now you have. Thanks for watching! Catch you in the next one. Peace. \n",

      "- All right, so the first thing I did when I got back from Australia was catch up on everything I missed. I put my SIM card in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and I was really impressed. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been so surprised, given how good the other Pixel 9s are. But still, folding phones are challenging to design, and the second generation of any product tells you a lot. Even though this is called the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it's technically the second one; the first Pixel Fold was released last year, and it was solid. It was one of my favorite foldables to use when closed, thanks to its passport-style aspect ratio, but it did have some trade-offs, particularly concerning its price. This new model makes some significant strides forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with the design. There was a lot of chatter about the camera bump on the back because of its appearance, which is admittedly a bit strange. However, it doesn’t bother me much. It’s not the biggest issue, although I do wish it was wider like the other Pixels for a more consistent look, similar to the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro. But you don’t focus on it for long, and I assume it looks this way due to the complex internals of a folding phone. The rest of the design, though, is quite nice. First of all, it’s much thinner, and they’ve flattened the sides all around, resulting in a more modern, squared-off shape like many other flagship phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, the rounded sides from last year actually made it easier to pry open the folding phone. You’ll notice this if you use both phones back-to-back, but it’s not a dealbreaker. There are numerous other refinements as well—the hinge is smaller, and the sides now have a matte finish instead of being glossy. So now you have matte sides and a soft-touch back. Overall, it feels much closer to a regular slab when it’s closed. It’s not fully there yet—we’re not fooling anyone—but it folds to just over 10 millimeters thick, which is comparable to many other phones released in the past year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main change, of course, is that it’s no longer the smaller passport size; it’s now a full flagship size with a 6.3-inch, 1080p, dynamic 120Hz AMOLED display. It’s big—the previous model was definitely easier to use with one hand. Now it’s more akin to the size of the OnePlus Open, right around the upper limits of what you can effectively use with one hand, though your mileage may vary depending on your hand size. There are also noticeable bezels all around the display, which pushes it slightly off-center. Nevertheless, I find it very usable and it feels more like a regular phone than ever before, which I consider a win.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like the cover screen. Upon opening it, the advantages of the taller aspect ratio become evident, as you transition from a 7.6-inch screen to a slightly narrower but taller 8-inch display that’s nearly square. The screen itself is significantly better, now offering up to 2700 nits brightness. It’s nice and bright and features LTPO technology, while the cover screen does not, for some reason. The bezels have also improved immensely from the first folding Pixel. They’re still a little thick, sure, but they are now evenly spaced all around the screen, and there’s a punch-hole cutout for the selfie camera in the corner instead of a thick bezel. Just look how thin that is—barely thicker than the USB-C port.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would have sounded insane just a few years ago, but I would wager that nearly everything about the hardware of this Google phone is at or above average, which is impressive. It’s as if the harder the component is to make, the better it becomes. The new hinge is smooth, allowing the phone to open and close in a very satisfying way, and it unfolds all the way flat with ease, unlike last year’s model. The crease in the middle is average at worst, but you can easily overlook it when viewing content on the screen. They’ve packed a 4650 milliampere-hour battery inside, which is slightly above average for foldables, even if it's a bit less than last year’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speakers in this thin body are impressive and full. The water resistance is rated IPX8, and the flatter fingerprint reader is quick and easy to use. Overall, this hardware feels worthy of the \"Pro\" designation more than ever before. Even though they renamed the phone to include \"Pro\" in the title, it truly feels deserving of it. However, some minor things, like the outer display not being LTPO, feel odd, especially since that's the one that does the always-on feature. Charging isn’t particularly fast, either, and it lacks Qi2, meaning that the phone has a lower-than-normal wireless charging coil, which can be tricky to line up and may not work with certain chargers. While that might seem like nitpicking, when you're talking about an $1800 device, you can be picky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design-wise, I feel they got a lot right. It reminds me of the OnePlus Open from last year, which won my best folding phone award. But this one is a Pixel, and the Pixel software experience really sets it apart from many other folding phone options out there. Sure, there are flashier foldables with advanced hardware from companies like Vivo and Xiaomi, and there are razor-thin devices with eye-catching specs. But if I’m being honest, the software on those devices typically doesn’t match the quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this phone, you get all the features of the rest of the Pixel 9 flagship lineup, which is fantastic. There’s call screening, the Pixel weather app, and all the new features—everything except the thermometer app, which is fine. Gemini is improving, like I noted in the Pixel 9 review, and I still love Circle to Search. However, on this inner screen, you need to be a bit more cautious since the distinction between \"hold to circle to search\" and the tiny swipe to bring up the dock can take some getting used to. There are also plenty of foldable optimizations, such as two-column layouts for various Android features, notifications, the settings app, and many first-party apps. I’ve been enjoying the larger screen because it enhances multitasking and allows multiple apps to be open simultaneously. Personally, I often use picture-in-picture mode with a small YouTube video while I read an article in full-screen mode; all of this is much better on this phone compared to last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "This runs on Android 14, which is the same as all the other new Pixels, but I’ve put the Android 15 beta on my old Pixel Fold, and it has some additional folding optimizations that I hope will be rolled out soon. Google promises seven years of software updates on the Pixel 9 series, which is impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve mentioned a lot of nice things about this phone, but even before I put my SIM card in, I was aware of two main downsides to consider: the underpowered Tensor chip and the downgraded camera system. Let's start with the cameras. Yes, they have smaller sensors than the standard Pixel models, and yes, the results aren’t as good, but they’re not terrible. The photo style remains consistent—contrasty and high dynamic range—but my main observation is that they lack sharpness. This issue becomes more apparent in lower light, where the photos tend to be softer and lose detail quicker because the smaller sensors struggle to gather enough light. I’d say it’s on par with a Pixel flagship from a couple of years ago, like the Pixel 7 Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s always been a compromise with high-end folding phones—they offer the same software features as other models, but for $1700-$1800, you’d expect maximum quality. However, fitting all the same camera sensors into a phone with additional hardware and a hinge can be a challenge. If photography is a major reason you buy phones, this might be a hard pill to swallow. But if your reasons for purchasing lie elsewhere and you’re not a big camera person, you may overlook this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I rely heavily on my phone for photos and videos, so that lack is tough for me. The other downside is the Tensor chip. Google’s Tensor has never been class-leading in terms of power or efficiency; I’d say it’s good enough for the phones it’s in. However, if you plan to do high-end gaming or want a phone that lasts for more than a few years or boasts exceptional battery life, then the Tensor chip holds these devices back. People are curious about when Google will compete with Qualcomm's flagship chips. The Tensor G4 in the Pixel 9 line, including this model, is solid and is paired with 16GB of RAM, which is great and certainly helps with AI tasks as well as running the rest of the phone. However, it’s not incredible, leaving you to wonder whether the phone will truly last for the promised seven years of updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rumors are circulating that the next Tensor chip might be the first fully custom chip designed by Google, manufactured at three nanometers, and could potentially represent the needed leap in power and efficiency. If you’re excited by that, you might want to wait. It's odd to say this is one of the best folding phones I’ve ever used while suggesting you wait, but I think you should consider it. You wouldn’t want to make a costly purchase and regret it next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if that doesn’t resonate with you, the phone as it stands today feels great. It looks great, performs smoothly, and I’ve experienced about six hours of screen time on average with mostly small screen activities. During the small percentage of time I open it for more significant use, the battery does drain a bit quicker. Nonetheless, I feel productive with this phone. It genuinely feels like I have two phones: a regular-size flagship when it’s closed and a mini tablet ready for multitasking and productivity apps whenever I need it. This has been an awesome device.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and speaking of being ready to go at any time, I wanted to mention that the new Ridge Wallet I designed is finally available. It’s a full-grain leather wallet that’s been well-received. It features RFID blocking, is lightweight, has two easy-access pockets, and can hold up to eight cards, along with cash if you like. I’ll link it below if you want to check it out. I’m really proud of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, if you’re not into foldable phones, this device might not change your mind. It has the same dimensions and functionality as its predecessor; it’s not a game changer. However, for foldable enthusiasts, this phone has been a joy to use. It feels like a full flagship when closed and a mini tablet when opened. Two phones in one—that’s the ideal foldable for me. This is my favorite flagship foldable that I’ve ever used. So there you have it; hopefully, Android 15 will come soon. Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace. \n",

      "All right, so you, like me, might have seen a lot of Formula 1 recently—lots of races, famous drivers, drama, and exciting stories. It's taken over my timeline on Twitter many times. A ton of you have been asking, \"Hey, are you watching? Are you paying attention to this stuff?\" So I finally caved, started watching, and I’m really glad I did. In this video, I'm going to tell you why I think Formula 1 is super cool, why I started watching, and why you should probably be watching it too. From the stories to the tech, to the innovation, to the race-day experiences—this is Formula 1 explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Mellow music)\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I want to give a shout-out to the sponsor, Bitdefender, for making this video possible. They reached out because they are a partner of the Ferrari team, featuring their logo on the car and the helmet. There are many parallels between the tech world, particularly in cybersecurity and safety, which we’ll discuss shortly. I’m so glad this was put on my radar because I love it now. While on the surface it's just a car race—which is already pretty cool—it's also the world’s highest-end tech competition. It’s like a science fair on wheels.\n",
      "\n",
      "At its core, Formula 1 is a year-long season of car races on different tracks around the world, and it has a long and rich history. I won't give you a whole history lesson, but the evolution of the cars from simple setups with just an engine and wheels to the aerodynamic masterpieces we see today, made from the most advanced materials, is fascinating.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most interesting aspect of F1, in my opinion, is that there are actually two championships going on at the same time each season: the Drivers' Championship and the Constructors' Championship. Every driver aims to finish the race as fast as possible, but each of the 10 teams has two active drivers. Points are awarded based on finishing positions, and these accumulate throughout the season for a champion. Additionally, the engineering teams behind each car are also awarded points that contribute to their own championship title.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what I mean when I say it’s a science fair. Every sport has rules, right? Like in golf, all your clubs need to meet specific regulations, and the basketball hoop is standardized. But having the best equipment in F1 is incredibly advantageous, and teams are actually encouraged to improve their equipment between races. There’s an ongoing push for innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "F1 is arguably the sport with the most technology involved. Teams are spending millions—hundreds of millions—of dollars on even the tiniest improvements to gain an edge. They're fighting for tenths and hundredths of a second. It’s incredible to witness. You don’t get from basic designs to advanced technologies quickly by accident. Substantial engineering and experimentation are involved in optimizing every part of each car to maximize speed and points within the rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there are still rules. The FIA, the governing body for F1, maintains a set of regulations that keeps everything fair and safe while encouraging innovation and tweaks. You can even look up the rulebook online; it’s a 183-page PDF. I'll leave a link below if you want to check it out. Within that document, there are a ton of interesting rules, including one that requires drivers to use at least two different tire compounds during the race, which I'll explain shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also several safety-related regulations. Every F1 car has an iron-reinforced ring above the driver's head called a halo. This isn't designed by the teams but by the FIA, and it must be used on every car from approved manufacturers. Although there was some initial pushback over its aesthetics, it has proven its value in terms of safety every year since its introduction in 2018. The halo can support the weight of another entire car and has saved lives in various incidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitdefender, a leader in cybersecurity, values innovation, safety, and quick reactions—qualities that align well with F1. It's fitting for their logo to be featured on the halo of the Ferrari car. They’re also present on the helmets.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are high-level rules governing the turbocharged V6 engines and gearboxes used in F1. One of the oldest and funniest rules to me is that all F1 cars have a plank of wood bolted to their bottoms to restrict how low they can ride for safety reasons. If it's too worn down after a race, that means the car was too low to the ground and it could be disqualified. So, every time you see those sleek, carbon fiber masterpieces racing around the track, just remember they also have a wooden plank underneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a comprehensive rulebook, all teams know the regulations. They independently work and spend millions trying out any little thing that might give their car an advantage. Naturally, since the competition is fierce, these teams are secretive about their developments. However, the beauty of it is that if one team discovers something that provides a significant advantage—even if it's just a fraction of a second per lap—other teams will eventually catch on, leading to a cycle of constant improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what exactly are some of these improvements? Each has an incredible backstory. One obvious example is wings. Believe it or not, F1 cars didn’t always have wings and relied solely on tire grip. But the concept evolved when engineers realized that a wing could push parts of the car down onto the track for more grip and faster cornering. What began as a small experiment soon led to the widespread use of front and rear wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another key advancement is KERS, short for kinetic energy recovery system. This technology captures energy from the spinning wheels and converts it into battery power for later use as a speed boost. Initially, teams faced challenges with its weight and reliability, but it has since evolved into today’s hybrid F1 cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's DRS—Drag Reduction System. While the aerodynamic features of the car provide downforce during turns, they can slow the car down in a straight line. The DRS allows drivers to reduce drag, improving speed. All cars are equipped with it, and specific rules dictate when it can be used to maximize racing excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been numerous technological innovations pioneered by engineers, including placing the engine behind the driver, monocoque chassis designs, ground-effect aerodynamics, and paddle shifters. Each of these contributes to the remarkable cars we see today. These vehicles corner with incredible grip, reach speeds of over 200 miles per hour on straightaways, and experience forces up to six Gs during braking and turning. This is why F1 is often referred to as \"the pinnacle of motorsport,\" and I wholeheartedly agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are technically faster cars, once you engage with turns, the difference in braking, grip, acceleration, and control becomes clear. It's a remarkable experience to witness in person. Seeing a Ferrari up close the day before racing started in Las Vegas was eye-opening. The car is larger and lower than one might expect, filled with intricate aerodynamic shapes and massive tires. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also got to try an F1 simulator in Bitdefender's Performance Zone in Las Vegas. The most noticeable aspect was how low you sit in the car—your feet are practically above eye level. Experiencing the immense speed firsthand is something the cameras can’t capture fully. The noise, smells, and the vibrations are all part of the experience that doesn't translate through broadcasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Bitdefender invited me to the Las Vegas Grand Prix to help create this video, I couldn’t say no. This race was the second-to-last of the 2023 F1 season, incorporating the vibrant atmosphere of Las Vegas. A key part of the race-day experience involves multiple days of events: practice, qualifications, and race day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practice days are an opportunity for teams and drivers to test setups. Each team has a limited time to send out drivers, allowing them to communicate adjustments based on their experiences: \"A little more downforce here would be good.\" Sometimes, they may need to make more extensive adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The practice day for the Las Vegas race was notably interrupted when a car hit a manhole cover so hard that it was sucked out of its place, damaging the car in the process. Teams had to work quickly to secure the manhole covers post-event.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next night features another practice session followed by qualifying. The qualifying process is straightforward—drivers aim for their fastest lap time. The fastest starts in pole position, while the slowest starts last. It’s an intense session, with three rounds of eliminations, narrowing down from 20 drivers to the top 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "During qualifying, the teams are monitoring real-time data as drivers race; everything about the car is displayed live on screens. Ferrari secured the top spots during qualifying, not a plan, just their speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Race day is where the excitement really kicks in. A typical race lasts about 90 minutes, covering 190 miles and usually 50 laps. Yes, they average over 100 miles per hour throughout, including pit stops. Speaking of pit stops, they are usually incredibly quick—taking only 2 to 4 seconds for tire changes, although repairs can take longer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Each team has predefined tires to use during races, which are regulated by the FIA. There's a range of tires from softest to hardest, with softer providing better grip but wearing down quickly. Drivers must strategize how to use different tire compounds during a race, which adds complexity to the competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s like chess, but the pieces are moving at 200 miles per hour through challenging curves. That's another reason Bitdefender aligns with F1; in cybersecurity, reacting quickly and adapting strategies is vital—similar to what drivers and teams do when racing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, all of the technology, strategy, and incredible machines come together for one goal: winning the race. Drivers maneuver to gain speed, utilize their machines' advantages for overtaking, and create an experience that's like art on wheels. There are plenty of highlights available on YouTube, and there's a Netflix documentary that showcases the sport beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, F1 has a significant impact outside of racing. High-end innovations for F1 cars often find their way into consumer vehicles. Many technologies—like DRS, paddle shifters, and carbon fiber—originated in F1 and have made it to the cars we drive today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, hosting a race can transform a city, somewhat akin to the Olympic Games. Some races are built into city streets, adding a unique flair and challenges. Winning or even participating in F1 is a tremendous marketing opportunity for the companies involved. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks again to Bitdefender and Team Ferrari for making this video possible. I learned a lot about them, including how Bitdefender technology protects Ferrari's top-secret innovations. Now that I’m a fan, I’ll be watching F1. I hope you enjoyed this video! My goal was to help you appreciate the races, engineering, and spectacle of what might happen next.\n",

      "All right, so the CMF Phone 1 by Nothing has a confusing name, but what this phone aims to do is not confusing at all. Love it or hate it, this is one of the most interesting new phones in the world right now. Nothing came along a few years ago and said, \"Hey, what if we tried to make an average budget phone but with a focus on software and design?\" And it kind of worked; those phones are pretty good. Now, CMF is the budget sub-brand of Nothing, and they've come along and asked, \"What if we did the same thing, but even more?\" That's how you end up with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a $200 Android phone that, on paper, doesn't really stand out in terms of specs among the sea of other $200 Android phones available, but it certainly stands out with its software and design. I want to start with the design first because that’s the most interesting aspect of this phone by a mile. The CMF Phone 1 is in black, and at first glance, it’s nothing too crazy. It has flat sides, fairly average bezels surrounding a large AMOLED display, and dual cameras located in the corner on the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are two notable features: first, there's a knob, or dial, in the bottom corner of the phone, and second, there are multiple metal screws around the edges. This is because the plastic back is completely removable and replaceable in a few different colors—there's black, orange, blue, and a light blue that can appear greenish, depending on one’s perspective. Right off the bat, this idea is quite unique for any phone, especially at this price. I remember back during the Moto Maker days when you could somewhat customize your phone, but that was much more permanent. It's been many years since we've had removable backs on phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the battery isn’t removable, and the back does feel cheap and flexible, once it’s attached to the phone, it feels pretty rigid and sturdy. It's neat to see the ability to change colors, and it offers a convenient upsell for the company selling the phone at such a low price. In the box with the cover, you also get a little orange combo SIM ejector tool and flat-head screwdriver since you'll need this tool to remove the SIM card tray and all the screws to detach the back. It comes with a matching SIM card tray and dial for a cohesive look, but you can mix and match if you want, which might make the phone feel a little more personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, regarding the knob I keep mentioning—initially, there was some speculation about its function. Is it a volume knob, a fidget toy, or a mappable feature? It turns out it's a mounting point for some accessories. It doesn’t spin freely; rather, it’s like a fancy thumbscrew with a colorful cap. You can replace it with one of three accessories they've made so far: a kickstand that props up your phone on a flat surface, a card holder wallet that lets you carry up to four cards with magnets on the back, or a lanyard option for those who prefer to have their phone hanging around their neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this a gimmick? I’d say no. The kickstand is genuinely something I'd want on my phone or to have the option available. This just adds another useful aspect to separate it from other $200 phones design-wise. It resembles an ultra-budget version of MagSafe, as instead of magnets you screw the accessory onto your phone. Interestingly, the magnetic accessory plate you screw under the back of your phone connects with the magnets in the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just for fun, I tried a MagSafe mount, and it held the phone surprisingly well. You could potentially use MagSafe accessories with this phone. It does take some effort—several screws, the SIM card ejector tool, and twisting—to switch these accessories, so this isn't something you'd likely do every day, but the option is there. When nothing is attached to the back, the dial protrudes the same amount as the camera bump across from it, preventing any wobbling. Well played, CMF.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they have many neat hardware customizations, another important aspect of a phone is how it performs in daily use. I've used the CMF Phone 1 for about a week, and honestly, it feels just like I'm using a Nothing phone, which is praise. It's running Nothing OS 2.6, and aside from the light-up glyph interface, it doesn't miss any features that the more premium Nothing phones have. It includes features like cloned apps for multiple instances of one app, Game Mode, and clever one-handed pull-down gestures for notifications, plus all the aesthetics like the icon pack, home screen widgets, and font. It even has a spot to view all your notification history, which is an underrated feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using this phone, I found there were times I'd forget I was using a budget device. It has a bright, responsive AMOLED display that typically ranges from 500 to 700 nits but can peak at 2,000 nits, and it has an adaptive refresh rate between 60 and 120Hz with a 240Hz touch sample rate, making it smooth and quick. For everyday tasks like scrolling through social media or reading emails, this phone performs exceptionally well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Powering everything is the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 5G, which benchmarks similarly to the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1. This is paired with either six or eight gigs of RAM, making it well-equipped for a $200 phone. However, this phone can certainly show its price point—it’s not perfect. These aren’t complaints, but rather facts about the trade-offs that naturally accompany such an affordable device. \n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, the phone features a 5000mAh battery with solid battery life, but there’s no wireless charging, and it doesn’t come with a charger in the box. While it supports charging up to 33 watts, it lacks NFC, has a subpar vibration motor, and a single mono speaker at the bottom that’s easy to block. The optical under-screen fingerprint sensor is impressive for this price range, but it’s often slow and sometimes requires multiple attempts to unlock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The removable plastic backs feel sturdy when attached, but they show their flimsy side when detached. The buttons feel like they’re barely held on, which raises concerns about their durability. Since the back is removable, the phone can’t be very water-resistant, only rated IP52—good for splashes, not much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the camera, the CMF Phone 1 has a 50-megapixel Sony IMX882 primary sensor that produces serviceable photos. It’s not terrible, but it lacks optical image stabilization, making low light photography challenging. The second sensor, however, is merely a depth sensor for capturing 2x portrait photos; it doesn’t significantly impact other photography tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Budget phones often come with sacrifices, and this one is no exception. However, I appreciate the trade-offs made in favor of good design and software. Looking back at it, it’s not a bad phone for $200. This device is primarily targeted at India, where it competes in a market with other budget options that tend to offer two years of software updates, three years of security updates, and large screens, all while typically lacking AMOLED displays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the competition, my experience was enjoyable; I often forget the phone’s price due to its smooth performance and feature set, which is commendable. It feels like a $200 phone designed to look cool. CMF has also unveiled other products, like a new smartwatch priced at $69 and a new set of earbuds for $59.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know your thoughts! That’s my review of the CMF Phone 1. Thanks for watching, and catch you guys in the next one. Peace.  \n",

      "So, this is the M2 Max MacBook Pro, and let's talk about it. This week, Apple updated the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros with a press release and an 18-minute YouTube video. The video featured a bunch of creators at the beginning, which was cool, and then showcased a pre-recorded event that looked like it was cut from another presentation. In fact, it’s rumored that this was taken from an event rumored to have occurred late last year. Honestly, I believe it; the URL and the video file name contained \"2022,\" and the AR files for the new laptops were compiled in October 2022, suggesting these products were ready months ago. But whatever, none of that matters now. What matters is that they're here, and what you need to know is that on the outside, they're basically identical, but on the inside, we have M2 Pro and M2 Max instead of M1 Pro and M1 Max, along with a few other minor improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first Apple Silicon MacBook Pros, released in October 2021, were some of the most universally praised computers I have ever encountered. They added back the ports, got rid of the touch bar, brought back MagSafe, and upgraded to an excellent high-refresh-rate mini LED display. The performance was incredible; I don’t think I’ve met a single person who got one and thought, \"Oh no, I made a mistake with this one.\" So, when a new model comes out a year and a half later, there isn’t a ton expected to change because the big leap was from Intel MacBook Pros to Apple Silicon ones. Now we're seeing more incremental improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can imagine, they're completely identical on the outside — same sizes, same colors. The only way I can differentiate my new one from my old 16-inch M1 Max is the custom skin I have on the back. Of course, channel sponsor dbrand is already selling skins for the 2023 model, so if you want your laptop to look a bit different from every other MacBook Pro in the world, then that’s your best bet; a link is below.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulk of what’s new comes from the new chip inside: M2 Pro and M2 Max. They maintain similar price tiers and configurations as before, but Apple is now quoting a 20% increase in CPU performance and a 30% increase in GPU performance. The model in front of me is a maxed out M2 Max with a 38-core GPU and the new maximum of 96GB of shared memory. Shocker — this thing is impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the hood, it's built on a new second-generation 5 nanometer process, and they’ve added some cores: two more high-efficiency CPU cores and three more GPU cores on the Pro model, making it a 19-core GPU on the M2 Pro and a 38-core GPU on the M2 Max. Also, the neural engine and media engine have been improved to handle machine learning and media playback and transcoding even faster than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're into synthetic benchmarks, I ran Geekbench 5, and the single-core score is now the highest I’ve ever seen at just over 2,000, while the multi-core score was north of 15,000. Here's some context to help you understand how impressive these numbers are. Yes, this aligns with the 20% CPU improvement we expected. In Cinebench, it also had a chart-topping single-core score, and here’s how the multi-core performance stacks up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall capabilities have been raised by 20 to 30%, which is great. But as I mentioned in my original M1 Max review a year and a half ago, it’s not just about raw processing power; it's about what those improvements allow you to do better or faster than before, hence the name “Pro.” \n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed this in key parts of my workflow. For example, I screen record with ScreenFlow, doing a full-resolution screen recording, then export that and bring it into Final Cut Pro. The exporting of the screen recording into ProRes 422 dramatically improved with the media engine introduced with Apple Silicon. A 16-core Intel Mac Pro with a Vega Pro II Duo, costing over $15,000, took 3.5 minutes to process a screen recording, while the M1 Max laptop did it in 32 seconds. The M2 Max managed it in just 23 seconds — a substantial improvement. Clearly, the previous machines weren't lacking, but Apple has taken everything that was good about the old ones and enhanced it, which is fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "For everyday, non-demanding tasks, as you can imagine, these laptops are still excellent. I’ve already told you about the exceptional mini LED display, which has a questionable amount of light bleed but still looks great most of the time. The design is top-notch with solid metal build quality, a huge trackpad, high-quality headphone jack, and the return of the built-in SD card slot — I've covered all that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, about those other minor improvements I mentioned earlier that aren’t related to the M2 chip: First, the additional efficiency cores are great for battery life. While I’m not seeing a dramatic difference, there is a claimed extra hour on both the 14-inch and 16-inch models. The laptops still support fast charging, and there’s now a color-matching MagSafe cable. This is a slight difference, as these laptops mainly come in silver or slightly darker silver shades, but now it comes in a darker space gray to match. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few other noteworthy features as well: WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1. I was surprised HDMI 2.1 was missing in the last version, so I’m glad it's now included, allowing for up to 8K 60fps over a single cable. WiFi 6E is just starting to roll out, which will be great for future-proofing. We recently got WiFi 6E routers in the studio, and the MacBook Pros have consistently been the fastest devices on our Wi-Fi network, continuing to extend that lead. Bluetooth 5.3 is also a welcome future-proofing upgrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Apple Silicon transition has come a long way since the first M1 Max, with many well-optimized apps and clearer benefits. It’s still not completely finished since we don’t have a Mac Pro yet, and it feels like they’ve neglected the iMac, which is still stuck on M1 for some reason. But overall, these laptops are a level up, and my recommendations about what to buy in the lineup remain consistent. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re focused on battery life, the M2 Pro will be fantastic. If you want maximum power at the expense of some battery life, then the M2 Max is likely your best choice. My conclusion is that these laptops aren't for those who already have M1 Pro and M1 Max laptops; they’re for people upgrading from older machines. Unless you’re one of the few who pushed their old models to their limits and needs that 30% more power, you know who you are. \n",
      "\n",
      "For those on older laptops, I suggest looking for sales on the M1 Pro and M1 Max because those will still be fantastic machines. \n",
      "\n",
      "You might have heard rumors about the first M3 laptops potentially arriving later this year on a 3-nanometer process, and you may wonder if you should wait for that. I would say, “Wait until Q3 of 2027” when the M5s come out, as they’ll be 30% faster than the M4s, which are 30% faster than the M3s — and you can see where this is going. If you’re going to wait for the next big thing, you’ll just be waiting indefinitely because that’s how technology is. \n",
      "\n",
      "These are great machines, and they exceed what most people need. If you can find M1s, they’ll be excellent for most users too. Either way, make sure to subscribe because I think the new M2 Mac Minis are a far more interesting machine. Stay tuned for that video. Also, I mentioned something in my last review: If the next version of this laptop still has a notch this big and doesn’t include Face ID, I’ll wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus. Surely, they must be planning to add it eventually, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, all day today, I’m a man of my word. Thanks for watching, and catch you in the next one. Peace.\n",

      "Enhanced: M2 Max MacBook Pro Review： Back to Bumps!.en.txt -> enhanced_transcripts/M2 Max MacBook Pro Review： Back to Bumps!.en.txt\n",
      "All right, so today I had the chance to check out and explore the new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models. As I was flying here, I thought about what Apple could possibly introduce with the 23rd iPhone that would be interesting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the iPhone, there were a number of other announcements at the Wonderlust event that Apple hosted, including several things that weren't even mentioned on stage. So, stay tuned and get subscribed to catch the full updates. For now, let’s focus on the new iPhone 15 and 15 Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming into this, it's clear that everything Apple has added to their newest flagship models can largely be divided into two categories: features that we've seen in other phones for years and ecosystem features that only work with other iPhones. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it’s worth keeping in mind as we discuss these updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iPhone 15 comes in the same two sizes as before: the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Plus. There are some minor changes, such as the slightly softened corner radii on the aluminum rails and the one-piece glass back that transitions between lighter and darker shades of the same color—like the new pink variant, which looks pretty seamless. Additionally, the entire lineup has a satin soft-touch finish instead of glossy, which I really like.\n",
      "\n",
      "The headline feature this year is definitely the switch to USB-C. Lightning is officially out, and these new iPhones now feature USB-C across the board. On one hand, this is a significant development; it marks the second port change in iPhone history, the first being the transition from the 30-pin connector to Lightning back in 2012. However, on the other hand, USB-C is something we’ve already seen in numerous laptops and tablets for years. I imagine it will take another year or two for the baseline iPad and the iPhone SE to adopt USB-C as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, it’s still surreal to see a USB port on an iPhone. So, what does this enable? Well, it's one cable that can ideally charge all your devices—your Mac, your iPad, your iPhone, your friend's Android phone, and even the new AirPods with their USB-C case. Oh, and you can now charge accessories like the new AirPods using a wired connection. While there's no wireless reverse charging now, you can use the USB-C to charge the AirPods directly from your iPhone battery, which is a nice touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Apple did hold back on one key feature, and they reserved it for the iPhone 15 Pro. More on that later. Aside from the USB-C, the iPhone 15 represents a moderately updated phone, featuring a slightly enhanced display with the addition of Dynamic Island and a higher peak brightness of 2,000 nits—double that of the iPhone 14.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main camera is now a 48-megapixel sensor, likely the same as what was in last year’s iPhone 14 Pro, along with all the benefits that come with it. The rest of the phone follows a familiar formula; the new baseline model essentially re-packages the previous year's Pro phone, powered by the A16 Bionic chip.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the coolest features is the next-generation portrait mode that automatically detects subjects in a photo and captures all the necessary depth information, allowing you to add that portrait effect later without having to remember to switch modes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Everything else remains consistent: the same sizes, ceramic shield, dust and water resistance, and starting prices of $799 for the 15 and $899 for the 15 Plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the Pro models—the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max—there are more updates to explore. Much of what I’ll want to test to validate their claims, so make sure to subscribe for full reviews later this month to determine if these phones are worthwhile. Most of the new features revolve around build quality, the chip inside, and the cameras.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, the Pro models feature a brand-new chip called the A17 Pro. This is the first time Apple has used the term “Pro” for an iPhone chip, and it represents their first three-nanometer chip, promising performance and efficiency improvements. They claim it offers about a 10% increase in high-performance core speeds and that the neural engine is now up to twice as fast. While some of these enhancements might not be immediately noticeable in daily use, having future-proofing and extra headroom is always a plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "A significant note regarding this chip is that it includes a new USB 3 controller, which means the 15 and 15 Plus models do not have this feature. The Pro iPhones' USB-C port will support faster data transfer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second, while the baseline iPhones will be stuck at the same USB 2.0 speeds they had with Lightning—480 megabits per second. While this probably won’t impact most users, it’s somewhat disappointing that not all devices will enjoy the full benefits of USB-C. For those shooting ProRes video or ProRaw photos, transfer times can still be an issue with the larger files.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, there is still no implementation of fast charging. Discussed previously on the “Waveform” podcast, many expected that switching to USB-C would present Apple with a great opportunity to introduce better charging options. Yet, we continue to see the same 20-watt charging, which means charging still takes about an hour and a half to two hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the new design of the Pro models has garnered a lot of praise. Apple transitioned from shiny stainless steel rails to a new grade 5 titanium alloy with a brushed texture. This change makes the devices noticeably lighter—something I appreciate. Additionally, this design update allows the Pro iPhones to be slightly slimmer, resulting in closer screens to the edges and thinner bezels, which I definitely notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s been talk of improved strength, but I think the impact may be overstated. The Pro iPhones have used stainless steel rails for some time, and while titanium is technically stronger, the reality is that when dropped, it’s often the glass that breaks. The ceramic shield glass on the iPhone 15 Pro has remained unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of color options, you have black, white, a subtle new blue, and a natural finish that embraces the raw titanium look—similar to a warm tone reminiscent of last year’s \"Starlight.\" Surprisingly, I might actually prefer this natural finish the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another noteworthy mention from Apple’s keynote was the design change to the interior chassis, aimed at making the back glass more easily replaceable. This is a small but positive step towards improved repairability for the iPhone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's talk about my favorite feature: the new action button, which is customizable and replaces the iconic mute switch. It’s located in the same spot and functions similarly—a long press switches between mute and ringer. However, diving into settings, you’ll find a comprehensive list of options for this action button.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can keep its traditional function, switch between focus modes, auto-launch the camera in your desired mode, enable the flashlight, open voice memos, or even toggle the magnifier. The last option allows you to trigger a series shortcut, which can launch any app on your phone. While there might be a slight delay in opening apps, it’s a great feature that expands usability for the button.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the camera upgrades across the board include a larger 48-megapixel main sensor for the Pro models and an improved ultra-wide lens. The Pro Max model gets an intricate folding 5X telephoto camera, and the regular 15 Pro retains the 3X telephoto from last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, there’s a new setting allowing users to change their default focal length to 1X, 1.2X, or 1.5X. Although somewhat hidden in the camera settings, it allows for quick access to your preferred focal length whenever you open the camera app.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, many people feel that the biggest new feature of this year’s iPhone is the transition to USB-C. I still have a few Lightning accessories, such as the MagSafe Duo, AirPods Max, and Magic Trackpad, so I’m curious to see if new USB-C accessories will emerge following this change.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, our sponsor, Anker, has created a new lineup for the iPhone 15, including the Anker Nano—a compact but powerful USB-C power bank that provides 30 watts of output and a small display to indicate remaining battery percentage or charging time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iPhone 15 Pro will start at $999, the same price as last year, but the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,199 and is the only model with the 5X camera. It will also have a starting storage option of 256GB—removing the previous $1,100 tier. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you’re interested in these new iPhones—are you indifferent, eagerly anticipating a purchase, or waiting to see if reviews prove they’re worth it? The comment section is always open. Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Don’t forget to subscribe! Peace.\n",

      "So, do you remember about a year ago when Dyson launched those peculiar Dyson Headphones Combo Wearable Air Purifier gadgets? I tested them, reviewed them, and despite giving them a fair chance, they ended up being the single dumbest product I’ve ever reviewed. And they still are. \n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine my surprise when Dyson unveiled a new product a year later, and it’s just headphones. They’ve removed the absurd air purifier part and left behind the large metal pair of Dyson headphones that somewhat got overshadowed last time. These are the headphones, and they retail for $500.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, of course, I’m going to give them a try. There may be someone out there who was put off by the air filter feature but is still intrigued by the concept of high-end Dyson active noise-canceling headphones. I’m dedicated to providing a fair review.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might not make much sense initially, but consider that AirPods Max also exist. The more you compare them, the clearer it becomes that Dyson seems to have aimed to outdo Apple’s headphones in every conceivable way, while still fitting into the same category of heavy noise-canceling headphones. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned, these headphones retail for $500, which is $50 cheaper than Apple’s. They have replaceable ear cups at $50 a pair—believe it or not, that also undercuts Apple. The rated battery life is an impressive 55 hours, dramatically better than AirPods Max's 20 hours. Plus, Dyson headphones work seamlessly on both iPhone and Android, and they actually feature a real off button.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, starting with the weight—these headphones are somehow heavier than Apple’s. They are the heaviest headphones I’ve ever tested at 451 grams, which doesn’t sound great on paper. However, they do distribute that weight well across your head. Everything in these headphones is metal, not just the ear cups, but also the hinges and the top band, except for the super soft top cushion. The left and right ear cushions aren’t as soft because they house the batteries. This weight distribution is why they can be just as comfortable as AirPods Max. They feel different, but the comfort level is acceptable for casual listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s genuinely a lot of interesting and sometimes clever design in these headphones. The standout feature is the interchangeable back plates and ear cushions. Don’t worry; I’ll get to the sound quality. These ear cups can be replaced with a simple quarter twist, and the back material is a cap that’s also just a quarter twist away from being replaced. This allows you to mix and match colors, but you don't get a bunch of them with the headphones. As previously mentioned, they’re $50 each.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you visit their website, you choose between four base color combinations. Choose wisely because extra options come at a price. You might have seen what people did a few years ago by mixing and matching ear cup colors with AirPods Max. Dyson seems to have taken that idea to the next level, integrating it as a feature and offering add-ons. It’s fine; it works. Is it a bit gimmicky? Maybe, but you can tell that the lock-and-twist mechanisms are well-designed, ensuring they stay in place yet can be easily swapped out for new caps, which have various finishes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another clever design feature comes from the previous Dyson headphones—a joystick on the back right side. This joystick serves as most of the physical controls, and it’s excellent. You can press it to play or pause, use it to adjust volume, and move left or right to navigate tracks. It sticks out, making it easy to find without looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only other physical control is double-tapping the left ear cup to toggle noise cancellation or transparency mode. Unfortunately, this feature is finicky and only works about 50% of the time. This is not a touch surface; it’s just a cap on the headphones, so you have to apply decent pressure to activate it, which isn’t great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the chime that plays when you first put them on is surprisingly loud. I don’t know why it has to be that way, but it could definitely use a volume adjustment. The headphones only twist in one direction to fold flat, but they don’t actually fold completely. You’ll need a case to transport them. While you don’t necessarily need this case—it’s essentially two flat pieces of silicon connected by elastic—you do have to compress the headphones slightly to fit. There’s also one small pocket at the top for any cables you want to carry.\n",
      "\n",
      "These headphones come with on-head detection, allowing them to automatically play when you put them on and pause when you take them off. This is pretty standard for high-end headphones. They also offer multi-point connectivity, letting you pair with both your iPhone and Pixel simultaneously. The Dyson app is decent; it lets you change modes and see a graph of the last 30 seconds of sound levels outside versus inside the headphones while using noise cancellation. It may not be the most useful function, but it’s interesting to look at occasionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s talk about how they sound. They are, after all, headphones, and that’s what people want to know. As your resident non-audiophile, I can say they sound solid but not amazing. While I compared them back-to-back with AirPods Max, which seems like the appropriate comparison, the AirPods sound better in virtually every genre, by about 10 to 25%. You can adjust the EQ in the Dyson app, but there are only three presets: Neutral, Enhanced, and Bass Boost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The neutral setting is surprisingly flat and honest. The Enhanced setting sounds closest to AirPods Max and works well for music, offering a nice range with deep bass and crisp mids and highs. On the other hand, the Bass Boost setting sounds terrible, but if you're into that, it delivers. The main issue is creating a wide sound stage; the ear cups are quite shallow, often touching my ears, which limits instrument separation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, they perform like solid B+ noise-canceling headphones at a $300 price point. They feature eight microphones for active noise cancellation, which is decent for reducing white noise, but they don’t outperform competitors like Sony, Bose, or AirPods, which all excel at canceling background noise. The transparency mode is acceptable but not exceptional.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there’s one standout feature, it’s definitely the battery life. The clever placement of the battery on the headband, rather than resting on your ears, makes a notable difference. I’ve only had to charge them once after a week and a half of heavy usage—over 50 hours with noise cancellation on, which is impressive. Plus, they have an actual off button, which isn’t a standard feature for all headphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, at the end of the day, these are still Dyson headphones. The burning question is, why do they exist? The obvious Business 101 answer is that Dyson invested considerable R&D funds in the earlier air purifier headphones and decided to pivot to something with a larger market: regular headphones. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you compare these directly to AirPods Max, they don’t seem as ridiculous. They’re built well, offer clever customization features, decent sound, solid physical controls, and superior battery life. But if you stack them against other high-end noise-canceling headphones in the $350 range from other brands, they do seem overpriced.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that’s my verdict. Now you know. At least Dyson can say they produced something worthwhile. Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you in the next one. Peace.\n",

      "- Okay, I've been waiting for this for a while. As someone who has been on the sidelines of the Windows game for a little bit now and seeing all this hype around this new matte black laptop that’s supposed to be generational, it's got me thinking: is it legit? Have Windows laptops actually caught up to the Apple Silicon leap from a couple of years ago?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a new Microsoft Surface laptop, and it doesn’t have an Intel chip inside, nor does it have an AMD chip. This laptop has a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip, meaning it is an ARM laptop. Years ago, Apple transitioned from Intel chips to ARM chips, and it was incredibly successful. No one could really match their efficiency and seamless vertical integration; the overall package of their laptops took a quantum leap forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Windows laptops tried something similar around the same time, and I don't know if you remember the Surface Pro X, but that didn’t go so well. We’ve continued to have Intel and AMD laptops since then. However, it seems like this one has gone much better. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, I’ve been using this laptop for the past couple of weeks, and you might have seen me with it on the Waveform Podcast. I’ve developed a pretty good idea of what’s gone well and what still poses some trade-offs. \n",
      "\n",
      "The big advantage here—the major leap forward—was efficiency. In a laptop with the same size battery, this translates to dramatically improved battery life, and this laptop saw a significant boost. I remember reading reviews of the last Surface laptop with an Intel chip, which already had solid battery life, and Microsoft quoted it at 19 hours. This one’s quote is 23 hours, and what that has translated to for me is all-day battery life for mixed use with no worries. I can do high brightness web browsing, email, watching videos, and research activities, and still end the day at around 40% easily. I hardly think about charging, which is awesome for a 14-inch laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "On paper, it’s getting compared a lot to the M3 13-inch MacBook Air, and it even outlasts it in some synthetic benchmarks, which is great. So that’s definitely one success—check that box for great battery life. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second success we were looking forward to is just well-optimized performance. This isn't about super high-end gaming performance; instead, I'm referring to general smoothness, consistency, and rock-solid performance across all your everyday tasks. I’ll get into app support in a moment, but I found this to be a very capable laptop. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been out of the Windows scene for a bit, so I don't have as many reference points. But this is a $2,000 14-inch laptop that can handle everything I throw at it without breaking a sweat. Photo editing in Affinity? Not a problem. Anything in the Microsoft Office Suite? No problem, whether plugged in or not. The trackpad gestures feel pretty smooth, and the graphics of the whole UI are consistent from full battery to nearly dead. Using software that runs natively on it is snappy and a great experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this brings us to the downside of switching to ARM, which is something I was curious about since the last time we saw this transition. The number one challenge in changing the entire architecture of a computer is app compatibility. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the Mac transitioned, there were three types of apps. The first type includes optimized apps, which is ideal—most first-party apps were optimized from the start. Apple did significant work to get as many developers on board to optimize their apps for ARM. Then there are apps built for x86 that still work on ARM through emulation. They don’t perform as well as they could, but they technically still function. Finally, there are apps that just don’t work at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, for Windows on ARM, you have those three types of apps again. My assessment is that there’s pretty good support for native apps regarding everyday usage, but it’s definitely still not perfect. \n",
      "\n",
      "Apps like Photoshop and Lightroom CC run natively; Chrome, Spotify, Prime Video, Dropbox, Zoom—there are plenty of popular apps that run smoothly and don’t drain the battery much, which I love. Then there are some apps I use that don’t natively support Windows on ARM but still run through emulation. Lightroom Classic is one example, as is my to-do list app of choice, TickTick. You might have heard about it; it’s a great example. The website only has x86 versions of the app. I downloaded and ran the 64-bit version, and while it technically works, it doesn’t run very well. I noticed some real lag in certain parts of the UI, even though it’s just a to-do list app. \n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a long list of apps in this limbo phase where you don't know if an ARM native version will come out because adoption isn’t super high, so there's not much incentive for developers to create one. The emulated versions may churn through battery a bit faster, but they still work. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are apps that don’t work at all yet. For instance, the Arc browser and Google Drive on desktop—two apps I rely on heavily—have no compatibility with Windows on ARM. VMware doesn’t work, many VPNs don’t work, and a lot of games are incompatible. Some games won’t run simply because they have anti-cheat software that doesn’t function on Windows on ARM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, some apps that are actually compatible don’t have their ARM versions prominently displayed on their websites, which makes them hard to find and understand. So, it’s kind of all over the place right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "My take is this: if you’re considering a Windows ARM laptop, specifically look up the apps you need to use and ensure they’re at least compatible, or at least emulatable. There may be promises of ARM versions coming soon or statements from developers you might see, but make sure to verify that the programs you need will work. Depending on who you are, you could be totally covered or completely out of luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a couple of Windows ARM laptops out there; this is the one I chose to work with—the premium matte black one with the Snapdragon X Elite. Here are a few more observations from my couple of weeks of using it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The build quality is pretty awesome, which has been consistent with Surface devices for a while now. I love the all-metal design, and the keyboard is rock solid. The large trackpad has excellent haptics, providing very good fundamentals all around. The port selection is adequate; it still includes a full-size USB-A and two USB-C ports, along with a headphone jack. \n",
      "\n",
      "One downside I see, especially given the price, is the lack of an OLED option. Instead, it features a 2304x1536 120Hz LCD touchscreen with a 3x2 aspect ratio. I appreciate the taller screen, but it can’t quite match the deep blacks and contrast of an OLED, even though it's a pretty good LCD. I feel like I basically traded OLED for a high refresh rate here, but I would have liked to see an OLED option available.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not a super high-end gaming PC. It performs very well across the board and manages all other tasks, but like Apple’s M Series laptops, it has a built-in GPU that won’t be as powerful as a dedicated GPU. You can still play some games, but don’t expect to max out frame rates in \"Elden Ring\" or something. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you study the benchmarks, you’ll find that these chips have a lot of cores but weaker individual performance on a single-core basis. They are good at handling lots of cores at once, so while that’s appealing, just keep that in mind. It generally stays cool and doesn’t spin up the fans, which I think is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, this is one of the very first Copilot PCs, so there’s a dedicated Copilot button on the keyboard. This chip features an NPU, specifically for AI-related processing. This includes functionalities like the studio camera effects built into the camera and the forced artificial eye contact feature, all executed without pulling power from the CPU or GPU. You can also hit that Copilot button to interact with Microsoft Copilot, asking it anything in a manner similar to how you might interact with Bing, ChatGPT, or Gemini.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I think this laptop is a good start. Personally, I’ve been waiting for a premium matte black Windows laptop on ARM, and this is it. The main question you need to consider is whether the software you rely on works on ARM—that’s crucial when deciding if you should purchase one of these laptops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, before you go, I have a question: Have you ever looked at a laptop or a smartphone and wondered what’s going on inside it? Because channel sponsor dbrand has your answers. For years, one of my favorite party tricks has been using this sheet of magnet paper. You simply lay it down on any device to reveal where a few of the internals are, like the MagSafe magnet array or the speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "dbrand’s X-ray line takes this magnet paper experience to another level, allowing you to see virtually every single component inside your device. Yes, this is an actual X-ray of that device. dbrand took hundreds of devices to a metrology lab and shot each one with a special X-ray machine for maximum accuracy. They also created a light mode version of each X-ray. Personally, I prefer the dark mode version, but if you don’t want to choose, buying any X-ray skin gets you the other colorway for free with your order.\n",
      "\n",
      "If that sounds like a good deal to you, I’ll leave a link for you to check it out below: dbrand.com/x-ray.\n",
      "\n",

      "All right, we need to talk about folding phones for a moment, as they have changed significantly since the last time we discussed them. This week marked the release of the first-ever folding phone from OnePlus, called the OnePlus Open. While the name may not be the best, the device itself is an impressive first-generation foldable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been using it for about three weeks and have lots of positive feedback. In fact, I think it's so good that it has revived the old question in my mind: What will it take for regular people to start buying folding phones? Yes, I like this phone, and I suspect that other reviewers and enthusiasts will appreciate it too, and this video may garner a lot of views. However, none of that necessarily means that everyday consumers will actually walk into a store or browse online to purchase one.\n",
      "\n",
      "First things first: let's talk about the details of this phone. It's a high-end device in every aspect, with a particularly well-considered design. The OnePlus Open is roughly the same size as a regular phone on the outside, featuring a 6.3-inch, 20:9 cover display that just exceeds 1080p. It uses LTPO technology, which allows it to scale down to 10 hertz, and it boasts an impressive maximum brightness of 2800 nits within fairly thin bezels. This display now holds the record for the brightest screen I've ever seen in a smartphone, and I would say it shares the crown for the best foldable to use while closed with the Pixel Fold.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I still prefer the button placement and reachability of the Pixel Fold, given that it's slightly shorter, the OnePlus Open undeniably feels like a flagship device even when closed. I appreciate several design touches, including the flat sides that give it a clean look. The alert slider is back, positioned at the top of the phone, making it somewhat difficult to reach, but it functions just as you’d expect, similar to previous OnePlus phones. The power button also serves as the fingerprint reader, which we've seen on other foldables as well, and it's fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The back of the phone is a mixed bag for me. I'm not a fan of the faux leather finish, as it reminds me of Samsung's designs from 2016. However, it does hide fingerprints well. There's also a new color option in green, which looks a bit cleaner. The prominent camera bump is another standout feature; while it's quite the visual statement, it serves as a comfortable rest for my index finger when holding the phone closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opening the phone reveals why OnePlus took their time to release a foldable device. The internal display is a stunning 7.8 inches corner to corner, using LTPO 3.0 technology that ramps up to 2800 nits and down to 1 hertz. The bezels are uniform all around, with a hole punch in the top corner, and it has one of the least visible creases I've encountered in a folding phone in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a bit debatable whether we can truly call this their first foldable phone, as OnePlus's sister company OPPO already has a foldable on the market. The recently released OPPO Find N3 shares many features with this phone. Regardless, with the screen on, the crease is virtually invisible, and even when the display is off, you have to look closely to find it. This device looks impressive from nearly every angle in regular use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hinge mechanism allows the phone to stay at any angle, whether you're going for a 90-degree position or something more open or closed. It shuts with a satisfying spring-loaded clap. The OnePlus Open is impressively thin—not the thinnest I've seen, but still commendable. Surprisingly, it's lighter than you'd expect, weighing roughly the same as an iPhone 14 Pro with a stainless steel finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of software, the OnePlus Open runs on OxygenOS 13.2, featuring various tweaks and functionalities that power users will love. This device clearly caters to power users, offering seamless continuity between the open and closed screens. Once you finish using an app, you can close it and resume on the outside screen, similar to the Pixel Fold. The home screen setup mirrors automatically between the cover and inside screens, which keeps them organized, although I wish I had the option to alter that setup since I'm a power user.\n",
      "\n",
      "The multitasking capabilities on the inside screen are significant, letting you run multiple apps simultaneously. You can use one app full screen or have two apps side by side and include a third in a triple-panel view. Quick app switching and the ability to see all open apps with a four-finger pinch make this a well-designed hub for productivity. When I open this phone, I feel ready to tackle my tasks efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "The OnePlus Open hits all five of my pillars of excellent smartphones: great screen, great battery, great build, great performance, and great camera. I truly mean that it excels in each area. The screens match well inside and out, and performance is top-notch with high-end specs, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB of fast RAM, and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. The dual 120Hz LTPO displays offer a 240Hz touch sample rate, ensuring responsiveness and a future-proof feel. Battery life is excellent with a 4800mAh battery and 67-watt fast charging, though it lacks wireless charging, which seems like a missed opportunity given that many competitors now offer it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The large camera module suggests high-quality cameras, and testing confirms that the setup is decent. The configuration includes a new stacked sensor for the main camera, a 3x telephoto lens, and an ultra-wide lens. Most of the time, it performs well, but it struggles with motion capture. If you're photographing moving subjects, the shutter speed may not be fast enough, requiring you to switch to action mode, which increases the shutter speed but also raises the ISO, resulting in noisier images.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't one of my five pillars, but I found the microphone quality surprisingly good, which is often not the case with smartphones. Overall, the OnePlus Open combines all these features into a device that I believe many people, myself included, will enjoy using.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, why do I think folding phones aren't being purchased as much, despite their quality? A phone can excel in all five pillars and still not appeal to the mainstream for various reasons: first, the price; second, durability concerns; and third, the notion that these phones are targeted toward power users.\n",
      "\n",
      "This phone is priced at $1700, which is a significant amount of money for a smartphone, regardless of payment options. It's literally twice as expensive as an iPhone 15. However, it aligns with its folding competitors—like the Pixel Fold and Samsung Z Fold 5, both priced at $1800. In that context, this phone could be seen as a bargain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Durability is another concern. While there are tests backing up its durability, such as a million-fold hinge rating and IPX4 water resistance, I’ve started to notice dead pixels near the hinge on my unit after just three weeks of careful use. This doesn’t guarantee everyone will experience the same issue, but it raises questions about long-term durability compared to traditional smartphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, folding phones are primarily geared toward power users. While folding and unfolding features are exciting for tech enthusiasts, they don't necessarily drive high sales volumes. We've seen similar patterns with LG and Sony, who focused on advanced camera features but struggled with overall sales. It wouldn't surprise me if folding phones are not leading sales in any company's lineup.\n",
      "\n",
      "An impressive piece of folding phone hardware I've seen is the HONOR Magic V2. It's sleek and boasts high-end specs, a thin profile, and minimal crease visibility when opened. However, despite its attractions, it still faces the same challenges for regular consumers: price, durability, and the added thickness of a foldable phone compared to a standard one.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are inching closer to mainstream acceptance with flip phones like the Samsung Z Flip 5 priced at $1000 and the new Motorola Razr 40 expected to launch at $600. However, we need more options like these for folding phones to gain wider appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, while folding phones have evolved dramatically, there's still a long way to go before they become mainstream. Until then, they remain a source of excitement for tech enthusiasts. Thank you for watching! Catch you in the next one. Peace.\n",

      "- All right, there’s just one thing starting to feel a little weird with this new Pixel, but I’ll get into that by the end of this video. Let’s start with the obvious stuff: what’s actually new here? \n",
      "\n",
      "I just got some hands-on time with Google’s new budget phone, the Pixel 8A, and I can confirm they’re mostly sticking to the script and keeping it simple. Last year’s phone was already really good, making a few key improvements where it counts while keeping the price the same at $500. \n",
      "\n",
      "Five hundred bucks isn’t cheap, but it’s not a flagship either. It’s definitely in this nice mid-range territory, and it feels like the Pixel has been gradually catching up its hardware with the rest of the competition in this price range.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first glance, it is unmistakably a Pixel, featuring the camera bar at the top. However, there’s a slight change: the edges are a bit more rounded. I really hope I’m not the only one getting round-SpongeBob vibes from these corners, but that’s definitely what I see. That’s the main design change on the back. \n",
      "\n",
      "It still has wireless charging and retains the same main camera sensor as the Pixel 7A, with an ultra-wide lens next to it. But now, there are new colors and a matte texture. There are black and white options called Obsidian and Porcelain, which look pretty tame. However, there are also vibrant new colors: green and blue called Aloe and Bay. \n",
      "\n",
      "The rails and the camera bar are still made of aluminum. It retains an IP67 rating and features a slightly larger battery. We’re talking about a very slight increase from 4,385 mAh to just over 4,400 mAh, but it still supports wireless charging.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the inside, it’s been upgraded to the new Tensor G3 chip from last year’s flagships. We know it’s decently capable, albeit a bit inefficient, and it’ll start with 128 GB of storage. For the first time, they’re also offering a 256 GB version of the A phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Around the front, there’s an improved display. It’s still 6.1 inches in size with the middle hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera, and it still has an optical fingerprint reader. But now it features an Actua display, which has a peak brightness that’s 40% higher than before, and that difference is noticeable. This is one of those things that impacts everyday usability, especially in outdoor visibility. \n",
      "\n",
      "The display is now a pOLED that supports up to 120 Hz instead of the 90 Hz from last year. Now, before you start typing, I know a lot of people will argue that this doesn't make much of a difference to most Pixel buyers, and… you’re right. In fact, many won't notice this improvement because Smooth Display is actually off by default. So it's a 60 Hz phone out of the box, and you have to know to go into the settings to turn it on, while also being aware that it will impact battery life. Even once you enable it, it’s not locked at 120 Hz; it’s dynamic instead. \n",
      "\n",
      "I played around with this phone for a bit, and it did feel very smooth to me. Personally, I'm happy about that change, but I won’t dwell on it much longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "You already know what a Pixel is, right? This is the mid-range/budget version of the phone, packed with great software. This model includes really smart AI features like Call Assist, Pixel VPN, Magic Eraser, and many other classic Google features. It offers impressive speech-to-text transcription speed and accuracy, allowing you to write emails, texts, notes, and entire paragraphs quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "It also promises seven years of updates: OS updates, security updates, and Feature Drop updates. Plus, it comes with really good cameras, which are mostly unchanged from last year. The Pixel 7A even received the highest Elo rating in our recent blind smartphone camera test, which involved millions of votes against other top-tier flagship phones, so that’s a solid baseline.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems like a pretty safe and easy choice if you’re a Google or Pixel fan. However, I do have some concerns about this Pixel. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, this is the first A series device that will support Gemini Nano, the feature that can run locally on the device, which is great. They’ll probably make a big deal about it at the event and discuss it more at Google I/O and such. However, there’s now a weird inconsistency with different assistants on the Pixel phone. This isn't just with this phone; you now have the Gemini app prominently displayed on the home screen of the Pixel 8As, showcasing the latest voice and multimodal AI search capabilities. Right next to that, tapping the mic on the Google Search page leads you to a separate but equally capable Google Voice Search with Google Assistant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Google is literally developing two different assistants side by side, with overlapping but not entirely congruent capabilities. It’s a bit strange and inconsistent. We saw this coming and knew it would happen, but eventually, they’ll likely need to consolidate everything into one. I suspect that Gemini will eventually handle everything. \n",
      "\n",
      "On another note, consider the price. This phone is launching at $500. It’s a mid-range phone at a mid-range price, and everything seems reasonable. However, keep in mind that you can still buy last year’s phone of the year, the brand-new Pixel 8, for $550. So, the Pixel 8A is not that much cheaper than the 8. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you choose the Pixel 8, even if it’s a couple of months older, you’ll get a phone with slimmer bezels, a brighter, higher-quality display, arguably better cameras with bigger sensors, a larger battery, faster charging, IP68 rating, and the same Tensor G3 chip. Isn’t that a better deal? If you can find a used Pixel 8, all the better. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Pixel 8 was just such a good phone for that price that it makes both more and less expensive phones seem like worse buys. I mentioned how the Pixel 8 Pro feels like such a tough sell at $250 more, but now it makes the Pixel 8A look a bit overpriced. \n",
      "\n",
      "Either way, I’m sure the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, when released, will shake things up. But right now, the Pixel 8A is a solid mid-range device with all the features you expect from a Pixel. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re planning to pick one of these up, channel sponsor Dbrand has you covered with their Hydrodip skins. I’ve been using Dbrand skins since 2013, so over a decade now. They don’t add any thickness like a case would, but they can completely change the look and feel of your device. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dbrand supports almost 200 devices with their Hydrodip skin, including phones, laptops, tablets, consoles—you name it.

      "If you’re a screen enthusiast, you’ll want to consider this. The S24 Ultra features one of the best displays available, dropping in a class-leading 6.8-inch quad HD AMOLED display that is simply outstanding. These ultra phones have had 120Hz LTPO for a while, but now, it’s completely flat and significantly brighter. It reaches a maximum brightness of 2,600 nits, making it great for outdoor use, yet it can dim to low levels at night without the banding issues found in some other devices. The display is pushed right to the edges, featuring some of the thinnest bezels we’ve seen. Plus, there’s a new anti-reflective coating on the Gorilla Glass Armor, which makes a noticeable difference in certain lighting conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "To top it off, there’s an incredibly fast ultrasonic fingerprint reader underneath. If I had to nitpick, I’d wish the touch target was a bit larger, but that’s about it. Honestly, if display quality is crucial to you, this is the phone to get.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, what if battery life is your primary concern? While you could consider an Energizer phone, this device features a 5,000mAh battery and remains one of the best-performing phones in that regard over the past two years. It manages to stay thinner while still accommodating the S Pen. The device supports 45-watt wired charging and 25-watt wireless charging. I experienced long usage days with over six hours of screen time, and I even managed to stretch it to two full days with 1440p at 120Hz and high brightness. So really, why look elsewhere?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if performance is what you care about most, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is making its way into many phones, and it looks fantastic. The S24 Ultra pairs this with 12GB of RAM, excelling in multitasking. If you’re interested in using a stylus, the S Pen is the only high-end stylus available in slab smartphones, making it an excellent tool for note-taking, drawing, and highlighting. If stylus use isn’t your thing, you can still enjoy stellar everyday and gaming performance, as it features newly added ray tracing and a 90% larger vapor chamber for extended cooling.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could opt for a gaming phone to squeeze out more frames from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 with advanced cooling systems, but that would require accepting sacrifices typical of gaming phones. Whether you need those extra frames is subjective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding cameras, there are plenty of great options out there for your $1,300. The Pixel just won a blind camera test, and Sony offers the best manual mode. However, when evaluating smartphone cameras, there are two approaches: the utility of specs and the subjective aesthetics. Utility-wise, this camera setup checks every box. It features four cameras on the back, mainly building on last year’s S23 Ultra. The primary camera remains a remarkable 200-megapixel sensor, delivering consistent, versatile performance with great dynamic range and quick autofocus, and it typically outputs 12-megapixel photos unless exceptional lighting is present.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ultra-wide camera has some distortion at the edges but is wider than the primary, making it fun to shoot with. Just be sure to turn off the auto macro mode, as it tends to produce poor-quality images. The S24 Ultra also introduces a new 50-megapixel 5X telephoto camera, enhancing resolution and image quality in that zoom range, while still allowing for 10X zoom and ultra-stable shots of distant objects, like the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of utility, this camera system does everything you'd want, but there's also a subjective aspect to consider. Samsung’s processing style tends to be slightly more vibrant and contrasty than competitors'. If you want to check every feature box without compromise, this phone does just that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the S24 Ultra captures images in HDR format by default, similar to what the Pixel and iPhone do. It ensures that specular highlights and dynamic range differences are well-managed across capturing, viewing, and sharing, especially supported by a partnership with platforms like Instagram and Snapchat.\n",
      "\n",
      "If software features are paramount, this phone now incorporates numerous helpful AI functionalities that enhance everyday use. Many of these features have been developed in partnership with Google, which is interesting—Samsung needs Google to maintain competitiveness, especially against the iPhone, while Google benefits from this collaboration as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you open a photo in Samsung’s Gallery app, you can access various AI-driven enhancements, like remastering, erasing reflections, and even applying background blur to non-portrait images based on detected subjects. There’s also a separate Magic Editor that allows for extensive editing, such as moving subjects or removing unwanted items from photos without cropping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AI features are organized under \"Advanced Intelligence,\" which includes functions like live call translation, improved voice recording capabilities, and webpage summaries. One particularly impressive feature is Circle to Search, allowing you to quickly search anything on your screen by simply circling it, resulting in rapid responses without leaving your current app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Samsung now promises seven years of security updates and seven generations of major software updates for this phone line, effectively ensuring the S24 Ultra remains relevant through 2031.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, if you wanted longevity in software updates or the best features, it meant going for an iPhone or Pixel. However, with these new offerings, choosing the S24 Ultra becomes a compelling option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at how the S24 Ultra compares with the iPhone, Samsung is clearly pulling elements from Apple’s design, from the new titanium colors to the flatter screens and boxier corners. They've also added an always-on display that shows your wallpaper, reminiscent of Apple's design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite being a $1,300 phone, if you want everything stuffed into one device, this is the one to get. It delivers reliability, speed, and a comprehensive feature set.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the way, this video is sponsored by Ridge. The Ridge Wallet is a minimalist, modern wallet with a patented dual-track design, accommodating up to 12 cards while remaining slim.

      "So there are two types of people in this world: those who find AirPods comfortable and those who don’t. There are people who love silicon-tipped in-earbuds and those who hate them. There are also those who really need noise cancellation and those who don’t care about it. But Apple wants to cater to both types of customers, which is why there are two versions of the new AirPods this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a bit confusing how they announced it at the keynote, but essentially, you have the base AirPods 4 for $129, and for $179, you can get the AirPods 4 with noise cancellation. However, that’s not the only difference between them. After testing them for a few days, I can share the verdict on their differences and whether they're worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with the AirPods themselves. They’ve slightly tweaked the shape, giving these buds new curves and angles, allowing the driver to point more directly into your ear with fewer reflections. The stem is a bit shorter, but overall, they still look and feel like AirPods—very familiar. They have IP54 dust and water resistance, up from IPX4 last year. They still have in-ear detection and microphones all around. My biggest question, however, was whether this new shape fits better in my ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I haven't had any luck with hard-tipped AirPods since their inception. The latest version was the closest I’ve come to a good fit, but even then, they would fall out after about 10 seconds of jogging. So, do the 4s fit better for me? Slightly, but not enough to make a huge difference. When I tried to get them seated properly, I still felt them slowly coming out, even while just sitting still. If you struggled with previous AirPods, you might still have issues with these, but if the original AirPods fit you, then these should fit just fine too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything I’ve mentioned thus far applies to both the base AirPods and the active noise-canceling version. They share the same size and shape; you can’t distinguish between them just by looking at the buds. Where the differences begin is with the new case. The case is a bit smaller and now features USB Type-C, which is a welcome change. However, the base version’s case is simply that: a case with USB-C.\n",
      "\n",
      "The noise-canceling version's case has a small speaker at the bottom, allowing it to chime when charging and make a noise when it’s lost. It also supports wireless charging on the back, which is super convenient. One downside, though, is that the new case doesn’t have MagSafe anymore, likely because it’s just slightly too small. The previous generation's case would align perfectly with MagSafe chargers, providing a seamless charging experience. This year's case, however, doesn’t stick to the charger, which is a bit disappointing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this, I noticed the magnets holding the AirPods in place feel more secure than before. This case also works with Apple Watch puck chargers, but it’s not your regular charger; it exclusively charges Apple Watches and AirPods. Interestingly, the traditional pairing button found on the back of AirPods 3 has been replaced with a hidden capacitive touch area just beneath the pairing light on the front. A double tap activates pairing mode, while a triple tap initiates a factory reset—an innovative change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the pressing question many are likely asking: how good is the Active Noise Cancellation in these new AirPods? Should you consider getting it without opting for the AirPods Pro? My reference point will be the AirPods Pro 2. While these new earbuds are impressive, they're definitely not as effective as the Pros due to the physical differences. The hard tips don't create a perfect seal in my ear, leaving some air gaps that allow sound in from the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Active Noise Cancellation works reasonably well at lowering background noise, so you can hear your audio better, though it doesn’t eliminate noise completely. If I had to rate noise cancellation effectiveness, I'd say the AirPods Pro are around an 8 out of 10, while these new hard-tipped AirPods are closer to a 4 or 5. They're more about noise reduction than complete cancellation, making them useful in louder environments, like on a train or airplane, but not as effective in quieter settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Importantly, every pair of headphones with noise cancellation should feature a transparency mode, and these do as well. This may very well be the best transparency mode I’ve experienced on any AirPods. It sounds natural because some outside noise naturally seeps in, enhancing the overall effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery life does take a slight hit with Active Noise Cancellation—rated for four hours—but it offers a total of 20 hours when used with the case. These new AirPods now join the AirPods Pro as the only headphones with ultra-low latency support for Vision Pro, courtesy of the H2 chip. The built-in speaker is handy for locating the case if it's buried in a bag or under something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, during the Apple keynote, a refresh for AirPods Max was mentioned alongside these new models. But I use the term \"refresh\" lightly because the only updates were switching to USB Type-C and offering new colors—no material changes or sound quality improvements. This lack of updates is quite ridiculous, and I won’t be reviewing those headphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the H2 chip, it primarily handles all processing, especially from the microphones, improving background noise reduction during calls, enhancing Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency mode, and Adaptive Audio. It even allows you to nod or shake your head to interact with Siri. For instance, you can nod to answer a call or shake your head to decline a text response—this feature works remarkably well.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it’s a matter of principle that $550 over-ear noise-canceling headphones shouldn't lack the latest technology. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of sound quality, the new AirPods are solid. The AirPods 3 made a respectable improvement, and while there’s no EQ customization, they perform decently across various applications. These AirPods excel in making phone calls and podcasts sound great while maintaining a good balance for music and movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the prices are $129 for the base AirPods and $179 for the version with Active Noise Cancellation. Now you know the differences, the capabilities, and how well they perform, allowing you to decide what suits you best. Personally, I still prefer silicon ear tips for a more secure fit, which significantly enhances noise cancellation. I’m leaning towards AirPods Pro, especially since they’re available for around $199 on Amazon—only $20 more than the new models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, many will happily save that $20 and opt for the hard-tipped AirPods. It’s worth noting that they might not excel in specific categories compared to other earbuds, like fit for exercise, battery life, or sound quality. However, they are still AirPods, which means they offer seamless integration within the Apple ecosystem and a balanced frequency response across various uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re considering a new pair of AirPods but dislike the typical design, check out our channel sponsor dbrand, which offers the new Area 51 case. This isn't just any regular design; it features a unique topographical pattern with a remarkable 3D-printed texture you can actually feel. The 3D ink is durable, adding an extra layer of grip that’s hard to describe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, dbrand crafted this design using an actual topographical map of Area 51—naturally! The Area 51 skins come in red, yellow, and black. I usually prefer matte black, but this nice yellow looks pretty slick.\n",
      "\n",
      "These new Area 51 skins are available for an array of devices, so I’ll leave a link in the description for anyone interested in picking one up for themselves.\n",
      "\n",

      "- One of the best gaming phones on the planet is going mainstream. Just look at all the previous ROG Phones: ROG Phone 1, ROG Phone 2, ROG Phone 3... They skipped 4 because it’s considered bad luck. Then we had ROG Phone 5, ROG Phone 6, and ROG Phone 7. Now we have the ROG Phone 8 Pro, which is noticeably more regular.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASUS still makes other standard phones, like the Zenfone, and ROG still stands for Republic of Gamers. This is definitely still a gaming phone. However, the features that make gaming phones excellent for gaming also enhance their performance for media and make them great all-around daily drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASUS has finally said, \"What if we just package our great gaming phone for the masses?\" I believe this is the first time they’ve really committed to that idea. \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't get me wrong; they still include the gamer features. There's a hidden display on the back of the phone and all kinds of impressive specs, but the pivot is real. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given that it’s still a gaming phone, it's no surprise that it boasts top-tier specifications. The ROG Phone 8 Pro features a 6.78-inch 165 Hz AMOLED display with an astonishing brightness of 2,500 nits. It’s powered by a 3.3 GHz Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, with up to 24 GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1 TB of UFS 4.0 fast storage. It shatters Geekbench scores and crushes 3DMark benchmarks, and it can run \"Genshin Impact\" at 60 FPS. This phone is incredibly fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Navigating through apps and using it as a regular phone is just as impressive. It's one of the snappiest phones I’ve ever used. Taking photos is extremely quick, responding within milliseconds when you touch the shutter button. Even the optical fingerprint reader under the glass is surprisingly fast. Overall, it’s the fastest, most reactive phone I’ve ever used.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it excels in gaming, ASUS must now repackage this as a great daily driver. Let’s face it, previous gaming phones felt overly gamery. \n",
      "\n",
      "First things first: it needs to be more user-friendly for one-handed use. Gamers may often hold their phones sideways, but regular phone tasks are performed vertically with one hand. So, they’ve minimized the bezels all around, which is noticeable, especially at the top and bottom. The design now aligns with other full-screen flagships on the market. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time in an ROG Phone, there’s a hole-punch camera, and it's quite small, giving it a normal look. This change comes at the expense of some front-facing speaker space. Although the speakers remain loud and capable of providing a rich stereo sound, they are slightly less powerful than those of last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASUS has also made the phone thinner. They’ve flattened the frame on the sides, creating a slightly more streamlined device, now under 9 millimeters for the first time. Despite the camera bump, it’s still well-balanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, a thinner design comes with a minor trade-off: the battery size has decreased from 6,000 mAh to 5,500 mAh in this ROG Phone. However, I haven’t really noticed a difference in usage, as it still performs remarkably well with the software optimizations and this display. \n",
      "\n",
      "The result of all that design trimming is a phone that is still sizable but much closer to a normal phone dimensions. It's basically the same size as my Pixel 8 Pro, which I've been using daily, yet it still includes the gaming and media-friendly features you’d expect. \n",
      "\n",
      "There’s still a second USB-C port on the side for charging while gaming in landscape mode, and it retains the remappable shoulder triggers and the rare headphone jack. On a side note, I’ve been testing some in-ear monitors lately, and this is one of the few phones that I can plug into and use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASUS includes a surprising number of audio adjustment features along with various EQ settings that make a significant difference. Additionally, if you’re using this daily, people will want reassurance of water resistance. Previous gaming phones didn’t focus much on this aspect. While the ROG Phone 7 had an IP54 rating, which is good, this is the first ROG Phone that achieves full IP68 water and dust resistance—meaning it can withstand being rained on, accidentally having a drink spilled on it, or even being dropped in a toilet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, does it still look like a gaming phone? Honestly, I believe they’ve struck a good balance. Over the years, they’ve gradually toned down the appearance, reducing the RGB lighting and jagged lines on the back. I think the camera bump is the oddest feature, but aside from that, the design is fairly subtle. It features a satin black finish that doesn’t show fingerprints, with a single glossy diagonal strip that suggests a “gamer” aesthetic, but in a subdued manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could do without the text—like the “Republic of Gamers” branding or the “Good luck, have fun” message next to the USB-C port—but overall, it’s a nice, toned-down design. \n",
      "\n",
      "But what if I told you there’s still a display on the back? They couldn’t resist! When the screen is off, it’s nearly invisible. If you open the Armoury Crate and enable AniMe Vision—and I'm not sure why it's called that—the display lights up. It’s an all-white LED dot matrix display that can showcase everything from logos to charging status to incoming call notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even while taking a photo, it performs a countdown timer on the outside screen. When gaming, it can show that you’re playing a game. While this feature is somewhat gimmicky, I appreciate it for a couple of reasons: it remains minimal on the back of the phone and provides useful information. You can customize it for different scenarios, and when the screen is off, you wouldn't even notice it was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, they've included wireless charging in an ROG Phone for the first time. Previous models had so much going on with screens and lights on the back that there was no room for wireless charging, which was acceptable as gamers weren’t initially interested. However, they’ve now made space for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should mention that the coil is positioned slightly higher than normal, above the display. As a result, it doesn’t align with vertical wireless chargers, but if you place the phone sideways, it charges without issue. Many people don't rely on wireless charging, but it appears to be a necessary feature for high-end versatile flagship phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you don’t use that feature, there’s still 65-watt wired charging with the charger included in the box. \n",
      "\n",
      "In previous reviews, I would often say, \"The camera is pretty bad, but this is a gaming phone. That's not why you’re buying it.\" With the ROG Phone 8 Pro, the camera has transitioned from an afterthought to one of the most important aspects of a mainstream phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how did ASUS fare in this department? The ROG Phone features an all-new camera system with a 50-megapixel primary camera, a 3x telephoto for the first time, and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide. While it's more capable than before, it seems to lag behind the Zenfone 10, which is also made by ASUS. Are the different branches of the company even communicating? (laughs)\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary camera sensor is the IMX890, similar to the one in the OnePlus 11, the Nothing Phone 2, and others in the $600-$700 range. It produces decent images in good lighting but tends to suffer from motion blur and aggressive HDR adjustments. With subjects like people, the faces sometimes look overexposed while the background gets underexposed. It’s evident that the processing is quite aggressive, almost as if it’s using algorithms meant for older sensors.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the upside, it offers super steady video thanks to a hybrid six-axis gimbal, which enhances handheld shooting in lower light conditions and results in smooth video capture. The front-facing camera is wider angle, allowing more people to fit into the frame, even if it still leans towards HDR over-processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The telephoto lens, new in this model, provides genuine utility. For those who do a lot of zooming, 3x may not be the most extensive zoom available, but the stabilization is solid, allowing for effective digital zooming.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the camera has advanced but remains a secondary focus for this phone. While it could meet the needs of a $600-$700 phone, it’s worth noting that the ROG Phone starts at $1,100 and this Pro version, with 24 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage, is priced at $1,500.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, you’ll start noticing AI features in nearly every phone powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. This is one of the first devices showcasing these capabilities. Qualcomm has integrated new AI functionalities into this chip, and manufacturers are likely to utilize them extensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the ROG Phone, these features include pattern recognition in games that fast-tracks through recognized scenes in supported titles, as well as the ability to identify on-screen elements and direct you to relevant walkthroughs for the game you’re playing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve found other features, like the improved setting search, to be quite practical. The system has semantic understanding, enabling it to locate settings based on descriptions you provide. Even if you type something like “Two of one,” it recognizes that you’re referring to the Twin Apps feature that allows multiple accounts for a single app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, AI capabilities will be a significant theme for phones in 2024, and you can take my word for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "To wrap up, the ROG Phone 8 Pro remains a powerful, fast Android phone, but it features a refined aesthetic that sacrifices some gamery elements for broader appeal. Many of the design decisions seem intelligent, like implementing thinner bezels and a more streamlined form factor, even with a slightly smaller battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, ASUS couldn’t overcome the challenges of the camera system. While it's good, it falls short of expectations for a mainstream phone, which remains a crucial aspect. Thus, this phone excels as a solid gaming device.\n",

      "- All right, so you've seen the unboxing. Now it's time for the breakdown. What is using the Apple Vision Pro actually like? This is easily one of Apple's craziest, most radical, possibly dystopian products of all time. I have a lot of thoughts since I've been using it for about a week now. There are some parts of this headset that are absolutely incredible, and some other parts that feel weird or borderline unfinished.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are all kinds of new technologies, from a new operating system to infrared eye tracking to virtually reconstructed versions of you. There are so many new things to understand that provide a clearer sense of what this headset actually is and what it does. So I'm going to break this down into two parts. This video focuses on using the Vision Pro. It's everything I've learned from a week of wearing and getting used to this device every single day. However, I'm also working on a wider-ranging review video.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with the hardware fundamentals. What is this device that I’m holding? At its core, the Apple Vision Pro is a VR headset. Apple will never say that, and they probably won’t like that I’m using the word “VR.” I made an entire video on why they refuse to embrace that terminology, instead referring to it as spatial computing. But the truth is, it's a really high-end virtual reality headset. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s something we’ve seen before, with displays, lenses, speakers, fans, and buttons. But before I even turn this thing on, there are several things that set it apart. First of all, it’s made of metal. There’s a lot of metal and glass here, both high-quality but relatively heavy materials. The precisely machined aluminum frame surrounds the outside, and yes, those are intakes for the fans at the bottom, with vents for those fans at the top. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the right side, there's a digital crown that can be pressed in or turned, and on the left side is a single larger button, which are essentially the same two buttons as on an Apple Watch. Further back on the band, there are small pods with downward-facing grills—those are speakers directed straight at your ears and they work surprisingly well. However, this also means people around you can hear a bit of what you're hearing. There’s a bit of bleed, and I have a lot to say about spatial audio, so stick around for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main feature is at the front: a large piece of glass that is very easy to fingerprint and smudge. Behind that is an outward-facing OLED display and a bunch of sensors all around: forward-facing sensors, sideways, and straight down. There are depth sensors, infrared illuminators, lidar scanners, and regular RGB cameras, all processed by an M2 chip and an R1 chip inside this thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the craziest part is that inside the headset, there are even more sensors tracking your eyes in real-time, which enables eye control and displays a representation of your eyes on the outside of the headset. It's complicated, but overall, when you put it all together, you get a very well-made, high-end, but also somewhat heavy computer to wear on your face.\n",

      "Officially, this headset with this solo knit band weighs 638 grams, which, as some pointed out on Twitter, is slightly less than the plastic Meta Quest Pro. However, the Quest Pro has a lot of battery weight on the back of your head to serve as a counterbalance, so the weight distribution is quite different. The Quest Pro is also not particularly comfortable. \n",
      "\n",
      "The key here is that Apple decided to remove the battery from the headset. While this means there’s nothing on the back of your head to rest against, allowing for more comfortable wear, it also results in a front-heavy design. All the weight is resting on the front of your face and you have to deal with a cable running up to your head.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the unboxing, you saw the battery, which is a surprisingly small 3,366 milliamp-hours. I say surprisingly small because a typical battery bank of this size would usually be 10,000, 15,000, or even 20,000 milliamp-hours. I suspect there’s a lot of heat insulation going on here. The battery comes with a non-removable four-foot cable and a proprietary connector that twists and locks to the headset, ensuring a solid connection. It starts glowing when connected and takes just under a minute to boot up, displaying a little Apple logo on the outside screen. \n",
      "\n",
      "There’s no on-or-off button. Similar to AirPods Max, if you take the headset off, it’ll enter standby mode after some time, but it won’t turn off. To completely turn it off, you have to twist and unplug the cable. The battery life is not ideal, ranging from two to four hours, which is similar to the battery life of many other VR headsets. If you want to use it for longer, you can plug it into a USB-C port on the battery for unlimited battery life or daisy chain another battery on the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no controllers that come with this headset. It supports other input methods like game controllers, a mouse, and a keyboard, but the primary input method for Vision Pro users is your eyes and hands. The first time you wear the headset, it goes through a calibration process which is pretty interesting. It adjusts the distance between the lenses, then scans your hands to understand them before you look at a bunch of dots around the screen and pinch your fingers to select them. \n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll notice that you can position your hands almost anywhere within view of the headset. The sensors are wide-angled, so you don't have to keep your hands precisely in front of you to interact. You control things in a 180-degree bubble in front of you with your pinching motion. When you hit the digital crown, the app drawer appears. \n",
      "\n",
      "The standout feature of this headset is the incredible spatial positioning lock. Imagine a wall or window appearing locked in place in 3D space in your room. When you move your head or body, it stays exactly where it’s supposed to be. Upon entering Apple’s new Vision OS, I would describe it as similar to iPad OS but with a glassy look and the added dimension of 3D space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitting the digital crown brings the app drawer back up. You simply look at the icon you want and pinch your fingers together to select it and open the app. Scrolling is intuitive; you pinch and pull in the air as if things are on a string. The experience is responsive and fluid. The biggest adjustment is that you can only control what you’re looking at directly, which takes some getting used to since most computers allow for more flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you open a Vision OS app, it locks into place, appearing as a frosted glass UI that lets you see some color behind it, casting shadows in the right 3D space. At the bottom of the window, there’s a bar to pinch and drag around, allowing you to move the window in any direction or resize it. By default, passthrough is always on, meaning you can see the real world around you through the cameras while using the headset.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where Apple seeks to normalize the term spatial computing. It feels similar to augmented reality, as you can always see your surroundings, but technically it's not AR, since you are looking at a reconstructed view through a camera feed. This passthrough feature is the best I’ve seen in any VR headset, allowing for real-time engagement with your environment. The R1 chip processes everything while maintaining low latency.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to fully immerse yourself, just rotate the digital crown clockwise. You can dial the environment surrounding you up until it's fully encompassing. Apple includes several relaxing digital environments, and while none are photorealistic, they are the most realistic digital environments I’ve seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a couple of quirks in the UI regarding the control center and text input. To access the control center, you need to look up and turn your head to see an arrow above you. For text input, you can either poke at keys on a virtual keyboard, look at keys and pinch to select them, or use voice commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you know what the Vision Pro is and how it operates, what can you do with it? What is the killer app? The Vision Pro supports two types of apps: those built specifically for it and those that are simply iPhone and iPad apps compatible because the developer didn’t opt out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's stock apps are designed to utilize the Vision Pro’s capabilities fully. For example, the Apple Music app maintains its usual functionality but is presented in this frosted-glass UI. Other apps, such as Photos, allow for panoramic views with a parallax effect, creating an immersive experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are third-party apps designed ahead of time too, like Sky Guide, which lets you explore constellations in an immersive way, and Jig Space, which allows you to manipulate 3D models in your environment. Another interesting app is Keynote, which helps you practice presentations in an immersive environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, none of these apps are quite a \"killer app.\" Many non-native but technically compatible apps are simply iPhone or iPad apps that have not been optimized for the Vision Pro yet. Some notable exceptions include no Netflix, YouTube, or Spotify apps. While you can access these through a browser, you'll miss many features of dedicated apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the killer app of the Vision Pro isn't a singular app, but rather the ecosystem it creates. When you log in with your Apple ID, all your services, messages, photos, and Notes are easily accessible. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favorite features is connecting to your Mac. You can transform your Mac’s display into a 4K window inside the headset and use it just like a regular computer while opening Vision Pro apps around it. The setup flexibility feels particularly futuristic, especially useful when working on a plane.\n",
      "\n",
      "One limitation is the single monitor from your Mac—you can’t use dual displays. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s talk about Personas, a unique feature of this headset. The outward display of eyes is a key characteristic. It’s not actually see-through, as it’s a digital representation created by internal sensors that track your eyes. This design allows the headset to provide a more human-like interaction with those around you.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can register your Persona through a dedicated process that captures facial expressions and features, and you can use this Persona for features like FaceTime. The experience is amazing; when on a FaceTime call, the virtual windows for conversations appear glassy and immersive, making the interaction feel more real.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while the Vision Pro has phenomenal features, there's still more to consider regarding price, use cases, and its current app ecosystem. The full review will dive deeper into all these angles, but I’ll leave you with my current takeaways from a week of usage: \n",
      "\n",
      "**Upsides:** immersion, spatial positioning, eye tracking, hand control, passthrough quality, the ecosystem, and spatial audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Downsides:** weight and comfort, exterior eye display, app selection, short battery life, and high price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stay tuned for the full review, and thanks for watching! Catch you later. Peace.\n",

      "\n",
      "I've talked and made jokes in the past, mostly claiming that Google Assistant is clearly the best virtual assistant, with Bixby, Siri, and Alexa trailing behind at various levels. However, the last time I conducted this type of test was in 2017. So, I figured we should revisit this, retest things, and see if Google Assistant still holds the title of the best virtual assistant on a smartphone today.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to give a shoutout to Clippy, the original virtual assistant, whose ugly Christmas sweater from Microsoft inspired this one, the MKBHD 8-bit Drip, available while supplies last at shop.mkbhd.com. They're very limited, so check it out via the link below.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, I focused on the simple questions—three things you often ask a virtual assistant: the weather, timers, and facts. All the assistants performed adequately with weather inquiries, which is probably the number one query for me. They also answered standard facts fairly quickly, although there was a discrepancy regarding the height of one person. However, when it came to timers, for some strange reason, Siri cannot manage multiple timers simultaneously on the iPhone. If you have one timer running and ask for a second, it always asks if you want to replace the first timer. This seems like a basic issue Apple should have resolved by now, especially since you can set multiple timers on Siri when using a HomePod mini.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to bore you with a sequence of back-to-back questions and answers, as I admit it was somewhat dull during testing. Instead, I’ll share some examples and highlights of my findings regarding how these assistants respond during interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all the latest software updates across the assistants and all asked the same questions while on the same WiFi connections, the fastest responders were generally Google Assistant or Siri. However, Siri and Bixby experienced more instances of lag and didn’t always respond promptly, almost as if they were experiencing a poor internet connection—even when they weren't. A simple restart helped with Bixby, while Siri seemed to lag randomly, the reason for which I haven't identified yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "When posed with straightforward fact questions, there was no clear winner, which I actually found reassuring. Questions that are easily searchable, like \"How tall is the Taj Mahal?\" or \"What do whales eat?\" prompted responses from all assistants that were mostly consistent. Siri tends to rely heavily on Wikipedia for its answers and usually provides a web search link when it goes beyond Wikipedia, saying, “Look what I Googled for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Google Assistant is more likely to provide a visual and slightly extra information beyond what you asked. Since Bixby is powered by Google, it often reads what Google Assistant says word for word. Alexa is more inclined to throw in some additional information, like your latest Amazon order or something random.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to device control, there is a clear winner—actually, two: Google Assistant and Bixby. For basic tasks, all are capable. For instance, they can adjust screen brightness, open the camera, or launch apps with voice commands. Setting an alarm is simple; if you ask to open the app store, all will direct you to their respective stores. Notably, Bixby opens the Samsung Galaxy Store, which is a nice touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when tasks become more complex, Google Assistant and Bixby outshine the others. For example, when I asked to take a selfie, Siri and Alexa simply opened the camera, while Bixby and Google actually opened the camera, switched to the selfie mode, set a timer, and snapped the picture. Similarly, when asked to play \"Squid Game\" on Netflix, both Google and Bixby would open the app, locate the first unseen episode, and start playing it, whereas Siri just opened the app, and Alexa got lost in the process. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I asked Siri to initiate a voice recording or memo, again, Google and Bixby would open the recording app and start recording, while Siri just opened the app, and Alexa remained unresponsive. These voice commands were faster than I could have done it manually. Additionally, Bixby offers other device-specific features that may save you a lot of time with frequently used apps. It was strong in this area during my last assessment, while Alexa continues to lag in device control since it's not integrated within its own smartphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s discuss conversational abilities. For example, when I asked, \"Who is the coach of the Phoenix Suns?\" the follow-up questions flowed naturally. Siri struggled to maintain the conversation after about four sequential questions, while Google Assistant excelled in remembering the context and maintaining the discussion over numerous questions in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversational examples included inquiries about the Taj Mahal—where it is, its height, what it’s made of—and then smoothly transitioning into questions about the Weeknd, such as his birthday, latest album, and real name. Google Assistant is the best choice if you're looking to ask a series of related questions or want to research a topic thoroughly through voice commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to searching for pictures, all assistants can search the web, except Bixby, which didn’t. Alexa, oddly, searched for an Amazon Photos app. However, when I asked Google to show my pictures of dogs, it successfully opened and searched within my own Photos album for my images of dogs. \n",
      "\n",
      "I conducted several tests with varying styles of questions and followed up on them, which led me to a solid conclusion. If you're wondering which assistant came out on top, the most significant takeaway from all this testing is that Alexa is clearly the weakest, lagging far behind the others as a smartphone assistant. This holds especially true unless you're already deeply embedded in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem, where everything might work seamlessly in your smart home.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, this debate touches on ecosystem integration, as the effectiveness of these assistants often hinges on how well they fit within their respective smart home environments. For example, if you’re committed to HomeKit, Siri becomes your go-to for managing cameras and doorbells while controlling lights. On the other hand, those deeply invested in Google Home have the same experience with Google Assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The upcoming Next Gen Matter standard may change this dynamic, potentially making this section irrelevant. If you're interested in a video specifically about that, be sure to comment or leave a thumbs up. For now, considering the isolated ecosystems, they matter greatly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my experiences, across every smartphone, whether it's an iPhone or Android, Google Assistant remains the most useful overall. This advantage is amplified if you have a Pixel phone, which offers features like call screening and Hold for Me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, Google Assistant is faster, provides well-sourced answers, and excels at conversational context. It also supports many third-party integrations and apps. I built my smart home around Google Home, making it exceptionally effective for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the second-best, I considered placing Bixby here—relevant primarily for Samsung phone users—but I ultimately decided on Siri due to its integration with Apple’s ecosystem. It works well if you’re involved with HomeKit and has support for smart speakers, though still lacking the capability for multiple timers on phones. Siri also supports routines, which can combine several commands into one action, but navigating the Siri shortcuts interface can be complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "This puts Bixby in third place, while Alexa is simply ineffective on smartphones. A few years ago, an HTC phone featured both Google Assistant and Alexa side by side, and it worked reasonably well, but since then, Alexa has fallen far behind. If you are new to using voice assistants or setting up a smart home, I recommend avoiding Alexa-exclusive products for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know in the comments if you agree that Google Assistant still stands out as the leader, or if there are any specific features you find especially useful in a virtual assistant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, a word from our channel sponsor, Dbrand: they are relaunching the Damascus skin due to popular demand. It features a reflective holographic design, and you can customize it for any device. Plus, you get a free Triple Black skin with your order! I’ll link it below.\n",

      "So, this is my Titanium iPhone 15 Pro that I've been using without a case for 88 days, or about three months now. I want to provide longer-term reviews; while three months isn't a super long time in the grand scheme of smartphones, it's certainly longer than the usual one to two-week review period where I summarize everything from my experience. The longer I use a phone, the more I uncover about it—especially regarding how I personally use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I consistently carry two phones, and the iPhone typically stays in my pocket for an extended period. Therefore, I have a lot more experiences to share about this iPhone. First off, I haven't put my phone in a case since the day I bought it. Sometimes I regret this decision, but occasionally, I don't. I rarely drop my phone, and so far, this one hasn't been dropped either. It does show some regular signs of wear and tear, which aren't too concerning. I do tend to get some larger scratches on the front display glass because I opted not to use a screen protector. However, these scratches are no more than usual despite the fancy ceramic shield.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate the switch to titanium for the frame and the side rails of this phone; it looks significantly better than the stainless steel. It's also lighter, and I’m glad I chose this lighter color because it shows the fewest fingerprints and looks the cleanest. Overall, I'm happy with my specifications choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, regarding long-term behavior, there are three interesting points about this phone. Two features I’m using much less than expected, and one I'm using almost exactly as much as I thought I would. First, the camera on the Pro iPhone introduces a neat multiple focal lengths feature. You can tap the 1x button three times to access 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths, all with the same quality. However, I hardly use this feature. I generally frame things at 1x, and that’s the extent of it for me. Despite testing showing that it works, I think that the new crop button added in iOS 17, which appears when you zoom in on a photo, is significantly more useful—particularly for me and likely for others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's the action button, which is a significant feature of this year's Pro iPhones, allowing some customization on your device. The user interface Apple created in the settings for this feature feels somewhat un-Apple-like. It works well, and you can map the button to nearly anything you want. However, there was a notable observation made by many about its placement: the old mute switch was conveniently tucked away, making it easy to leave your phone on mute indefinitely. Apple decided to place this action button in the same spot as the old mute switch, which makes it a bit tricky to reach, especially when using the phone with one hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first got the phone, I was excited about the potential uses for the action button. Initially, I mapped it to Google Assistant since I rarely use Siri. Later, I briefly changed it to start a voice conversation with ChatGPT. While it's cool to have that feature, it isn’t particularly useful because it lacks access to current events, your calendar, or the weather. So, that didn’t last long. I then switched it to open a new task in my preferred to-do list app, TickTick. While this was handy, I already had the muscle memory to open the app manually, making it somewhat redundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, I settled on programming the action button to open the camera, which is the fastest way for me to access it. While there’s also a lock screen shortcut, it's often quicker for me to just hit the button and take a photo if something is happening that I don't want to miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, USB Type-C is another standout feature of this generation of iPhones. The base iPhone 15 has slow USB 2.0 speeds, but the 15 Pro and Pro Max support USB 3.2 speeds, which significantly facilitates importing large files, like ProRes footage. Thank you, Europe, for influencing this change! As someone who typically uses a wireless charger, I appreciate having just one cable for charging my iPhone, Android phone, iPad Pro, and laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I can’t entirely eliminate my lightning cables yet, as some devices in my Apple ecosystem, like the AirPods Max, still require one. I'm also stuck carrying the lightning cable for my Magic Keyboard and Apple Magic Trackpad. I’m unsure how long it will take Apple to upgrade all these devices to USB Type-C, but I guess my lightning cables will be around for a bit longer. Rumors suggest a refresh for the AirPods Max since they launched in late 2020, but there’s no official word yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been several software updates to the iPhone 15 since its launch on iOS 17, and we've already made it to iOS 17.2. The new Journal app is live now, which some friends use, though I don’t. There have been numerous bug fixes and optimizations, addressing previously reported issues, including with the Instagram app and overheating problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also a new toggle in the camera app settings for recording spatial video for the Apple Vision Pro. This indicates some interesting alignment for the Vision Pro's launch, possibly in January or February. If you recall the demo for spatial videos on the Vision Pro, you can record them using an iPhone, specifically the 15 or 15 Pro, thanks to the horizontal arrangement of the main and ultra-wide cameras. \n",
      "\n",
      "When activated in the camera app, you can shoot spatial video, which requires holding the iPhone in landscape mode since your eyes are side by side. However, it only captures at 1080p 30fps as it processes two streams of video simultaneously—one from the main camera and the other from the ultra-wide camera for depth. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can go ahead and shoot spatial videos, but if you watch them back on the phone, they will appear as standard videos. To truly appreciate the spatial aspect of the recordings, you'll need an Apple Vision Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had the chance to experience the Vision Pro several times since my initial preview. I've recorded some spatial videos and watched them on the headset. I found that they look decent, especially when the subject is within two to four feet of the camera—creating a 3D-like effect. So, if you're recording spatial videos, keeping your subject within that range is ideal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, here's a tip: if anything is happening on the Dynamic Island and it's getting in the way, you can swipe across it to hide or change its view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, you don't need to upgrade your phone every year or even every couple of years. Still, after using the iPhone 15 Pro, I feel confident asserting that this is one of the better years to upgrade, given the updated cameras, USB Type-C, and titanium build. There's a concept known as an upgrade sweet spot, and this phone hits it, especially for those with much older iPhones.\n",
      "\n",
      "To wrap up, in my original iPhone 15 Pro review, I compared it to the Porsche 911 in that its design doesn't change much from generation to generation. Instead, they refine and improve the existing design slowly. I recently turned 30, and for my birthday, I took the plunge into a matte black version. Living with a 911 has helped me appreciate that strategy even more. It’s not flashy or dramatic; it's consistent, familiar, and confidence-inspiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, every shot in this video was captured on an iPhone 15 Pro. Thanks for watching. I'll catch you guys in the next one. Peace!\n",

      "- Hey, what's up, MKBHD here. I've got the latest beta of Android 15 on my Pixel 8 Pro right here. As many of you know, I've been doing these videos for a long time. I’ve made videos on the best features of the latest version of Android for I don't know how many years now, even back when they were naming them after desserts. If you’ve been watching all of these, you may have noticed a trend. In the past, there used to be huge new features, massive visual overhauls, and all sorts of dramatic changes with Android. But now things have stabilized, I would say. It’s much more about small changes and nuanced improvements here and there. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s reached a point where these top five features of Android 15 would have previously been part of a .0.2 update. The new features feel smaller with each new version. However, that also means they are a bit more refined; they focus more on usefulness and little tweaks that enhance the overall experience of using and owning your phone. I can appreciate that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will also note that in videos past, I've mentioned versions that were initially exclusive to the Pixel line, implying that you may never get to experience the latest Android updates. But I feel like with many new companies promising a good amount of future software updates, hopefully, more people will actually see some of these improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I'm going to jump right in. Here are the top five best features I’ve found in Android 15. \n",
      "\n",
      "Number five is called Private Space, and it's exactly what it sounds like. It’s a private area on your Android phone for your top-secret files, photos, and anything else you want to keep hidden. To turn it on, go to Settings, then Security & Privacy, and you'll find Private Space near the bottom. After confirming your identity, you can choose a Google account and set a new lock if you want. Once set up, you can always find it at the bottom of your app drawer.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you give someone your phone to borrow, you could put it in Guest Mode for a brand-new setup for them, but Private Space is different. It’s a separate section with its own lock beneath your existing account, specifically for your confidential activities, apps, files, and photos. When you want to hide it away again, just hit Lock. You can put whatever you want in there—totally up to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number four combines several little enhancements that stack up to create a more refined experience. One of these is rich widget previews. While this might not seem huge because you don't often add new widgets to your home screen, when you do, the widgets that support this feature will show you actual content before adding them. This is in real time and reflects real items on your phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, it’s very new, mostly found in just a couple of Google’s apps, primarily in the Clock app. It would be great to see more Google apps and third-party applications adopt this capability. For instance, I want to see my actual Notion boards before I add the widget, rather than a placeholder example. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another enhancement is the new back animation when navigating through settings or any layered menus; it feels smoother and nicer. Bluetooth audio sharing is another feature, allowing multiple headphones to pair to the same audio source as long as they support Bluetooth LE, which most modern headphones do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there’s High Quality Mode when using your Android phone as a webcam, and Bluetooth Auto On, which automatically turns Bluetooth back on the next day if you turned it off, so you don’t have to remember to do it. These, along with a plethora of other small enhancements, show how Google pays attention to how we use our phones and continuously improves on those areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, speaking of little things, I have number three as one of those subtle improvements: the new volume sliders. Right now, when I hit Volume, it looks familiar. The Auto Live Caption button is still present on the Pixel, which is a totally underrated feature, and then your mode switcher at the top. When you hit the three dots to expand, you get a nearly full-screen overlay showing where audio is playing and all the volume levels for everything happening on your phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "This big overlay makes it super clear what's going on and how loud each individual component will be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we’re getting to the top. Number two is partial screen recordings. Normally, when you screen record on your phone, you expect to see everything—your home screen, every app you switch to, everything happening on your phone. But I've been testing screen recordings on the Pixel with this dev preview, and it’s now smarter about showing only specific things, if that’s what you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you initiate a screen recording, you can choose between recording the entire screen or a single app. For example, if I select a single app and start recording, it allows me to pick which app to record. Let’s say I choose Relay for Reddit. After the countdown, it records only this app, and I can scroll around and use it as usual. If I switch to another app, like Photos, that doesn’t appear in the screen recording; it continues to capture only the Reddit app.\n",
      "\n",
      "This focused recording is incredibly useful. You can avoid showing irrelevant notifications or security codes in recordings. It’s simply about showing exactly what you want people to see. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, number one: better notifications and notification management. Android has excelled in this area for years, and with these two previews, it’s even better, specifically in a few ways. There’s Adaptive Vibration, Notification Cool Down, and custom vibrations, among other features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adaptive Vibration is intriguing. It uses the phone's microphone and sensors to assess the sound levels in the environment, adjusting the vibration strength accordingly. If your phone is on a hard surface, it may vibrate at a lower intensity, while it may vibrate more firmly on a soft surface like a couch, ensuring you still hear it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another feature, Notification Cool Down, is aimed at managing notifications from the same app that come in rapidly. Many of us have experienced a group chat or Slack channel that won't stop buzzing, and enabling this feature helps limit those repeating notifications while still keeping you updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, while this was present in Dev Preview 1, it appears to be missing in Dev Preview 2. I hope they bring it back—it’s a great feature. \n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also the subtle option of individual vibration patterns per app. Historically, smartphones had LED notification lights that would blink in different colors according to the app sending the notification. Now, developers can customize vibration patterns for their apps, and I’m hopeful that this feature will also be made available to users. I’d love to know when I get a Twitter notification without having to check my phone each time. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the versioning, it doesn’t say Android 15 in Settings; it currently lists Vanilla Ice Cream for Dev Preview 2. When you click into it, you see an animated Easter egg that looks somewhat space-like. If you hold it down long enough, it speeds up and transforms into a sort of random spacecraft exploring an expansive cosmic scene. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, there are some subtle changes, new notification features, and enhanced management aspects. It’s all nuanced and refined. I’m still looking forward to major AI-based features because that’ll be the stuff that makes a significant difference in how we use our phones. For now, it’s good to see solid OS features. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know your favorite feature or if you agree with my ranking of the top five in the comments below. Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace. \n",

      "Alright, it's mid-2024, so you know what that means: another new version of iOS is coming to an iPhone near you. I've been testing the newest version, iOS 18, on my iPhone for the past couple of weeks. It’s been in beta, and now that the public beta is out, you can also test it before its full release in September. There are some interesting features in this version.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, I mentioned that almost every new feature was heavily ecosystem-based, meaning they relied on having a friend with an iPhone or some other Apple device in your life. However, this time it’s kind of the opposite—these are largely new features for the iPhone itself, which I really appreciate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For this video, I’m leaving out Apple Intelligence features. That's more of a separate topic that I haven't been able to test in the pre-release betas. I’ll make a separate video about that once it's actually testable, so be sure to subscribe to catch that.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s dive into the top five new features of iOS 18.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Number five: The new Control Center.**  \n",
      "I placed this at number five because, while there is quite a bit of new stuff here, I’m not sure I like all the changes. When you pull down from the corner, the new Control Center is more colorful and paginated, with three pages now. Honestly, I'll probably never use the second two pages, but they serve as a full-page visualizer for any media that’s playing, along with an array of one-touch toggles for your basic connectivity options. However, this full-page list is just an expanded version of what was previously on the first page, requiring a few more taps to access.  \n",
      "\n",
      "On that first page, if you hit the plus button in the corner, it displays a grid allowing you to customize the size and placement of anything that has a tab in that bottom corner. Each tab has predefined sizes that they morph between, enabling you to design your perfect layout for the control screen. You can add new controls, and there’s a massive list of them to sift through for things you frequently use. Currently, these are mostly Apple app controls.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What I’m really looking forward to is the integration of third-party app controls. Right now, none are available, but I can't wait for features like one-touch control for the AC in my car or instantly accessing the barcode scanner in my calorie tracker app. Having more controls in this section is going to be pretty great.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve also noticed a new flashlight control that allows you to adjust the intensity and beam width of the flashlight. While I find the intensity adjustment works wonderfully, I’m not entirely convinced about the beam width functionality yet. However, it’s still a neat addition.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there’s a new button for turning off your phone, similar to what Android introduced a while back in their settings. Finally, you can customize the controls on your lock screen! Instead of the default flashlight and camera, you can now hold down, tap customize, and make changes. I hope third-party options are included, but there are already plenty of choices. I'm excited to set mine to my to-do list app someday.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Number four: The Passwords app.**  \n",
      "Occasionally, an update installs a new app on everyone’s phones, and this is one of those. Essentially, it pulls all the password tools previously hidden in the settings into one dedicated app. Your iPhone has been saving your passwords for a while, including Wi-Fi passcodes, so this app serves as a simple way to find and manage everything in one place.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This app also supports new features like two-factor authentication and passkeys, along with some additional functions that might convince you to switch from your current password manager app to Apple’s Passwords app. For instance, in the bottom left, you can create shared passwords and passkeys with a group of trusted contacts that also have iPhones. When signing up for a new account, it continues its usual function of generating secure passwords and offering to remember them for you.  \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I found interesting is that rather than using a master password, it defaults to Face ID. If you have Face ID set up on your iPhone, that’s what you’ll use to log in. The main reason I won’t be using this app is that I still use an Android phone, and there’s currently no Android version of this Passwords app available. However, they did make a Mac app and a Chrome extension, which is intriguing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Number three: The new home screen customization.**  \n",
      "Some of you might have expected this to be higher, perhaps even number one or two, but I have my reasons. The day has finally come—there's new home screen customization available for iPhone, somewhat. While there are great features, there are also some oddities.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the good part: iPhone users can now place their icons anywhere on their home screens! Welcome to 2024, iPhone users! Although everything still snaps to a grid, you can now place icons on the right side or the bottom of your home screen where they are easily reachable without snapping back to the top. That's a great improvement! They started with widgets, and now they’ve added this functionality.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To customize further, tap and hold anywhere on the home screen to access the edit button at the top. From there, you can hit customize and explore the limited customization menu available for the iPhone. You can choose between dark mode, which slightly darkens your wallpaper and updates compatible icons, or light mode, which does the opposite.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There's also a button to make all your icons larger, removing the text for a cleaner look. However, there's a tinted button that feels a bit off. This button allows you to tint all your home screen icons to a single color, which can theoretically match your wallpaper. Interestingly, you can pick a specific color from your wallpaper as the tint. Despite how it sounds, I haven’t found any combination that looks appealing at all.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While some apps with simple, high-contrast icons look fine, others, particularly third-party apps, appear completely illegible. The inconsistency creates a visual disparity that's not pleasant. Even Apple widgets like the weather app can look great in contrast, while others fall flat. Google has experimented with similar concepts in Android, with mixed success, but I believe the tinting method will improve over time as more icons are updated to support it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Number two: The little things.**  \n",
      "There are numerous tiny improvements and features that aren't huge individually, but collectively add up to a much better experience. Many of these didn't even make the keynote! For example, there’s a game mode that gives CPU priority to any active game, reducing Bluetooth latency for wireless headphones or controllers—a simple but nice touch.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Photos app has undergone a redesign, and the smart search functionality is much improved. When searching for something like \"license plate,\" it not only recognizes and retrieves relevant photos but also suggests ways to narrow down the results to find exactly what you're looking for.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there are now numerous shortcuts to Shazam integrated throughout, including a preset in the Action button settings. I found that interesting given that Apple acquired Shazam not long ago.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, RCS support appears to be live on the iPhone in 2024. While it still shows as a green bubble for texting, you can now send high-quality media between any modern Android phone and an iPhone. I sent a three-megabyte image file from my iPhone to my Android device and received it intact, without quality loss. Now, you also get typing indicators and read receipts. Reactions work smoothly too. While it's not fully integrated into blue-bubble iMessage as some may have hoped, Apple can finally claim they’ve achieved this functionality.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Number one: The calculator.**  \n",
      "Believe it or not, the best new feature in iOS 18 is **the calculator**! You might have thought this was only for the iPad since we saw it demoed in the iPadOS 18 keynote, but it’s on the iPhone too!  \n",
      "\n",
      "When you open the Calculator app, it looks like a basic calculator—very familiar. However, there’s a toggle in the bottom left that lets you switch to a scientific calculator, which is nice. The new feature is called Math Notes, which transforms the calculator into a notes-like app. You can create a new note and start handwriting math calculations. If you write an equation and add an equal sign, it automatically solves that equation for you and keeps it updated as you continue writing or typing. It’s impressive.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This feature can handle variables and graphs, essentially doing everything I’ve been asking Wolfram|Alpha to do lately. An underrated aspect is how well-considered it is, syncing across devices just like notes do. If you add calculations on your iPhone, they’re accessible on your iPad's calculator, and you can edit them seamlessly. If you redefine a variable in your note, the calculator recognizes that new value while keeping the old one for previous calculations. It’s astonishingly well thought out.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, this functionality is easier on a bigger screen with an Apple Pencil, but remember, I was doing this with a paper notebook and a TI-84 in school. I genuinely wish I had a tool like this in my educational years. The handwriting recognition is excellent, handling equations seamlessly, and it even presents answers in your handwriting while indexing everything for easy searching. It’s impressive—more than any other feature I’ve seen in iOS 18. That’s why it’s my number one feature.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, that sums up my top five. But as I mentioned, subscribe to see a deep dive into Apple Intelligence because that topic is crucial to understanding the entire Apple ecosystem. That video is coming soon! Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you in the next one. Peace!\n",

      "I think Google might have done it this time. The only reason I hesitate is that I've had this exact same feeling and said this same line before about the Pixel 6. Google’s phones have always been focused on software, and we've just wanted them to improve their hardware to have a truly competitive phone. But I think they’ve done it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Google had their Pixel 9 event, and there’s more than just the new Pixel phones on display. They also introduced a new watch and new Pixel Buds, which I'll touch on later, but I want to focus this video on the new phones because I’ve been waiting for these for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several models: the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Some people find the names a bit confusing; honestly, it's not that bad, maybe except for the Fold. The base model, the Pixel 9, starts at $799 and features a 6.3-inch screen size. It has a new design with flat matte metal sides and a polished glass back available in four colors: Porcelain (white), Obsidian (black), Wintergreen, and Peony—definitely reminiscent of Cosmo and Wanda vibes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have the two Pro models: the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL. What’s impressive is that the Pixel 9 Pro is the same size as the Pixel 9, similar to what Apple has been doing with the iPhone. The only difference with the XL version is that it has a larger 6.8-inch screen and a bigger battery. The Pro models start at $999 and $1,099, and they come with an additional telephoto camera, more RAM, and glossy rails with a soft-touch glass back. They are available in Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel, and Rose Quartz, which is a nice muted pink.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the chance to handle these phones for about two hours, and from the very beginning, I thought, “Wow, yes, Google has done it. These phones genuinely feel and look like actual flagships.” It’s not just the trend toward flat sides that I like; these phones feel a bit heavier in the hand now, providing a more solid feel. The screens are all significantly brighter too. The Pixel 9's Actua display is 35% brighter than that of the Pixel 8, and the bezels are thinner all around. Plus, finally, there’s an ultrasonic fingerprint reader under the display instead of the optical one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera visor on the back is polarizing. Some will love it, some won’t, but I find the large lens opening quite promising. Of course, I need to fully test all these features for a more thorough review, but my first impression is that the photos will be very Pixel-like—punchy and contrasty—thanks to the larger sensors that potentially allow for a shallower depth of field.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of design, while I prefer the older camera bumps, I'm warming up to these new ones. I miss the full visor around the camera area, but the flat island design remains distinctive and unique to Pixel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s summarize the specs. All the new Pixels feature the same Tensor G4 chip, which is said to be more powerful and efficient, boasting improved AI capabilities. Noticeably, the primary and ultra-wide cameras remain the same between the base and Pro models. This makes the base model look like a great deal, but it does mean there’s not a lot of hardware difference between the base and Pro versions for the $200 price difference this year. For that, the Pro model provides possibly a slightly better screen, a telephoto camera, more RAM, and an enhanced selfie camera. That’s about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t want to judge too early because I haven’t benchmarked it or tested long-term performance, but Google claims the Tensor is 20% faster for web browsing and 17% faster for app launching, and I believe them. These phones feel really quick and snappy from my initial impressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m particularly pleased that there’s now a smaller phone that packs all the benefits of the Pro model. Many people want a better phone without it being gigantic, so having a Pro version without a Pro Max option is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally, these wouldn’t be Pixel phones without a plethora of AI features. Some exciting new updates are coming with these Pixel 9s, including a revamped Weather app, a new Screenshots app, and Pixel Studio. The Google Weather app has been redesigned with a tile format and a modern look. At the top, there’s an AI-generated comment about the weather, sometimes even suggesting what to wear. I don’t often use stock weather apps, but this is a nice addition for those who do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new Screenshots app is intriguing. While not everyone may find it useful, it consolidates all your screenshots in one place, scanning them for information that can remind or assist you later. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there’s Pixel Studio, which lets you create AI-generated art right on your device using simple text prompts. Apple recently announced something similar in iOS 18, but it’s not out yet. The demo showed it quickly generating images—around three seconds—which is neat that it works offline too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Magic Editor in photos introduces a new Reimagine feature that lets you highlight a section in your pictures and reimagine it as something else entirely—a more advanced take on tools like Samsung's sketch-to-image feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most impressive features is the new Add Me function in the camera. If you’re in a group and want to take a picture but lack someone to capture the shot, this feature guides you through the process. First, you take a shot without yourself in it, leaving space for you. Then a friend positions themselves while you pose, and the camera merges both images into a single group photo. It retains the originals too.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other enhancements like better Clear Calling, Call Notes that summarize phone calls, and Gemini Live for having conversations with an assistant, though that's a bit confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I was most excited about the hardware of these new phones. Now, let’s talk about the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. I’m not sure why it’s not just called the Pixel Fold 2, but the naming might be easier to remember since everything else is under the 9 banner. Regardless, it’s a significant improvement over last year’s Pixel Fold, still priced at $1,799.\n",
      "\n",
      "Google really improved the Fold model. The previous one often got dubbed the best foldable to use when closed—which is somewhat of a backhanded compliment—but this new model features a larger 6.3-inch external display and is much brighter, at 80% more than the last model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inside boasts an eight-inch display that mirrors the outside screen layout. The design has metal rails and soft-touch matte glass, giving it a more premium feel than ever. The thinness of the device is impressive, ensuring it’s easy to handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the camera bump is a bit disappointing. It lacks thoughtful design, but I can overlook it given the overall quality of the phone. It feels fantastic when open and nice when closed, seemingly better than the previous best foldable, the OnePlus Open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, battery life and camera quality still need testing, but my initial impression is quite positive. The Pro Fold also includes the Tensor G4 chip, 16 GB of RAM, and all the AI features introduced in the new Pixels. It’s also IPX8 rated, meaning it can withstand splashes. Google mentioned collaborating with developers to optimize games for the internal screen, which I look forward to seeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone comes in two colors: Porcelain and Obsidian. Consider me very interested; I’ve stepped away from foldables for my daily driver recently, but I think the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a chance to bring me back, especially with its massive eight-inch display.\n",
      "\n",
      "These new phones feel like they’ve genuinely achieved the modern upgrade we've been hoping for from Google’s flagship line. The main spec I noticed missing is Qi2, which is disappointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "As promised, it’s not just the phones on display. The new Pixel Watch 3 retains the same design but now comes in two sizes. A larger 45-millimeter version offers around 40% more screen. The bezels are smaller, and the screens are brighter, reaching up to 2,000 nits.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a new body score feature that summarizes your metrics into a single score, a feature that seems to have gained traction across multiple brands. Additionally, they’ve introduced new running features. The most notable update is a dual-chip architecture designed for longer battery life, claiming up to 36 hours in Battery Saver mode. This isn’t groundbreaking, but it should improve on last year's model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pricing remains the same: $349 for the smaller model and $399 for the larger one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, let’s talk about the new Pixel Buds, now called the Pixel Buds Pro 2. The design has been updated to be smaller, featuring little bud shapes without stalks, and comes with a stabilizer fin for better fit. A new custom-designed A1 chip enhances active noise cancellation and overall sound quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also have conversations with Gemini Live directly through the Buds, making it an interesting feature. I plan to test these out as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please let me know what aspects you’re most interested in for full reviews! I aim to get my hands on as many products as possible, so subscribe to see more. What excites you most—the AI features, the camera improvements, or the new hardware? Let me know in the comments below.\n",

      "Years ago, I posted a poll on Twitter asking how many of you use a case on your phone, and about three-quarters said yes. Given that phones have only become more expensive, I understand the trend. If you’re considering a case for your new phone, I recommend the Grip Case from channel sponsor dbrand. It comes in matte black, is super grippy, features clicky buttons, and provides strong magnets for protection. I’ll leave a link below if you want to check it out.\n",

      "Okay, what exactly is happening with the iPhone's camera? We've conducted years of blind smartphone camera tests, and the iPhone, supposedly one of the premium cameras in the entire smartphone industry, consistently loses in the first round. Then, we do a scientific version with over 20 million votes, and it finishes in the middle of the pack. \"And yet, Marques, you named it the best overall smartphone camera system for the fourth time running in 2022 and gave it a trophy. What's up with that?\" A concerning number of people have started to notice that the iPhone’s camera feels like it has taken a few steps back lately, and I agree with them. I think we should take a closer look at this.\n",
      "\n",
      "(relaxed music)\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, cameras have come a long way. Smartphone cameras aren't just cameras anymore. Back in the day, a camera was basically a sensor that would travel around covered all the time. When you wanted to take a photo, you would expose that sensitive bit to the environment around it, collecting light. The photo would then represent how much light hit each part of the sensor. The better the sensor, the better the image, and the more light information you could capture—super simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "These days though, it's turned into a whole computational event. Your smartphone sensor is sampling the environment not just once, but often several times in rapid succession at different speeds. It's merging exposures together, doing tone mapping, noise reduction, and HDR processing—all to create what it thinks is the best-looking image. This, of course, is a very different definition of a picture. Now, it’s not just about having the best sensor that gathers the most light information; software makes a much bigger difference in how the image looks at the end of the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next time you watch a smartphone reveal event, take note of all the new additions, and notice how many of them are pure software. Google really struck gold when they first started using the IMX363 sensor with the Pixel 3's camera. Their software tuning was just right, making it an instant smash hit. They continued using that camera combo in every subsequent Pixel model: the 3, 3a, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, and even the Pixel 6a. Year after year, same sensor, same software tuning combo—if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when the Pixel 6a won December's scientific blind smartphone camera test, it was with a four-year-old sensor and software tuning combination that was still performing exceptionally well. In side-by-side comparisons of compressed images, where you can't really judge sharpness or depth of field much, this combo nailed the basics better than anyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Pixel 6 came along, Google updated their design and branding and changed to a new sensor with this new camera system, moving from the tried-and-true 12-megapixel to a massive new 50-megapixel sensor. This change threw a wrench into things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It looks to me like the Pixel is over-sharpening. The one on the left looks too crunchy.\" The camera on the Pixel 6 does have a habit of making things look overly HDR. I'm not sure if there’s a technical term for that. \"If you look at all the photos, it's clear the Pixel is still doing Pixel things.\" I think Google is still running all their camera algorithms at maximum, even when they don’t need to anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "New phones with much larger sensors are still processing images like their smaller predecessors. The basic principle is that they were doing all this processing with old sensors as if they weren’t getting much light, but suddenly they had this massive new sensor that could capture way more light. Yet, they continued running all the same processing. They would do high-sensitivity processing and then apply noise reduction, but since noise reduction requires sharpening afterward, the photos ended up overprocessed. \n",
      "\n",
      "This fancy new phone comes out with a new camera system, but you could argue that the older Pixel still took better-looking photos. Google had to work hard behind the scenes to make some adjustments to the software and dial in this new sensor. It took a while, but now with the Pixel 7 out, a full year later with the same huge 50-megapixel sensor, they’re back on track. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, the Pixel 7 finished just behind the Pixel 6a in the blind camera test. When I see iPhone 14 Pro photos looking inconsistent and a bit overprocessed, I spot a lot of the same issues that Google faced with the Pixel. The iPhone story is somewhat similar. They used a small 12-megapixel sensor for years, then the 13 Pro sensor got slightly bigger, but this year, the iPhone 14 Pro is the first to bump up to a significantly larger 48-megapixel sensor. As a result, some iPhone photos are looking a little too processed. It’s not extreme, but it's noticeable, and they’ll have to work on this.\n",

      "I suspect that by the time we get to the iPhone 15 Pro, they will have new software adjustments. I imagine there will be some new wording they use on stage—like they introduced Deep Fusion and pixel-binning—perhaps to explain some software improvements to the camera. I think this will keep improving with software updates over time, and they’ll get it dialed in. I believe it will be fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this doesn’t explain why all the previous 12-megapixel iPhones also lost in the first round of our tests. This is a separate issue that I’m a bit more curious about. As you may recall, all of our testing photos featured me intentionally. We designed the tests to incorporate as many potential factors as possible to judge a photo. If it were just a picture of a figurine in front of a plain background, the winner would likely be just whichever one was brighter or had better color. \n",
      "\n",
      "But with the figurine placed in a more complex background, we’re judging both color and background blur. Add a sky to the mix, and now we’re also testing dynamic range and HDR. Our latest photo included lots of factors: two different skin tones, two differently colored shirts, textures for sharpness, a sky for dynamic range, short-range falloff on one side, and long-range falloff on the other. With all these factors, whichever photo people pick as the winner could be seen as closer to the best overall photo.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also wanted the pictures to feature humans since the most important photos people typically take are of other humans. Using my own face revealed a lot about how different smartphones handle photographing a human face. As I’ve already mentioned, smartphone cameras rely heavily on software, meaning the photo you get when you hit the shutter isn’t so much a capture of reality as it is a computer's best interpretation of what it thinks you want reality to look like. \n",
      "\n",
      "Each company has different ways of optimizing their pictures. They used to be more transparent about it. Some phones would identify when you were taking a landscape photo and enhance the greens in the grass or boost the blues in a sky shot to make it look nicer. I did a video on smartphone cameras versus reality, which I’ll link below the Like button if you want to check it out. But the point is, when you snap a photo, you’re not always getting an accurate capture of what was in front of you—many adjustments are being made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iPhone, for instance, identifies faces and tries to evenly light them. It tries every time. This seems pretty harmless, right? If you ask people what they think should look good in a photo, the idea of evenly lighting all the faces sounds reasonable. Often, it ends up looking fine, but it can lead to issues. For example, in our low-light photo test from the blind camera test, the Pixel 7 on the left looks standard, while the iPhone 14 Pro, which finished in the middle of the pack, displays some oddities. The iPhone completely removed the shadow from half of my face. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am clearly lit from a side source, but in the iPhone’s interpretation, it’s impossible to tell where the light is coming from. Sometimes, you encounter bizarre results like this, which can be traced back to software choices. Another issue is skin tones. I’ve mentioned that I often prefer photos from the Pixel’s camera, and we’ve done plenty of tests featuring me. The results look great on the Pixel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Google has implemented a feature called Real Tone in the Pixel camera over the past few years. Although it doesn’t get much attention, it makes a significant difference. Historically, film cameras tended to be calibrated for lighter skin tones, leaving people with darker skin underexposed. Today, smartphone cameras are software-based, meaning they can make adjustments for various skin tones, but they do this to varying degrees. \n",
      "\n",
      "You might have noticed that many phones sold in China brighten faces uniformly since that’s a popular aesthetic in that region. Google goes the extra mile to train their camera software with diverse datasets that accurately represent various skin tones. Apple’s cameras, from what I’ve observed, tend to just aim to evenly light faces without accounting for the different white balances and exposures necessary for accurately representing diverse skin tones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, this is a substantial factor in the Pixel’s success, with many smartphones that accurately depict my skin tone finishing higher in our blind voting. People consider how well a camera performs with different tones when casting their votes. I haven’t mentioned this often, but one reason I’ve really liked RED cameras is their accurate representation of skin tones compared to other brands like Sony, ARRI, and Canon.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this software complexity explains why photo comparisons between modern smartphones are so challenging. There are many channels that conduct side-by-side photo tests quite well, but as you try to pick one over another, you might prefer one phone's landscape rendering over another’s, while a different phone does a superior job with your own skin tone or perhaps your pet’s photo.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m sure Apple will defend all their current camera capabilities, but I’m also certain they’re working to fine-tune these new cameras and improve them with the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, back to the original question we set out to answer: \"Marques, you like the Pixel photos, the Pixel 6a won the blind scientific camera test, but you still awarded best overall camera system to the iPhone 14 Pro. Why?\" If you listen closely, you’ve already gotten the answer. That scientific test measured one specific thing: small postage-stamp-sized images and general color metrics, but sharpness and detail under compression weren’t assessed. \n",
      "\n",
      "We didn’t test the speed or reliability of autofocus either, or the open-close time of the camera app, or the speed and reliability of capturing a shot. Video quality wasn’t tested either, including microphone quality, video sharpness, HDR, and all of that. Maybe someday we’ll test those factors comprehensively, but for now, the lesson learned is that the visually appealing photos that come from the Pixel—or whatever phone you're using—are composed of photons but are primarily the result of processing.\n",

      "- All right, so this is simultaneously really impressive and really frightening. It's hitting me in ways that I didn’t really expect. Do you remember Will Smith eating spaghetti? Back when we said, “Okay, this AI stuff is cool and all, but clearly there’s a long way to go before there’s any need for concern”? Well, welcome to the future, people, because this video is also AI-generated. So is this one—completely synthesized out of thin air by computers. And this one too—this is not real. It’s absolutely ridiculous how far we’ve come in just one year. This feels like another ChatGPT, DALL·E moment for AI. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I’m overreacting because, okay, I am a video creator, so an AI that’s actually doing my job feels a bit more threatening; I’m particularly impressed by it. But also, this stuff is really good. Today, Sam Altman and OpenAI announced a new model called Sora, and it can generate full video clips up to one minute long from just text input. Just like DALL·E was able to understand our text input and turn it into photo-realistic or stylized images, Sora does the same with videos. Now, since it’s handling videos, it must also understand how reflections, textures, materials, and physics interact over time to create a believable video. \n",
      "\n",
      "Right away, there are a bunch of crazy examples on their website. Before I show you these, I need you to keep this in mind: you’re about to watch a bunch of AI-generated videos, and you know you’re watching AI-generated content. Your brain will already be looking for imperfections, and while they exist, not everyone who sees AI-generated content online is looking for those flaws. Also, this is the worst that this technology will be from here on out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, here’s one of the videos. There’s no audio to any of these clips, but the prompt for this one is: “A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm, glowing neon and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and black boots.” This video is already miles ahead of where we were. It has accurate lighting, materials, skin tones, movements, and even reflections everywhere. Of course, if you scrutinize it closely for more than about ten seconds, you’ll find lots of giveaways. For instance, a guy in the background seems to be gliding oddly. The frame rates and the reflections in the water are lower than in the rest of the video, and the camera movement feels a bit inconsistent. Overall, everything just feels a little off—yet just keep in mind how far we’ve come in just a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "How about this one? This is another video with a long prompt about a camera following behind a white vintage SUV with a black roof rack as it speeds up a steep dirt road. This one is also really good. It looks a bit more video game-like due to the rock-solid drone footage, but it's clearly usable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s another one featuring a litter of golden retriever puppies playing in the snow. Their heads pop in and out of the snow, and it’s so good. The physics of the fur, the ears, and the snow flying around in slow motion are incredible. I’ve gone through all the sample videos on OpenAI’s website, and clearly, these are the handpicked best ones they chose to share, where they just input text and then got a video without any modifications. But there are some genuinely impressive results, both realistic and stylized, some featuring people and some not. A lot of them are in slow motion. I have to say, the speed at which these models are improving is genuinely shocking. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just months ago, DALL·E 3 produced really high-end results, but you could still find something off about it. For example, it struggled with realistic human features—something about hands or ears always seemed a little off; not to mention the physics. But even this video is insane at first glance. The prompt for this AI-generated video is: “A young man in his 20s is sitting on a piece of cloud in the sky reading a book.” This one feels about 90% of the way there for me. It’s beyond the uncanny valley of say, Apple’s personas, which are based on real humans. This is a made-up person. His eyes look somewhat strange, the motion of the pages in the book is odd, and yes, he’s sitting on a cloud, which is a giveaway. But the lighting, shadows, skin tones, and the realism of the textures on his shirt and the way his shirt, pants, and hair move are all very impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "For another example, they typed in a movie trailer featuring the adventures of a 30-year-old spaceman wearing a red wool motorcycle helmet against a blue sky and salt desert in a cinematic style, shot on 35mm film. The close-ups of his face, the fabrics of the helmet, the film grain—this is one of the most convincing AI-generated videos I’ve ever seen, minus maybe the strange physics with the character walking in fast motion. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you follow Sam Altman on Twitter, he’s been posting more videos generated from people's requests. So if you want to see more, check out his profile. Here’s the thing about these AI-generated videos: as good as they’ve gotten, they can and will pass as real videos to people who are not looking for AI content. This is obviously sketchy during an election year in the U.S. and terrifying for a variety of other reasons, but it’s also perfect for stock footage. There are all kinds of presentations, advertisements, and PowerPoints that desperately need oddly specific stock videos, and these AI-generated clips are good enough to 100% pass for that purpose. \n",
      "\n",
      "Take this video of waves at Big Sur, for example. If I saw this on Twitter, I wouldn’t even think twice; I’d just think, “Oh, nice drone shot.” I wouldn’t suspect it was generated by AI unless I scrutinized the way the water was moving. It’s perfectly usable in an ad for a California-based product, which has significant implications for drone pilots who may no longer need to be hired and photographers and videographers whose footage no longer requires licensing for that ad being produced. It’s already that impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other visuals, like this wall of TVs, which would be expensive and complicated to shoot with a camera and all those costly props. But if you could generate it with reflections and the surrounding environment this well, why wouldn’t you? It’s also capable of producing historical-themed footage. For example, this is AI-generated footage of California during the Gold Rush. It could easily pass for the opening scene of an old Western with the right music overlay.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long will it be until an entire ad consists of completely AI-generated shots? Or an entire YouTube video? Or even a whole movie? I’m tempted to say we’re a long way from that because these still have noticeable flaws, and they lack sound. There’s still a long way to go with prompt engineering to sort these issues out. But then again, the spaghetti video was just a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI also showcases some of the shortcomings of this model, and who would know better than the people using it? It's a very private tool at the moment, with limited access only for testers—essentially red teamers pushing the limits—and a few trusted creators. They’ve found some strange quirks in certain videos. For instance, this clip of gray wolf pups looks normal initially, but it’s evident something is off as they appear from nowhere and walk through each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there’s this bizarre clip of a guy running on a treadmill. I don’t even need to elaborate on why this is odd.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's my favorite example. Just imagine you’re scrolling through Facebook or Twitter, not expecting to see AI content, and you suddenly see this video of a grandma celebrating her birthday. You might wonder, “I wonder what birthday she’s celebrating. How old do you think she is? 60? 65? Maybe it’s the big 70.” She seems to really enjoy that cake. Now, did you catch that? I’ll play it again, but this time, pay attention, knowing that AI-generated photos and videos often struggle with hands. As I replay it, you’re likely to notice the inconsistency. Watch it multiple times, and you’ll see different sets of hands, making it feel weirder every time. The inconsistencies just become more pronounced. Not to mention the strange variations in the wind’s direction on the candles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as I point all this out, I can’t help but remember that just twelve months ago, we were critiquing much less sophisticated outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what does all this mean? Well, there’s the current impact and what it implies for the future. Sora, the tool they’ve developed, is clearly an impressive AI video generation tool. It will both deceive viewers and be incredibly useful. Every video it generates has a watermark in the bottom corner, serving as a clear indicator that it’s an AI product—if it hasn’t been cropped out, of course. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, I think they’ll need to exercise extreme caution with this technology. They’ll have to implement stringent safety measures, perhaps even more so than with DALL·E. For instance, you shouldn’t be able to generate someone’s likeness without their consent, especially this election year. You probably won’t be able to recreate something like Will Smith eating spaghetti, but it definitely means there will be a significant impact on stock video licensing. Logistically, why would anyone producing content pay for footage of a house on the cliffs when they can generate one for free or for a small subscription fee? That is the real concern that this tool raises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead, it gets existential. If this model is trained on all videos ever created by humans, can it be innovative or creative in ways humans haven't already achieved? I don't know. Regardless, I’ll include all the relevant links below for Sora and OpenAI’s work. I guess I’ll talk to you next year when we look back and think, “Remember that first version of Sora?” Just keep in mind, this is the worst this technology will be from now on. \n",

      "So this smartwatch has one really interesting trick up its sleeve that I haven’t seen in any other, and honestly, I don't think we’re ever going to see again. At this point, we know what a smartwatch is, right? This is a stable, mature category. They deliver mostly across the board on all the same functions, and aside from the one crazy trick, this one is no exception. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is the OnePlus Watch 2, three years after the original OnePlus Watch, and it costs 300 bucks. For the $300 you're spending, you're getting a pretty nice circular watch design. It comes in a black or silver stainless steel body with a sapphire cover glass over a 1.4-inch, 60 Hz AMOLED display. \n",
      "\n",
      "Design-wise, you could argue it takes cues from maybe the OnePlus 11 or the OnePlus 12, particularly in the way the camera bump is integrated into the side rail of the phone. They've done a similar thing here with the buttons on the side of the watch. There's a circular button at the top and a rectangular button at the bottom. I kind of like it; it’s a nice shape, offering a subtle, classy variation from the pure circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The back looks pretty standard too, with four pins at the top for charging and all the sensors you’d expect: an optical heart rate sensor, a pulse oximeter for blood oxygen, and of course, interchangeable bands, just like the first generation. The whole thing is both IP68 dust and water-resistant and meets a US military standard for durability, meaning it can withstand extreme temperatures, moisture, and shock among other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not too heavy; it’s built pretty well. This display goes up to a thousand nits peak brightness, which looks great. So what’s the catch? What’s the weird twist? Well, I mentioned that we already kind of know what a smartwatch is—a tiny computer on your wrist with a tiny screen and a tiny battery. And that’s fine; they all tend to have pretty short battery lives because they’re so small, so you typically charge them every day. \n",
      "\n",
      "The main competitors here are the Apple Watch, which claims 18 hours, though that may not be the most direct comparison since that’s connected with the iPhone; then you have the Galaxy Watch, one of the best, which offers 40 hours of battery life, and the Pixel Watch, the newest one, with 24 hours. But this OnePlus watch is claiming 100 hours—100-hour battery life in Smart Mode, which is not a battery-saving mode; it's actually the default setting out of the box. \n",
      "\n",
      "100 hours. So 96 hours is four days. I feel like 100 sounds cooler, so they just went with that. But four days of battery life sounds a lot less inconvenient. So I had to put that to the test. For the past four straight days, I've been that guy walking around with both an Apple Watch Ultra, which claims 36 hours of normal use, and this OnePlus Watch, doing all the same tasks: getting notifications, working out, and just exploring the UI.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end, I was actually very impressed with both. The $800 Apple Watch Ultra performed beyond the 36 hours it claimed; by hour 56, it was about ready to die. Meanwhile, the OnePlus Watch had about 15% battery left. You’re probably thinking, wait, that’s not even close to 100; it’s around 50 something. But OnePlus told me that if you turn the always-on display off, that’s good for two more days of battery life—it’s actually off by default. \n",
      "\n",
      "I turned it on for this test, but that would get you well over the 100-hour mark. To be fair, that’s probably true for the Apple Watch Ultra too. A detail to consider that mattered for this test: I’ve been wearing hoodies a lot because of the weather, and with the sleeves covering the watch, it thinks it’s in the dark. The light sensors are blocked, so it turns the brightness way down on the watch. I think that’s why it outperformed its claimed battery numbers, as I had a sleeve over it a lot of the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "But even still, this $300 watch outperformed the $800 smartwatch in terms of battery life. Now here’s the twist. The way they’re achieving this battery life is even more interesting than the battery life itself. Most smartwatches have a chip inside that computes everything with some high-powered cores and some high-efficiency cores to balance power and battery life. This watch has two entirely separate processors and two different operating systems running for each of them. \n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a high-powered Snapdragon W5 inside that powers Wear OS 4, which only activates for tasks requiring it. Then there’s also a BES 2700 chip that is always on and runs RTOS. They share the same 32 GB of base storage and 2 GB of RAM. Wear OS kicks in for more intensive tasks like maps or music playback, while the always-on RTOS manages basic, low-power functions: heart rate monitoring, phone calls, notifications, and background tasks. It’s like a hybrid car; really interesting. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a fully electric car, you get the benefits of being responsive but not the best range. A gas car has a lot of range but isn't as responsive as fully electric. If you get a hybrid, you get the best of both worlds: responsiveness and range. This watch acts as a hybrid, combining responsiveness and battery longevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been impressed using this; it’s responsive and offers a ton of watch faces. There are many custom workouts that feel very familiar and track everything, sending all the data to the OHealth app in detail. I do wish that shoveling snow was a workout type, but that’s another story. These are regular weightlifting workouts. Also, I really like that you hold to end the workout, rather than tapping; it's much harder to accidentally stop a workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, there’s a weird quirk: this button has a crown that rotates, but it doesn’t actually do anything—it doesn’t change the volume or scroll; it just spins freely. Apparently, that’s literally just for durability upon impact, serving no functional purpose. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another hitch I’ve noticed is the delay when checking notifications. I feel the buzz on my wrist, lift it up, and it takes about two seconds to show me the notification. Not that two seconds is a disaster, but it’s longer than expected, and it annoys me to wait compared to other watches that show notifications immediately. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can see the moment the Snapdragon W5 fires up and Wear OS snaps on before displaying the notification. It’s very odd. Here’s the other twist: I don’t think this dual-chip system is the only factor behind this impressive battery life because this watch also has a 500 mAh battery. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, 500 mAh doesn’t sound like a lot, but when compared to other smartwatches in this category, it’s a bit bigger than you’d expect. If I gave the Pixel Watch 2—which also has a Snapdragon W5—a 500 mAh battery, do we think it would last 50 hours? I don’t know, but there you go. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, at the end of the day, I’m truly impressed that they managed to keep the price of this watch so low. Two chips, two OSs, and the effort that goes into that seem expensive, and it’s really not lacking anything too drastic. I think it’s competitive in many good ways at 300 bucks. \n",
      "\n",
      "The clear positives include a nice design, a classy look, a high-quality display, dual-frequency GPS for better accuracy, and impressive battery life. The four days we talked about is awesome, but if you activate power saver mode, it can last up to 12 days, although that disables a lot of Wear OS features—just basic tasks like exercises and heart rate monitoring. You could still make it last a week if you wanted to. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the weaknesses are the delay in checking notifications, the not-so-great haptics, and the lack of iPhone compatibility, which you already knew. I’d also add that the charger is not that impressive. It’s kind of clunky—a big plastic block with pins and magnets—but it charges perfectly fine. You can get a full day’s charge in 10 minutes and a complete charge in an hour. That's acceptable. \n",
      "\n",
      "For $300, I’d say OnePlus has redeemed itself in its smartwatch efforts. It’s pretty good. In a world of smartwatch gimmicks—there's the one with earbuds inside, the one focused on fitness, the one designed for iPhone—maybe this is the one with the hybrid system and solid battery life. \n",

If you’re looking for a reason to feel like you’re not getting ripped off, the hardware packaging achieves that. The pin is solid, made of aluminum, and feels dense. There are three colors available: matte black, which is the cheapest option, or for an additional hundred dollars, you can choose white or this black and silver model that I’m using. There’s a lot of technology packed into this device, including a camera, microphones, lights, and a tiny class 2 laser projector. The magnets that secure everything together are also super strong. \n",

Additionally, it comes with a well-made and highly reflective charging case, as well as a desktop charging puck where you can magnetize either the battery or the entire pin at once.

      "Now, let’s try to forget about your smartphone for just a moment. This little pin can do a lot and is quite helpful. Think of it as an AI assistant that's right by your side all the time. You can ask it questions without a wake word since it activates the microphone when you touch it.\n",

There are three pictures of dogs on the wall behind you. There is a window to the left of the camera. There is a boom mic on the table in front of you. There is a red carpet on the floor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera can also take pictures and up to 15-second videos, which automatically upload while charging. It can remember things you tell it to and all of this information is accessible through the Humane Center—a web portal for everything connected to the pin. There is no app; it's just a website. Here, you can view a complete history of calls, texts, and what you’ve engaged with, along with items you've asked it to remember. \n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the most impressive feature is the translation function. By using a two-finger gesture, you can say something in another language, and it will auto-detect and translate back. For instance:\n",

You hold your hand flat, and the UI projects a green 720p mini-screen onto your hand. Interaction involves certain gestures, like rolling your hand to select an item or pinching to confirm. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is definitely a new concept, and while it might require some practice, it's fairly intuitive. For unlocking, you’ll even move your hand through space to select numbers, which feels almost magical the first time you try it.

It’s supposed to answer questions, which it can do at times, but one major issue is that it's often slow because most requests go to the cloud. There can be a long wait for responses. Moreover, the AI can frequently be incorrect; it can hallucinate or misunderstand information, leading to erroneous answers. This is compounded by server timeouts, especially if your internet connection is poor, which often happens in my studio. \n",

      "\n",
      "I’ve had the pin drain an entire booster battery in just two hours while barely using it, while on other occasions, it lasted around four hours with extensive use. It's also constantly warm, which is concerning. At various times, I’ve experienced overheating, being prompted to wait for it to cool down. \n",
      "\n",
      "I suspect this heat issue arises from the gap created by the cloth between the booster and the pin. While the engineering is impressive, wireless charging tends to be inefficient and generates heat, and this device is no exception. Consequently, it creates a constant, somewhat uncomfortable sensation of wear on my chest alongside its weight. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its high-quality build and impressive hardware, it does weigh a little too much. I would prefer using lighter materials since the pin starts pulling down when adorned with lighter fabric, especially in warm weather. They do offer optional lighter accessories, but you never really forget that you’re wearing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AI Pin also cannot set a timer or an alarm. The notification light, positioned in the corner, functions but is often out of my peripheral vision, making it easy to miss. Additionally, since it’s designed to be pinned on one side of the body, that area often faces issues in real-world situations like seat belts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The photos it takes are subpar, the videos are even worse, limited to a square ratio, and very noisy, maxing out at just 15 seconds. The central hub where everything syncs with can abruptly stop functioning, requiring a refresh to get it back. \n",

Throughout my week of using this pin, I’ve been reminded that smartphones aren’t going away anytime soon. Many online comments mirror this sentiment even without testing the device, noting the considerable overlap between what the pin does and what modern smartphones achieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything this pin accomplishes, your smartphone can do better, faster, easier, and at higher quality. Smartphones take better photos and videos, allow for easier communication, and work in various environments. For quick queries, you can just Google answers faster from your phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, if I ask the AI Pin to send someone a picture, it takes the photo, but then needs to either use voice commands or a gesture to show the picture, which appears as a low-quality green JPEG on your hand. Sending it then requires additional steps and results in just a link to view the image in the Humane web portal. \n",
      "\n",
      "The users enjoy an extremely streamlined experience on smartphones, and I would often find myself in situations where I waited for a response from the pin while my phone sat right beside me, ready for instant answers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, while I appreciate the concept of talking to a virtual assistant, it must have insight into your preferences and schedule to be effective. Your smartphone has all that knowledge, while this standalone device isn’t connected at all. That leaves this pin operating at a severe disadvantage in terms of usefulness. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can immerse yourself completely and try to teach it everything about you, but ultimately, it won’t generate relevant recommendations or reminders seamlessly. Much like sending texts or making calls, it cannot see the entire conversation history on the device. There will always be a gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "This leads us back to the essential question: why didn’t they make this connect to your phone? I believe Humane aims for this product to evolve into a powerful standalone device in the future. However, to achieve that, they cannot establish a precedent of connectivity to smartphones, as it would imply removing this feature down the road.\n",

At one point, I considered calling it, “This product is either the dumbest thing ever, or I’m just an idiot.” It’s undeniably flawed right now but occasionally, and I mean very occasionally, the AI Pin would perform its function seamlessly, offering a glimpse into what it could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, I’ve often noted the best ideas come when I'm unable to write them down—like when I’m about to sleep, showering, or driving. So, one day while driving to the studio, an idea struck me, and instead of pulling out my phone, I opted to use the pin:\n",

      "Additionally, the ability to capture unique first-person videos while driving is quite intriguing. Even though the quality isn’t stellar, the convenience of doing so without distraction is appealing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you ask who should buy this device right now, the honest answer is nobody should. However, if there’s one type of user who might consider it, it’s someone looking to minimize screen time and reduce reliance on their phone. Occasionally, I relate to that sentiment and prefer avoiding doom-scrolling in my downtime. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, with this device, the added friction and annoyance often deter you from that ideal of reduced screen time and purposeful living. For example, while traveling recently, I woke up dreading the idea of dealing with the pin. \n",

      "Ultimately, you should probably skip this product too, especially when considering future promises of updates. Admittedly, this is a product with a long way to go, and I respect the attempt to innovate. It’s not often we see something truly groundbreaking. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is significant improvement needed, and while they have shared a roadmap for improvements, the lack of timeline leaves uncertainty. \n",

      "Welcome to your first look at the Samsung Galaxy S24 Series. I think these devices are much more interesting than they appear at first glance. Today, we're introducing three new phones: the Galaxy S24, S24+, and S24 Ultra. While they may look quite similar to the S23 lineup—especially in terms of design—things become more intriguing once you delve into the software and Samsung's AI features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the physical changes, which aren't many. The S24 and S24+ maintain the same dimensions, body sizes, camera rings, and button placements as last year's models. The main difference lies in the new color options: black, gray, violet, and yellow—all in matte finishes instead of glossy, which I wasn't expecting but actually prefer. The design is also squared off, resembling the iPhone closely. I understand that comparisons are common, but the flat sides and screen do evoke an iPhone-like appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bezels on the S24 and S24+ are slightly thinner, allowing for slightly larger displays: 6.2 inches for the S24 and 6.7 inches for the S24+. The screens themselves are significant upgrades, especially the larger display. Both panels now boast a brightness level of 2,600 nits, and the S24+ has been upgraded from 1080p to Quad HD. You can even use it at 120 Hz while in Quad HD mode, similar to the Ultra. That's a commendable upgrade they didn't have to include, and I'm grateful for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, each device now features slightly larger batteries, with the S24 having a 4,000 milliamp-hour battery and the S24+ at 4,900 milliamp-hours. The S24 Ultra has also been tweaked; it appears similar but is slightly thinner, with side rails now made of titanium instead of aluminum. The front display is completely flat from corner to corner, a design I appreciate. We’ve seen the evolution from dramatically curved edges in older Ultra and Note phones to this flatter design with minimal bezels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ultra comes in matte finishes with new colors, including black, a new titanium shade, violet, and yellow. Under the hood, all models are powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. The cameras on the S24 and S24+ are mostly similar to last year’s versions, but the S24 Ultra has seen some changes. It still features the 200-megapixel main camera, but the telephoto options now consist of a 3x and a redesigned 5x lens. This shift makes sense, as not many users typically zoom up to 10x. The new 5x lens is 50 megapixels, which should maintain quality even when cropping into the middle 50% of the frame for a 10x result, a theory I'll be testing during my full review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the camera setup across the board seems familiar, and the Ultra retains its 5,000 milliamp-hour battery with the S-Pen housed on the side. For a detailed overview of the specifications and prices, we’ve created a handy chart; I do wish the S24 started at 256 gigs of storage, but that's a minor downside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's dive into the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. This latest flagship chip signifies the beginning of a new life cycle in smartphones, with many devices launching featuring this chip. I'll be examining aspects like performance, battery life, and heat management, but it's evident that Qualcomm has integrated various AI processing features into this chip. Manufacturers now have the opportunity to capitalize on these features.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the standout AI features is the instant visual search. By holding down the home button (or gesture bar), you can circle something on your screen to instantly Google it. This functionality isn't entirely new, as we've seen Reverse Image Search and Google Lens for years. However, the convenience of long-pressing images on a website or in your gallery to search for information is fantastic and has the potential for heavy use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the voice recorder app now utilizes AI for enhanced speaker labeling and transcription, as well as summarizing recordings into bullet points. The Notes app has also received AI improvements, allowing for handwriting adjustments and note summarization, adding even more functionality to the already impressive Ultra, which elevates note-taking beyond just a tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the phone app, if you have a conversation with someone who speaks a different language, it can provide live transcription and translation in real-time. By downloading language packs, the phone can perform offline transcription. This means you can have a smooth conversation where you speak your language and hear the other person’s responses translated into your own language, which I find quite impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The photo app also has undergone AI enhancements. You can now do simple edits like adding background blur or removing objects from images, showcasing a clever automatic adjustment of colors and lighting. In the photo editor, the reintroduction of AI features allows users to circle elements in images for manipulation, similar to tools found in other apps, yet Samsung seems to have fewer restrictions on what you can edit. There are even features that enable regular videos to be transformed into slow motion by generating new frames.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, Bixby remains present but has not shown significant advancements in this iteration. I plan to conduct thorough tests on the phone's screens, camera functionality, and to uncover any hidden features that may have been overlooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those looking to customize their devices, I spoke with our channel sponsor, dbrand, and they have ready-to-go Grip Cases available, which will ship around the same time as the phones. What I appreciate about the Grip Case is that it offers precise camera cutouts rather than generic designs, and this year they’ve also added MagSafe compatibility for the S24 series.\n",

      "Hey, what’s up? MKBHD here. This little machine that I can hold in my hands has more CPU power than a base Mac Pro right now. I hope that won’t be true for much longer, as the Mac Pro is overdue for its Apple Silicon upgrade. But the fact that it's true at all right now is absolutely insane.\n",
      "\n",
      "This little machine is not only super powerful, efficient, and small, but it also comes at a really good price. In my previous video about the MacBook Pros, I mentioned that the Mac mini is actually the more interesting machine, and I genuinely believe that. It has just been refreshed from the M1 chip to now include the M2 and M2 Pro options, both of which are game changers in their own ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the M2 version, the base M2 Mac mini is a game changer because it includes all the benefits of the new Apple Silicon — the second-generation, five-nanometer process and blazing fast shared memory — all for a starting price of $599 in the US. It’s a straightforward computer, not even a small tower — just an incredibly tiny machine. It’s essentially a laptop without the screen and keyboard, available only in silver, and features a decent array of ports on the back, along with a small exhaust vent for active cooling and a headphone jack.\n",
      "\n",
      "This computer packs an enormous amount of power for its size. We’ve seen the Apple Silicon transition unfold over the past two years, and when the Mac mini transitioned from Intel chips to Apple Silicon, it experienced an incredible leap in performance. Some of the numbers on paper are just ridiculous. You have to forgive me for using Apple's unlabeled charts, but it's important to illustrate how this has completely changed the nature of the product. The M1 Mac mini was already dramatically better than the Intel version for 99% of users, and now the M2 comes along with more cores, a more powerful CPU and GPU, increased maximum memory, and a higher overall performance ceiling. Plus, the price goes down from $699 to $599. Apple almost never lowers entry-level prices, but that's exactly what’s happened here.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we now have a computer that's more powerful, more capable, and more efficient — all for less money. Additionally, there's the M2 Pro Mac mini, which I've been testing and using. Previously, we only had the base Apple Silicon M1 Mac mini; now, with the M2, we also have this Pro chip that raises the performance ceiling for the Mac mini while maintaining the same tiny body. Well, I should clarify that the M2 Pro version adds two more Thunderbolt ports, so now it has four Thunderbolt 4 ports on the back, along with everything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means you can now connect three external displays instead of two, and you can also option up to 10 gigabit ethernet if you have that type of internet connection, or if you work in an institution that can utilize that kind of networking capability. Yes, it does support HDMI 2.1 as well. The real highlight of this new chip, the M2 Pro, is that it's benchmarked even higher than the M1 Pro and M1 Max in the CPU department, which were the highest-end configurations in previous MacBook Pros. I had to do a double-take when I first saw this since the M1 Max has been phenomenal, but here we are; even the incremental improvements here are noteworthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the thermal advantages of a Mac mini with active cooling in a taller chassis versus a MacBook Pro means you might see even better sustained CPU performance over time. This Mac mini’s performance is solid. As you move up from the base chip to the Pro to the Max, the improvements are mostly in GPU performance. The M2 Pro does well here, too, but the results tend to align more closely — it's an improvement over the previous generation, of course, but for applications that specifically take advantage of GPU performance, the Max chips are still the better choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, everyday performance will remain excellent. The sustained multi-core performance ceiling is significantly higher, especially for tasks like video editing or app development, which involve longer compile or render times. That’s where the M2 Pro excels. This model starts at $1,299, which isn’t cheap, but when you consider that the M2 Pro MacBook Pro, with the exact same system on a chip, starts at $1,999, it becomes a much more appealing option.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the main reason I’m calling these Mac minis a game changer: their performance per dollar. You typically don’t expect that from a Mac, but if I were to create one of those charts showing performance per dollar, you would see that the Mac mini offers the same performance for less money — the line would be higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "For so long, Apple has prioritized laptops, which is understandable as they’ve been very successful and popular. However, some people buy a laptop and end up keeping it in one room all the time because desktop options aren’t as appealing. If we're being honest, the iMac is cool, but it’s not for everyone. Right now, it feels like Apple has low-key forgotten about the iMac. It’s still sitting with the unupgraded M1 chip, even though the M2 is available. They introduced the Mac Studio, which is excellent, especially in the higher-end configurations, and I can't wait to see the M2 Ultra, but the Mac mini now fits nicely underneath all of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the modularity of a desktop, you can choose whatever display you want instead of being tied to a built-in monitor. It’s funny; in recent reviews, I've been trying to touch on sustainability where it’s relevant. There are some neat aspects with this machine, like its recycled aluminum and plastics, but all of that still pales in comparison to the flexibility of continuing to use your existing display and swapping out displays as you wish — unlike the iMac. \n",
      "\n",
      "Call me crazy, but I think many people may not want to be stuck with a non-upgradable display, webcam, and white bezels forever. Plus, if you already have a display you like, you can simply continue using that. I haven’t covered the Mac mini since the “Fastest Mac Mini in the World” project I did back in college. Shout out to those who subscribed back then! I took the highest-end Mac mini available in 2012 and maxed it out, upgrading to the fastest RAM and SSD it would support to create the most capable tiny machine for a college dorm room with limited space. Clearly, my priorities back then were video editing over homework.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the M2 Pro Mac mini has all the power that I would have killed for back then as a budding creator with limited space, and it costs less. I had to look back and remember that I spent $1,759 for the fastest Mac mini back in the day. This one exceeds it in terms of performance and capability. Of course, the trade-off here is that none of the tightly integrated parts are upgradable, so you need to think about spending a bit more to account for the long-term ownership without the option to upgrade. You might want to consider getting a little extra RAM or storage, depending on your use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Mac mini can handle just about any footage you throw at it. And by the way, if you’re a student like I was back then, don’t forget about the student discount — that typically gives you a hundred bucks off. So with these machines, it brings the base M2 down to $499, which is fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, if you're considering which Mac to buy right now, think of it this way: If you already have an Apple Silicon Mac like the M1 generation, you're good. There’s no need to buy a new Mac every year; those machines were a great upgrade over Intel. If you have an older Mac and are genuinely looking to upgrade, I’d recommend starting with the base M2 Mac mini at $599. I wouldn’t buy the iMac right now since it still has the M1 and costs $1,299 for a non-removable 24-inch display. Instead, go for the Mac mini and pair it with a display of your choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you know you need a portable solution, the laptops are impressive. You can get an M2-generation MacBook Pro, and they are excellent, which I just reviewed. If you're looking for a discount, an M1-generation MacBook Pro is also a good option right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "With each lineup, remember the big difference between M2, M2 Pro, M2 Max, and eventually M2 Ultra, is GPU performance. So, it shouldn’t be a surprise that they’re similar in CPU performance. If your applications take advantage of the GPU, that's when you should consider upgrading.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s pretty much it. It might be a little surprising, but for price and performance, the Mac mini is a huge winner. The Mac mini might make me miss removable memory, but it certainly makes most high-end media machines feel pretty average. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.\n",

The back part that touches your wrist has a matte finish and includes engravings in a minimalist font—model number and the company's headquarters in Cheapside, London, which is quite fitting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, it doesn’t look or feel terrible, but you can clearly see the shortcuts typical of a cheaper product. The bezels are thick and uneven, there’s no rotating dial, just a cheap-feeling button above a tinny speaker, and it charges with a basic USB-A to dual-pin cable, not a fancy puck. While the magnetic back is convenient, it lacks elegance.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, everything works well enough. It reaches up to 600 nits of brightness, though there’s no auto-brightness feature, so you’ll need to adjust it manually. At its maximum brightness, it performs well indoors. Plus, it has an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance, which is great for exercise or rain. Interestingly, there was a time when OnePlus and Nothing products didn’t have IP certification due to added costs, but now the CMF watch does.\n",
      "\n",
      "The watch syncs with the CMF Watch app on your phone via Bluetooth. If you’ve used a smartwatch before, the UI will be familiar. Your watch face is your starting point, and you can swipe through fitness data that resembles Apple Watch rings. You can view heart rate history for the past 24 hours, check the weather in a dot matrix format, and track sleep time if you use that feature. A single press of that plastic button takes you to a list of apps, which is available in either grid or list format.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a considerable number of pre-installed apps, including an exercise app with a variety of workouts, a blood oxygen measurement app, a phone call app (you can receive calls on the watch), and a music app for controlling playback on your phone. There's even a camera remote app. While it doesn't open your phone's camera app or show a live view, the shutter button works when the camera app is open. \n",
      "\n",
      "The voice assistant app opens Google Assistant on your phone, utilizing the watch's mics and speakers for interaction. The \"Find My Phone\" app is amusing; it only works when the CMF app is open on your phone. If the app isn’t open, it just prompts you to open it— frustrating if you've misplaced your phone. However, once opened, it plays a max volume ringtone to help you locate your phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The watch's UI operates smoothly without much lag when switching between apps, likely because they are lightweight. This device mainly acts as a Bluetooth accessory, transmitting simple controls to your phone. It offers a nice variety of watch faces, with one featuring an orange theme and a moving second hand being my favorite. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also very lightweight. While some may not prioritize lightness in watches, in this price range, they are mostly plastic. So, it's a plus that this watch is super light, making it comfortable for sports or daily activities. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Bluetooth accessory, it can work with almost any Android phone. The Play Store app has a 3.1-star rating and has occasionally presented connection issues for me. However, its compatibility with various Android devices is better than what Apple offers for their smartwatch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm able to track sleep since it only requires heart rate sensors, and I also get data from my mattress cover with built-in sensors. I'm sure you've heard of Eight Sleep's Pod Mattress Cover, which adjusts the bed temperature automatically and monitors your sleep. Their app provides personalized reports daily, covering heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep stages. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m officially done using wearables for sleep tracking, as the mattress cover covers all my needs. Eight Sleep has listened to feedback and offers a free Sleep Report every six months, regardless of membership level, which is not behind a paywall. Thanks to Eight Sleep for sponsoring this video; they are offering the largest discount they've ever had. If you want to check it out, use the link in the description and code MKBHD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that I’m not wearing the CMF Watch while sleeping, I can charge it each night. The magnetic pin charger isn’t as pretty as a wireless charging puck, but it’s very effective. I’ve found the battery life to be excellent due to its simple design. The website claims about 13 days of regular use, and while I may not reach that, I easily got three straight days without issue. Using Power Saver mode could extend that even further. It has better battery life than an Apple Watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I’ve realized is that this smartwatch is actually on the pricier side for basic smartwatches, at $69. The cheapest options are often in the $20 to $50 range, which generally offer similar functionality. In comparison, the CMF Watch Pro offers better packaging, design, and appearance, for a slight markup—similar to how Nothing positions its products with appealing design.\n",
      "\n",
      "CMF stands for color, material, finish—a nod to both the company name and the design philosophy. This smartwatch is silver-ish, somewhat fingerprint-prone, with a metallic appearance that feels plastic-like. If you squint hard enough, it vaguely resembles an Apple Watch Ultra. If that’s your comparison, then it’s a total bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you’re interested, it's worth exploring, although it may be a bit challenging to find in the U.S. Importing it could incur extra costs, but it’s an option. Now you know it exists! Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace!\n",

      "(logo whooshes)  \n",
      "So I don’t think the Vision Pro is going to be an every single year product update, like the iPhone. I think it's going to be one of those kinds of products that comes out every couple of years. You stack up enough tech updates every once in a while, and then it’s worthy of a new generation. It’s a bigger deal when it comes out. And by the way, that’s how a lot of other VR headsets have been. The Quest 3 came out three years after the Quest 2, and the PS VR 2 came out six years after the first one. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, in a sense, these are already very early thoughts, but it’s been out for a little bit, and we’re really starting to get a sense of where people are using it and how they’re getting the most value out of it. Let me tell you, a lot of people are still not convinced about the whole VR or Vision Pro thing at all. It’s an interesting product for sure, but it just doesn’t do much. I started having those thoughts immediately as soon as I began testing this thing—just all sorts of missing features that I would like it to have. \n",
      "\n",
      "So here are those thoughts all in one place. Probably the biggest thing that you’ve noticed, if you’ve been familiar with the VR headset world or used any other VR headset before, is that the Vision Pro is missing shared experiences. With it, you are always alone in this headset. There are lots of great, super immersive experiences, and you can be productive and watch a movie, but no matter what's happening, you're always alone. Even if you have pass-through on, nobody else can see what you see. So it's basically impossible to share what you’re experiencing without mirroring everything on an iPad or something like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, FaceTime is close. It’s one thing, but I’m talking about sharing one virtual space with more than one person, or seeing the same virtual environment at the same time with multiple people, or seeing the same virtual object from two different perspectives at the same time. You ever play \"Rec Room\"? It’s one of the oldest but most fun games on the Meta Quest. It’s just so simple. You’re out there having fun, running around a room, or in different game areas where you can jump into an experience and play a game together. \n",
      "\n",
      "In that digital space, you can look around and see other people—well, I use \"people\" with air quotes—but you see them, they see you, and you can explore the same environment from different angles at the same time. It doesn’t even have to be super realistic or high resolution to convince you that it’s another reality, but it’s way more social and interactive and fun that way. On the Apple Vision Pro, aside from FaceTime, really, all of the other experiences are just you in there solo. There’s no one else in there. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, no matter what you’re doing, no matter how immersive the movie is or how good the game is around you, you’re in there by yourself, and nobody else can see what you’re seeing. Here’s a basic example: How cool would it be if you and the person next to you on a plane could sync up your experiences and both watch the same movie in a virtual theater at the same time? Simple as that. Or, maybe if you were manipulating a 3D object in space, wouldn’t it make a ton of sense for someone else to be able to share that object with you so they can see how you’re manipulating it? It just feels like it makes too much sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told you guys about that Sky Guide app, which shows you the stars and constellations in the sky. It’s pretty awesome. Funny enough, there's a laser pointer feature that lets you point at the sky and circle around and point at things. But still, nobody can see what you’re pointing at with the laser, even if they have a Vision Pro. \n",
      "\n",
      "So there are two basic types of shared experiences that it would be great for Apple to add to this device. The first is if two different people with Vision Pros are in the same room with pass-through on, one of them could drop a virtual object into that room, and the other can see and manipulate it at the same time. Great. The second is when two different people with Vision Pros are in different locations, halfway across the world, it doesn’t matter. They both turn on or join the same virtual environment and can see it at the same time. \n",
      "\n",
      "As of right now, I believe the first type is harder because of how these headsets work with the pass-through. They are basically in real time mapping the volume of space around you with the sensors on the front—mapping surfaces, walls, floors, and objects around you. That’s how Vision OS locks your apps floating in 3D space and casts shadows on different surfaces in your room with decent accuracy. But there’s no guarantee that if you’re in a room with someone else who also has a headset on, both your headsets are mapping the room in the exact same way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I place an object into space, but your headset doesn’t see that space, so it gets confused, or it doesn’t map my hands or what I’m manipulating in precisely the same way. It’s not guaranteed to be the same. The other kind, sharing a virtual environment that someone builds with anyone anywhere in the world, seems like a no-brainer. Like, being able to watch a movie in a virtual movie theater with someone else who gets a seat in that theater or playing a multiplayer game in the same environment—this stuff is pretty basic with VR. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love playing multiplayer table tennis in the Quest. It’s one of my favorite shared VR experiences. You can play against people anywhere else in the world. There are all kinds of other multiplayer games like this in VR. That is a huge part of the VR gaming experience, and I just wonder why this doesn’t have that yet. It seems like a significant oversight, especially since Apple has built massive, high-resolution environments, but you can only move a little bit before you’re out of the play zone. It’s fascinating. I wonder if that’s related to how Apple thinks about these environments. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, I know that’s the number one missing feature on the Vision Pro that I’d love to see in a second generation. Now, the other big one that stands out to me is, if I want to use the Vision Pro a lot in multiple locations—home and work—I wish it had a memory of all the windows and apps I leave open in each place. \n",
      "\n",
      "See, the Vision Pro is already amazing in one space. It’s seriously incredible. Windows stay locked to where you leave them as the device live maps your space. You can pin something to a wall, then walk around and pin something to another wall or right in the middle of the room. Leave the room, come back, and they’re still there. I even tried this: I pinned a window between two cars in a parking lot, turned, and walked away. I went inside, walked down a long hallway, totally out of sight, around another corner into the studio—and sure enough, that window is still right where I left it between those spaces in the parking lot. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing holding it back from being nearly perfect is occlusion. Basically, the only thing that gets between the window and you is your own arms and hands, which is usually fine. But if you have something positioned around a corner, it doesn’t put the wall in between you and the window, which is where it should be. Sometimes it gets a little wonky, but overall, it’s a 9 out of 10—already really cool. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the second it gets dinged is when you want to do this in more than one space. So, let's say at home, I've set up all these virtual monitors, with a virtual TV in one room and some windows on the walls. I pack it up, drive to the studio, and put it on. The second I start opening apps here, they have to disappear from home. They basically disappear from any other space and open in your new space. So, there’s no memory of different older spaces, so when I go back home, my windows are all gone, and I’ll have to set them up again one by one. Not a huge deal, but if it had memory, wouldn’t that make sense? \n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if you could set up little beacons. All it probably needs is a QR code or some visual identifier. You get home, put the headset on, and it sees the beacon and goes, “Oh, I’m at home,” then puts all your windows back where you usually have them for work. Basically, you kick back on the couch, put the headset on, and you don’t have to re-set up each window in all the same places every time. It would just remember that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Those two features alone would dramatically update how often I would realistically use the Vision Pro. I don’t know if that requires a Vision OS software update or if you need more computational power for shared spaces, but those are the significant things I think are missing that would be awesome. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the rest of the stuff on my list is maybe a little more icing on the cake. For example, I think probably 99.99% of people who buy a Vision Pro have an iPhone. I think that’s pretty safe. It might be a hundred percent, but I think that’s reasonable. I found it interesting that a lot of people assume it’ll just connect to the iPhone, thinking they'll see their phone notifications straight away on the Vision Pro, but it's not. It’s a separate device, like a Mac or an iPad. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, yeah, it will show you iMessage notifications, but it is a separate device. Unlike a Mac or iPad, when you put on a headset, you’re automatically wearing it. So if I get a phone call on my iPhone, I can’t necessarily even see that I’m getting a call. There is no notification for it in the Vision Pro, and I have to take the headset off to see it and accept the call. So, it would be nice to have an option where these two devices communicated a bit better—maybe a little hub for smartphone notifications if I want to check them. I think it makes sense. They probably won’t do that though. \n",
      "\n",
      "But here’s a number for you: 3,386. That is the pixel density of the Vision Pro’s displays. It’s a pretty ridiculous number—over 3,000 pixels per inch each. There have been some teardowns; I’ll link those below. You can see the displays up close—they’re incredibly sharp. So that, along with the high refresh rate and minimal distortion, contributes to the pass-through feeling very real. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the number I’d like to improve is 92. The Vision Pro’s displays show 92% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. That’s pretty good coverage for a display, honestly. The reference-grade display, like the Pro Display XDR, will show you 99% of DCI-P3. So again, it’s great for a display, but the thing about a VR headset is it’s replacing your eyes. The pass-through is decent for what it is, but without getting too complicated, 100% coverage of DCI-P3 represents about 50% coverage of all the colors the human eye can see. \n",
      "\n",
      "So this headset looks great and is very sharp, but it’s only showing me a little less than half of the colors of reality. I wonder how much they can improve that because the human eye is obviously capable of incredible dynamic range and sharpness. Apple has a long-standing reputation for great displays, and these are no exception, but a wider field of view and more color depth would be interesting. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are also a lot of other little things that are obvious, like weight reduction—of course. Higher quality screen recording is a niche request of mine, but I think it would help a lot for people trying to create videos with these things. Additionally, even more specific, keyboard pass-through while in an environment would be great. So you’re in an environment typing on a virtual Mac display, and if it can recognize my hands after a scan, I think it would be nice to have a feature that scans your keyboard or recognizes the keyboard of your MacBook. After all, it’s going to look the same every time, just like my hands. \n",
      "\n",
      "All that being said, I’m sure there are more things on other people's lists. Let me know what you think about the Apple Vision Pro gen two. Maybe leave your wishlist in the comments below. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys on the next one. Peace.  \n",

      "All right, so this is the iPhone 15 lineup: the iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max. We have new colors, new materials, and new ports. There's some exciting stuff to unbox here, so let’s get started.\n",
      "\n",
      "First up, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. The iPhone 15 here is in the new blue color, which I’m going to rename “barely blue.” I think that’s an appropriate name because it really only gives hints of blue. You can see it more on the side rails. Overall, the colors this year are very subtle. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the box, we find the usual paperwork, a single white Apple sticker, and no SIM card ejector tool since they have all switched to eSIM in the US now. Most importantly, the new cable included with the iPhone is a single white braided USB-C to USB-C cable. This is the first time the iPhone is shipping with a nice braided cable like this, so hopefully it’ll be more durable than the old cables we've received for years. So, cool—USB-C cable, USB-C phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at the Plus model, the concept is the same: a larger box, but this time in an incredibly pale yellow. In perfect lighting at the Apple event, it looked a bit more colorful, but in regular light, it appears very washed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we have the Pro boxes for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. They still feature white boxes but with dark wallpapers. The iPhone 15 Pro here is in a new dark blue color—again, I'd almost rename this one “barely blue” too, but this time it’s darker and has a grayish tone depending on the light. It feels very safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the Pro box, you again have the paperwork, the white Apple sticker, and the braided USB-C cable. And our iPhone 15 Pro Max here is in the new Natural Titanium color. I have to say, I think this will be the most popular color; it really stands out when you have it in hand. I’ll explain more about why a bit later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, by the time you see this, I’ve been testing these phones for about six days now. That’s not quite enough time for a full review per my standards, but I do have some thoughts and observations, plus a few quirks.\n",
      "\n",
      "First up, the pale colors. This might be fine for some, but I’ve often been told that everyone will put a case on their phone—which is probably true. However, Apple did spend a lot of time and effort developing this new softer-touch satin finish on the back, and some of us carry our phones without a case, so it’s worth mentioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Pro models, there’s an added layer of interest. Apple has switched the rail material from shiny stainless steel to brushed titanium. It’s approximately 10% lighter, which is noticeable and enjoyable. However, I thought the brushed finish would minimize fingerprints on the sides. I was wrong. It’s less bad than stainless steel but still noticeable, especially on the darker colors like black or blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, this material isn’t anodized as aluminum might be; it features a new PVD coating. While I’m not sure how well this will hold up over time, I do know that if you get a scratch deep enough, it'll reveal the lighter Natural Titanium color beneath, which could look unappealing if you drop the phone and get a large gash on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I really think the Natural Titanium or the lighter colors will be the better options for the Pro models this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, some specific observations from my first week. On the Pro, the bezels are slightly thinner, which makes the body a bit smaller, but the difference isn’t very noticeable. What is noticeable is the softer curves around these phones, especially on the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro. Last year’s iPhones had very square edges, but the new models have a subtle curve into the rails, which makes them more comfortable to hold while still looking boxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "With USB-C on these phones, we already know you can just plug in a cable to charge accessories. While there’s no reverse wireless charging, you can connect a USB-C cable to charge AirPods, an Apple Watch MagSafe charger, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "I explored some of the behaviors related to plugging things into the iPhone 15s. If you connect an older Lightning iPhone to a USB-C iPhone, the USB-C iPhone will always provide battery to the Lightning iPhone, regardless of charge state. However, if you connect another USB-C iPhone, they do a handshake to determine which has a lower battery. The one with the higher charge will act as a battery bank to charge the one with the lower charge until you unplug them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also tested a couple of Android phones to see if a similar handshake occurred. If you plug into an Android phone with more battery that supports USB Power Delivery (PD), it will function as a battery bank. If the other phone doesn’t support USB PD, it can be inconsistent, with either phone potentially charging the other. But if it does support USB PD, it will perform the same handshake as the iPhones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The output is limited to 4.5 watts, so it’s not fast charging but good for accessories. You can use the cable in the box to charge new AirPods or other devices, or even rescue another smartphone if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s talk about the new Action button on the Pro models. I was curious about its functionality and if there were any limitations, but so far, I haven't found any. It essentially allows you to program it however you like, which I’m really pleased about. This feature has appeared on some Android phones in the past, and I hope it becomes more common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jumping into the settings, you’ll find the Action button option, which has a unique UI distinct from the usual settings pages on the iPhone. By default, it replaces the mute switch and offers two different haptic feedback patterns, so you know if it’s muted without having to look.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also set it to open the camera in any mode, but since the camera is already accessible on the lock screen, it seems redundant. The same goes for the flashlight function. However, I do like the voice memo trigger, as it immediately starts recording when you press and hold the button.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite function by far is the Siri Shortcuts capability, which allows for customization. You can stack different functions based on your location or have it call a specific contact, or simply open any app on your phone without delay. For me, I’m mapping the Action button to Google Assistant—the best assistant available on the iPhone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also curious about how cases would work with this new Action button, so I asked dbrand, one of our sponsors, to send over their new Ghost case. I think it looks great, and I can confirm that the Action button remains just as responsive and clicky, even with the case on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the clear case, dbrand has designed the Ghost case to resist yellowing—a common issue with clear cases—which is why they offer a lifetime replacement guarantee if it ever yellows. That’s either a strong commitment or a way to offer free cases for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I’ve been taking pictures and videos with the new cameras to assess their performance. I plan to post plenty on Twitter and Instagram. I will also shoot the next Auto Focus car channel video with this phone, so be sure to subscribe to see the quality in action.\n",
      "\n",
      "They mentioned a new coating over the lenses during the keynote, and I was hopeful it would improve the nighttime flare issues in iPhone videos. However, after testing it in a dark room, it seems the coating didn't solve this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I want to clarify the new camera behavior on the Pro models. Initially, I was skeptical about the 1x versus 1.2x versus 1.5x options, thinking it was just a digital crop. However, it’s actually a set of Super Res Zoom presets that you can digitally zoom between.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some benchmark scores for the A17 Pro if you’re interested in performance metrics. Overall, I feel like the base iPhone 15 models bring more improvement than they seem to on paper. There’s nothing drastically new, but with features inherited from last year’s Pro models, they are solid devices. The Pro models offer genuinely new features and some updates, including slightly larger batteries.\n",
      "\n",

You can wear it while eating, sleeping, showering, swimming — whatever — it fits seamlessly into daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the most impressive aspect of the smart ring is how closely it mimics the dimensions of a regular ring, which is something some people would wear. Keep in mind that if you have smaller hands, it may appear larger. It’s 2.6 millimeters thick, so it does sit a bit bulky on your finger, but apart from that, it looks quite normal. I’m amazed at how much technology they’ve packed into this tiny frame. By technology, I mean a small battery and a few basic sensors. But when combined, you get an all-day activity tracker that you can put on at the start of the week and forget about, providing valuable insights into your health, sleep, and energy levels. At least, that’s the ideal usage scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I had never worn a ring before, there was a learning curve to get used to it being on my finger every day. Additionally, there are some best practices for wearing this particular ring. For instance, there is a correct way to wear it. All the sensors are aligned on one side of the ring at the bottom, marked by a little notch. You should position these sensors facing the palm side of your hand for the best readings, and it’s recommended to wear it on your index finger, not your ring finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you get this figured out, you should see all your data in the Samsung Health app, including calories burned, steps taken, and miles covered, all aggregated into one energy score out of 100. I was wearing my Apple Watch Ultra while testing the ring and noticed that the readings from the ring and the watch were significantly different. The ring seemed to be overcounting regular activity but underestimated the number of floors climbed. There was a substantial discrepancy in the numbers. At one point, I took off the ring around 10:00 PM, but it continued to show heart rate readings until 03:00 AM, when I definitely wasn't wearing it. That seemed a bit odd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, I conducted a challenge where I walked 1,000 steps using several smartwatches and a pedometer, and they were all within a few percent of each other in accuracy. So, I tend to trust the watch numbers over the ring’s. This brings me to the importance of sizing. With a ring, you only get one size, unlike a watch that can be adjusted.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may have seen the ring sizing kit from Samsung. You can buy it on their site for $10, and it includes a variety of different plastic versions of the ring that also have the sensor nubs. You try on different sizes to find one that is snug but won’t fall off. Once you find the right size, you get a $10 discount on the actual ring. \n",
      "\n",
      "I mention this because I mistakenly used the sizing kit incorrectly and ended up with a size 11, which was a little too big when I received the actual ring. It felt loose and uncomfortable, which resulted in gaps in my sleep readings — likely because the ring slipped off my finger while I was asleep and wasn’t able to track anything. I later got a size 10, which felt much better. Interestingly, wearing the ring on the index finger provides a better measurement for heart rate and other vital signs than the back of the wrist. This is a lesser-known fact about smartwatches — the back of the wrist isn't the optimal place for accurate readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here’s an insight that using this smart ring taught me about myself. All the benefits are still true: it's certainly more wearable than a watch 24/7, and its week-long battery life is legitimate. After a few days, you can almost forget you’re wearing it, and you don’t need to dress it up or down for different outfits. It features a simple concave titanium design available in three colors: gold, silver, or matte black. Personally, I find the matte black fits just right.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I’ve realized I’m not a big smart ring person. The primary activities that I care about most require me to have nothing on my hands. Ultimate Frisbee involves a lot of throwing and catching, while golf doesn’t work well with a ring either. Even weight training involves a lot of grip work where wearing a ring isn’t feasible. For those major activities, I take the ring off, which defeats the purpose of a fitness tracker that’s meant to monitor my workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did keep the ring on for some lighter plyometric workouts, and it offers automatic workout detection. However, for those lighter sessions where I’m not moving quickly or raising my heart rate significantly, the auto-detection didn't function very well for me. When it came to sleep tracking, there were instances where the ring indicated I didn’t go to sleep until midnight when I was actually in bed earlier than that. I discovered this because my smart mattress cover, the Eight Sleep, recorded everything accurately. \n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of which, this video is sponsored by Eight Sleep! I recently shared how their two-times-better cooling performance enhances my sleep quality, helping me reach more consistent high sleep scores. Plus, the autopilot feature adjusts temperature and elevation throughout the night, optimizing sleep conditions. Their Pod 4 technology is clinically validated to increase total sleep time by up to an hour and deep sleep by up to 2.5 hours a month, while also reducing wake-up time by up to three hours monthly. So, I genuinely enjoy it!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to check one out, visit EightSleep.com/mkbhd for $350 off a Pod 4 Ultra or $200 off a Pod 4. With that savings, you could almost buy a smart ring! But, back to my main point: if I’m taking the ring off during my most important workouts, then this clearly isn't a great fitness tracker for me. Even during lighter activities, my wrist device, which has a screen, allows me to start a workout and track specific periods, which is essential for monitoring my fitness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I like the idea of the ring, but it’s just not for me. It’s unfortunate because I appreciate its minimal design, with no notifications — it never vibrates or makes noise, and it doesn’t have a speaker. It serves as a subtle 24/7 wearable tech that you can wear for a week at a time, which is a brilliant concept. Samsung even designed a sleek case for charging the ring inductively from the inside, along with clever LEDs to indicate battery status for both the case and the ring itself. It can charge the ring up to 1.5 times with its built-in battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Galaxy Ring is not meant to replace a smartwatch; rather, it offers a different type of product within the same ecosystem. However, there is a limitation: it’s compatible only with Samsung Galaxy phones, not any Android devices. While I currently have a Samsung phone, should I change to a Pixel or another brand, I wouldn’t see why I wouldn’t just opt for an Oura ring or an Ultrahuman ring — both offer similar features and are compatible with any Android phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, this ring is geared towards individuals who already own a Samsung phone and prefer the wearability of a ring over the functionality of a smartwatch. A smartwatch is undeniably more functional but less wearable in some contexts. This ring emphasizes simplicity, which leads me to the one feature I wish it had: a tiny speaker or possibly an ultra-wideband antenna. Something that would make it easier to locate if lost. The ring is tough to find once misplaced — the app includes a Find My feature that shows the last GPS location when connected to your phone and can light up the internal LEDs for visibility in the darkness. However, if it’s hidden away in a pocket or underneath something, your chances of finding it are about as good as locating a regular ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, that’s the predicament I found myself in. My previous ring fell off at some point and I never managed to find it. So, Samsung, if you’re watching, apologies for that! I hope I can find it one day and return it to you. That’s my feature request along with fixing the issue of receiving inaccurate heart rate readings until 03:00 AM — still a bit creepy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, that's all for now. Thanks for watching! Let me know your thoughts, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace. \n",
