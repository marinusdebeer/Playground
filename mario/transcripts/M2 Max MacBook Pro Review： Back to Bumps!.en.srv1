with a press release</text><text start="33.45" dur="1.8">and an 18 minute YouTube video</text><text start="35.25" dur="2.34">that featured a bunch of
creators at the beginning,</text><text start="37.59" dur="4.076">which was cool, and then basically
a whole prerecorded event</text><text start="41.666" dur="2.704">that kind of looked like it
was cut out of another event.</text><text start="44.37" dur="1.17">Matter of fact, it&amp;#39;s rumored that</text><text start="45.54" dur="2.01">this basically was cut out of an event</text><text start="47.55" dur="2.52">that they were rumored
to have late last year.</text><text start="50.07" dur="0.87">Honestly, I buy it,</text><text start="50.94" dur="3.54">like the URL and the file name
of the video had 2022 in them</text><text start="54.48" dur="2.07">and the AR files for the new laptops</text><text start="56.55" dur="2.04">were compiled in October, 2022,</text><text start="58.59" dur="2.97">suggesting that these things
were ready to go months ago.</text><text start="61.56" dur="1.29">But whatever, none of that matters.</text><text start="62.85" dur="1.44">What matters is they&amp;#39;re here now</text><text start="64.29" dur="1.83">and what you need to
know is on the outside,</text><text start="66.12" dur="1.74">they&amp;#39;re basically identical,</text><text start="67.86" dur="3.57">but on the inside, instead
of M1 Pro and M1 Max,</text><text start="71.43" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s M2 Pro and M2 Max,</text><text start="74.91" dur="1.8">and a couple other tiny improvements also.</text><text start="76.71" dur="1.98">So the first Apple Silicon MacBook Pros,</text><text start="78.69" dur="1.92">when they came out in October, 2021,</text><text start="80.61" dur="3.63">honestly some of the most
unanimously well-liked computers</text><text start="84.24" dur="0.902">I have ever seen.</text><text start="85.142" dur="3.808">They added back the ports,
they got rid of the touch bar,</text><text start="88.95" dur="1.74">they brought back MagSafe,</text><text start="90.69" dur="0.833">they bumped up to</text><text start="91.523" dur="2.977">an excellent high refresh
rate mini LED display,</text><text start="94.5" dur="1.83">and the performance is incredible.</text><text start="96.33" dur="1.2">Like across the board,</text><text start="97.53" dur="1.86">I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve met a
single person who got one</text><text start="99.39" dur="3.39">and was like, &amp;quot;Oh, nah, I
made a mistake with this one.&amp;quot;</text><text start="102.78" dur="1.8">So when you see a new one
a year and a half later,</text><text start="104.58" dur="2.52">there isn&amp;#39;t really a ton that
we&amp;#39;re expecting to change</text><text start="107.1" dur="3.48">because the big leap was
from the Intel MacBook Pros</text><text start="110.58" dur="1.158">to the Apple Silicon ones.</text><text start="111.738" dur="2.832">Now we&amp;#39;re back to more
incremental improvements.</text><text start="114.57" dur="1.02">So as you can imagine,</text><text start="115.59" dur="2.37">yeah, completely identical on the outside,</text><text start="117.96" dur="2.01">same sizes, same colors,</text><text start="119.97" dur="2.07">the only way I can
differentiate this new one</text><text start="122.04" dur="2.271">from my old 16 inch M1 Max</text><text start="124.311" dur="2.739">is the icon skin I&amp;#39;ve had on the back.</text><text start="127.05" dur="1.38">Of course, channel sponsor dbrand</text><text start="128.43" dur="2.16">is already selling these
for the 2023 model,</text><text start="130.59" dur="2.85">so if you want your laptop
to look a little different</text><text start="133.44" dur="2.03">than every other MacBook Pro in the world,</text><text start="135.47" dur="2.8">then, yeah, this is your
best bet, link below.</text><text start="138.27" dur="0.99">So the bulk of what&amp;#39;s new</text><text start="139.26" dur="2.01">is coming from the new chip inside.</text><text start="141.27" dur="2.13">M2 Pro and M2 Max.</text><text start="143.4" dur="1.62">They are essentially the same price tiers</text><text start="145.02" dur="2.139">and configurations across
the board as before</text><text start="147.159" dur="4.821">but Apple is quoting now
20% more CPU performance</text><text start="151.98" dur="2.583">and 30% better GPU performance.</text><text start="155.55" dur="1.74">This in front of me here</text><text start="157.29" dur="4.71">is a maxed out M2 Max with the 38 core GPU</text><text start="162" dur="4.974">and the new maximum of
96 gigs of shared memory.</text><text start="166.974" dur="2.316">Shocker, this thing rips.</text><text start="169.29" dur="1.29">So under the hood, it&amp;#39;s built on</text><text start="170.58" dur="2.04">a new second gen 5 nanometer process,</text><text start="172.62" dur="1.47">and they&amp;#39;ve added some cores,</text><text start="174.09" dur="2.67">two more high efficiency CPU cores</text><text start="176.76" dur="2.34">and three more GPU cores on the Pro,</text><text start="179.1" dur="2.58">so it&amp;#39;s a 19 core GPU on the M2 Pro.</text><text start="181.68" dur="2.88">And a 38 core GPU on the M2 Max.</text><text start="184.56" dur="1.89">Also, the neural engine and media engine</text><text start="186.45" dur="1.86">are improved to handle machine learning</text><text start="188.31" dur="1.71">and media playback and transcoding</text><text start="190.02" dur="2.28">even faster than they already did.</text><text start="192.3" dur="1.32">If you&amp;#39;re into synthetic benchmarks,</text><text start="193.62" dur="1.44">I did run Geekbench 5</text><text start="195.06" dur="1.539">and the single core score</text><text start="196.599" dur="4.183">is now the highest I have
ever seen, just over 2,000,</text><text start="200.782" dur="2.678">while the multi-core
score was north of 15,000.</text><text start="203.46" dur="1.47">Here&amp;#39;s some context to give you an idea</text><text start="204.93" dur="2.28">of how impressive these numbers are.</text><text start="207.21" dur="1.35">And yes, that is about</text><text start="208.56" dur="2.25">the 20% CPU improvement that we expected.</text><text start="210.81" dur="1.29">And then, in Cinebench, again,</text><text start="212.1" dur="2.25">it had a chart topping single core score</text><text start="214.35" dur="2.67">and here&amp;#39;s how the multi-core stacks out.</text><text start="217.02" dur="1.32">So overall capabilities,</text><text start="218.34" dur="2.25">basically the ceiling has been raised up</text><text start="220.59" dur="3.03">by the 20 to 30%, which is
great, but as I mentioned</text><text start="223.62" dur="3.12">in the original M1 Max
review a year and a half ago,</text><text start="226.74" dur="3.028">it&amp;#39;s not so much about
the raw processing power</text><text start="229.768" dur="2.942">as much as it&amp;#39;s about the things</text><text start="232.71" dur="4.04">that it allows you to do
better or faster than before,</text><text start="236.75" dur="2.65">hence the name Pro, theoretically.</text><text start="239.4" dur="1.11">So like I noticed this in things</text><text start="240.51" dur="1.41">where I have parts of my workflow</text><text start="241.92" dur="1.05">that work just right with it.</text><text start="242.97" dur="0.833">So I have this same I do</text><text start="243.803" dur="2.257">where I screen record with ScreenFlow</text><text start="246.06" dur="2.13">and it&amp;#39;ll do a full
resolution screen recording</text><text start="248.19" dur="2.58">and then I&amp;#39;ll export that and use it</text><text start="250.77" dur="1.38">and bring into Final Cut Pro.</text><text start="252.15" dur="2.31">The exporting of that screen recording</text><text start="254.46" dur="2.88">into ProRes 422 was dramatically improved</text><text start="257.34" dur="1.86">when we got the media
engine with Apple Silicon.</text><text start="259.2" dur="1.98">So a 16 core Intel Mac Pro</text><text start="261.18" dur="1.53">with a Vega Pro II Duo</text><text start="262.71" dur="2.383">that retailed for over $15,000,</text><text start="265.093" dur="1.907">took a three and a half
minute screen recording</text><text start="267" dur="2.7">and churned that out in 56 seconds.</text><text start="269.7" dur="3.18">But the M1 max laptop
did it in 32 seconds,</text><text start="272.88" dur="1.47">So that was so sick,</text><text start="274.35" dur="0.833">that&amp;#39;s one of those things</text><text start="275.183" dur="1.459">you instantly notice is way faster.</text><text start="276.642" dur="4.248">This new M2 Max did it in 23 seconds.</text><text start="280.89" dur="2.34">So again, a pretty
substantial improvement.</text><text start="283.23" dur="1.98">Like, clearly the outgoing
machines weren&amp;#39;t lacking</text><text start="285.21" dur="2.49">but they&amp;#39;ve taken basically
everything that was good</text><text start="287.7" dur="1.56">about the old ones and improved it,</text><text start="289.26" dur="1.906">just bumped it up a little
bit, which is sweet.</text><text start="291.166" dur="2.894">For everyday daily non-demanding tasks</text><text start="294.06" dur="1.35">as you can probably imagine,</text><text start="295.41" dur="2.49">these are still great, totally great.</text><text start="297.9" dur="1.53">Like, I&amp;#39;ve already told you all about</text><text start="299.43" dur="1.53">the excellent mini LED display</text><text start="300.96" dur="2.25">that has a questionable
amount of light bleed</text><text start="303.21" dur="2.669">but still looks pretty
great most of the time.</text><text start="305.879" dur="3.001">I&amp;#39;ve already told you
about the top-notch design</text><text start="308.88" dur="2.16">and all of the metal build quality,</text><text start="311.04" dur="3.026">the huge track pad, the
high quality headphone jack,</text><text start="314.066" dur="2.434">the return of the built-in SD card slot,</text><text start="316.5" dur="1.05">I&amp;#39;ve already told you about all that,</text><text start="317.55" dur="1.32">but what about those
other tiny improvements</text><text start="318.87" dur="1.858">I mentioned earlier
that aren&amp;#39;t the M2 chip?</text><text start="320.728" dur="1.622">Well, there&amp;#39;s a couple things.</text><text start="322.35" dur="2.52">So first of all, the
extra efficiency cores</text><text start="324.87" dur="1.77">that I mentioned earlier are great,</text><text start="326.64" dur="1.17">of course, for battery life.</text><text start="327.81" dur="2.179">Not only is the battery
life still really good</text><text start="329.989" dur="2.424">but there&amp;#39;s also a claimed extra hour</text><text start="332.413" dur="2.987">on both the 14 inch
and 16 inch of battery.</text><text start="335.4" dur="1.35">I&amp;#39;m not seeing a dramatic difference,</text><text start="336.75" dur="2.55">but, hey, the fact that it&amp;#39;s
better at all, it&amp;#39;s sick.</text><text start="339.3" dur="1.38">And then these laptops still fast charge</text><text start="340.68" dur="2.82">but there&amp;#39;s also now a color
matching MagSafe cable.</text><text start="343.5" dur="1.65">Now this is a slight difference</text><text start="345.15" dur="2.52">since these laptops are really only silver</text><text start="347.67" dur="2.73">or slightly darker
silver, but there you go,</text><text start="350.4" dur="2.49">it&amp;#39;s darker now with a
space gray one, it matches,</text><text start="352.89" dur="1.14">color matching all the way up</text><text start="354.03" dur="3.09">until the white plastic
USB-C nub on the other end.</text><text start="357.12" dur="1.356">And then there&amp;#39;s a few other capabilities</text><text start="358.476" dur="5">WiFI 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1.</text><text start="364.96" dur="2.21">So HDMI 2.1 was actually something</text><text start="367.17" dur="2.7">I was confused about
missing on the last version</text><text start="369.87" dur="1.41">since it had been out for a little bit.</text><text start="371.28" dur="1.74">But it&amp;#39;s now here and that allows for</text><text start="373.02" dur="3.548">up to 8K 60FPSs through one
cable via the HDMI port.</text><text start="376.568" dur="1.508">So that&amp;#39;s about time.</text><text start="378.076" dur="2.774">WiFi 6E is just sort of
starting to roll out now,</text><text start="380.85" dur="1.77">that&amp;#39;s gonna be great for future proofing.</text><text start="382.62" dur="2.85">We literally just got WiFi
6E routers in the studio</text><text start="385.47" dur="2.31">for the first time and the MacBook Pros</text><text start="387.78" dur="1.98">have consistently been
like the fastest thing</text><text start="389.76" dur="1.26">on our wifi network,</text><text start="391.02" dur="2.58">and it continues to stretch
that lead in that department.</text><text start="393.6" dur="1.92">And Bluetooth 5.3, again,</text><text start="395.52" dur="2.37">very much future proofing,
but that&amp;#39;s welcome.</text><text start="397.89" dur="2.64">But really the Apple Silicon
transition has come a long way</text><text start="400.53" dur="3.66">since the very first M1 Max that we saw</text><text start="404.19" dur="1.47">when they first started doing this.</text><text start="405.66" dur="2.23">There are a lot more well optimized apps,</text><text start="407.89" dur="1.85">it&amp;#39;s a lot more obvious
what the benefits are.</text><text start="409.74" dur="1.35">It&amp;#39;s still not complete, of course,</text><text start="411.09" dur="2.416">because we don&amp;#39;t have a Mac Pro yet,</text><text start="413.506" dur="3.014">and also it kind of feels like
they forgot about the iMac.</text><text start="416.52" dur="3.603">That&amp;#39;s just chilling, still
stuck at M1, for some reason.</text><text start="421.14" dur="3.15">But really, yeah, these are
a level up from the rest.</text><text start="424.29" dur="2.28">And I think my overall
recommendations about what to buy</text><text start="426.57" dur="2.04">at certain spots in the lineup
basically stays the same.</text><text start="428.61" dur="1.05">So if you&amp;#39;re after battery life,</text><text start="429.66" dur="1.5">M2 Pro is gonna be awesome,</text><text start="431.16" dur="2.31">if you&amp;#39;re after maximum power</text><text start="433.47" dur="1.62">at the expense of some
of your battery life,</text><text start="435.09" dur="2.4">then M2 Max is probably the move.</text><text start="437.49" dur="1.92">And really my pretty
textbook conclusion here</text><text start="439.41" dur="2.46">is these laptops aren&amp;#39;t for people</text><text start="441.87" dur="3.12">who already have the M1
Pro and M1 Max laptops</text><text start="444.99" dur="0.99">that just came out,</text><text start="445.98" dur="1.95">they are for people who have older laptops</text><text start="447.93" dur="3.33">that now have a better
machine to upgrade to,</text><text start="451.26" dur="2.76">unless you&amp;#39;re one of a
tiny fraction of people</text><text start="454.02" dur="0.96">who got the old ones</text><text start="454.98" dur="1.68">and was pushing it to its limits</text><text start="456.66" dur="1.86">and just needs that 30% more power,</text><text start="458.52" dur="1.11">in which case, you know who you are.</text><text start="459.63" dur="1.92">Matter of fact, for those
people on older laptops,</text><text start="461.55" dur="1.67">I think looking for sales now</text><text start="463.22" dur="2.163">of the M1 Pro and M1 Max,</text><text start="465.383" dur="2.477">when you start to find deals on those,</text><text start="467.86" dur="1.97">those are gonna be really good laptops.</text><text start="469.83" dur="1.2">Now, you might have also seen the rumors</text><text start="471.03" dur="4.23">that it&amp;#39;s possible that
the first of the M3 laptops</text><text start="475.26" dur="2.85">is gonna be coming out
later this calendar year</text><text start="478.11" dur="2.13">on a three nanometer process,</text><text start="480.24" dur="2.22">and you might be wondering
if you should wait for that.</text><text start="482.46" dur="2.01">To which I would say,
you should actually wait</text><text start="484.47" dur="4.8">till quarter three of
2027 when we have the M5s</text><text start="489.27" dur="2.162">because that&amp;#39;ll be 30% faster than the M4s</text><text start="491.432" dur="2.662">which is 30% faster than the M3s,</text><text start="494.094" dur="2.616">and you can see where I&amp;#39;m going with this.</text><text start="496.71" dur="2.37">Like, if you&amp;#39;re gonna be
waiting for the next thing,</text><text start="499.08" dur="2.22">you&amp;#39;ll just be waiting forever</text><text start="501.3" dur="1.83">&amp;#39;cause that&amp;#39;s just the way tech is.</text><text start="503.13" dur="2.01">These are great machines,</text><text start="505.14" dur="1.71">they&amp;#39;re more than most people need,</text><text start="506.85" dur="2.01">and if you can get your hands on the M1s,</text><text start="508.86" dur="1.65">those are gonna be really
good for most people too.</text><text start="510.51" dur="1.35">Either way, make sure you get subscribed</text><text start="511.86" dur="1.98">because I think,</text><text start="513.84" dur="3.6">I think actually the new M2 Mac Minis</text><text start="517.44" dur="3.45">are a way more interesting machine,</text><text start="520.89" dur="1.45">so stay tuned for that video.</text><text start="523.5" dur="5">Also, I said something
in in my last review.</text><text start="529.95" dur="0.833">With that being said,</text><text start="530.783" dur="2.077">if the next version of this laptop</text><text start="532.86" dur="3.663">still has a notch this big
and doesn&amp;#39;t add Face ID,</text><text start="537.84" dur="3.03">I&amp;#39;ll wear socks and sandals
for a day, like Linus.</text><text start="540.87" dur="1.89">Like, they gotta be planning on</text><text start="542.76" dur="1.75">putting it there eventually, right?</text><text start="547.738" dur="4.682">Well, all day today,</text><text start="552.42" dur="1.32">I&amp;#39;m a man of my word.</text><text start="553.74" dur="1.23">Thanks for watching,</text><text start="554.97" dur="2.275">catch you guys in the next one, peace.</text><text start="557.245" dur="2.667">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
