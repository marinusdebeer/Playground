<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.035" dur="3.218">(light music)</text><text start="3.253" dur="3.857">- Hey, what&amp;#39;s up, MKBHD here
and I&amp;#39;ve got the latest beta</text><text start="7.11" dur="3.06">of Android 15 on my
Pixel 8 Pro right here.</text><text start="10.17" dur="0.833">So a lot of you know,</text><text start="11.003" dur="0.937">I&amp;#39;ve done these videos for a long time.</text><text start="11.94" dur="2.85">Like I&amp;#39;ve made a video
on the best features</text><text start="14.79" dur="1.44">of the latest version of Android</text><text start="16.23" dur="2.25">for I don&amp;#39;t know how
many years in a row now,</text><text start="18.48" dur="1.74">since they were naming &amp;#39;em after desserts.</text><text start="20.22" dur="1.23">And if you&amp;#39;ve been watching all of these,</text><text start="21.45" dur="2.01">then you&amp;#39;ve noticed a trend,</text><text start="23.46" dur="3.6">which is there used to
be huge new features</text><text start="27.06" dur="2.97">and massive like visual
overhauls and all sorts</text><text start="30.03" dur="2.52">of crazy gigantic things
changing with Android.</text><text start="32.55" dur="2.91">But now things have
stabilized, I would say.</text><text start="35.46" dur="1.59">It&amp;#39;s a lot more small changes</text><text start="37.05" dur="1.8">and more nuanced things here and there.</text><text start="38.85" dur="3.42">So it&amp;#39;s gotten to the point
where these top five features</text><text start="42.27" dur="2.4">of Android 15, back in the day,</text><text start="44.67" dur="2.7">this would&amp;#39;ve been like a .0.2 update.</text><text start="47.37" dur="2.76">Like, these are smaller and smaller</text><text start="50.13" dur="1.56">new features with each new version.</text><text start="51.69" dur="2.917">But on the other hand, that
actually feels like it is...</text><text start="54.607" dur="1.553">They&amp;#39;re a little more well considered.</text><text start="56.16" dur="1.5">They&amp;#39;re more about usefulness,</text><text start="57.66" dur="1.59">they&amp;#39;re more about little tweaks here</text><text start="59.25" dur="1.62">and there to make actually using</text><text start="60.87" dur="1.98">and owning your phone a little bit better.</text><text start="62.85" dur="1.14">So I can appreciate that.</text><text start="63.99" dur="1.41">And I will also say it, it&amp;#39;s felt like</text><text start="65.4" dur="1.71">in videos in the past, I&amp;#39;ve said that,</text><text start="67.11" dur="1.86">you know, this is a version
that&amp;#39;s only gonna show up</text><text start="68.97" dur="1.8">on the Pixel for at least a year</text><text start="70.77" dur="2.447">and you may never get to see
the newest version of Android,</text><text start="73.217" dur="2.983">but I feel like with a lot
of the newest companies</text><text start="76.2" dur="1.74">actually promising a good amount</text><text start="77.94" dur="1.493">of software updates into the future,</text><text start="79.433" dur="2.407">hopefully more people will actually</text><text start="81.84" dur="1.92">see these couple of things.</text><text start="83.76" dur="1.41">So I&amp;#39;m just gonna jump right in.</text><text start="85.17" dur="2.07">These are the top five best features</text><text start="87.24" dur="1.92">I&amp;#39;ve found in Android 15.</text><text start="89.16" dur="4.77">So number five is called
Private Space and it&amp;#39;s,</text><text start="93.93" dur="1.245">yeah, it&amp;#39;s exactly what it sounds like.</text><text start="95.175" dur="3.495">It&amp;#39;s a private space on your Android phone</text><text start="98.67" dur="4.08">for your top secret files and photos</text><text start="102.75" dur="2.28">and whatever else you got in there.</text><text start="105.03" dur="2.28">So to turn it on, you go to Settings</text><text start="107.31" dur="1.77">and then Security &amp;amp; Privacy</text><text start="109.08" dur="2.07">and then Private Space is near the bottom.</text><text start="111.15" dur="2.94">So you confirm it&amp;#39;s you and
you pick a Google account</text><text start="114.09" dur="2.4">and a new lock if you want.</text><text start="116.49" dur="1.68">Then this Private Space is set up</text><text start="118.17" dur="2.61">and basically you can
always find it all the way</text><text start="120.78" dur="1.41">at the bottom of your app drawer,</text><text start="122.19" dur="1.29">like that&amp;#39;s where it lives.</text><text start="123.48" dur="2.46">So obviously, if you were to
like give someone your phone</text><text start="125.94" dur="1.74">to borrow for a while, you
could put it in Guest Mode</text><text start="127.68" dur="1.23">and it would just basically be a brand</text><text start="128.91" dur="1.29">new phone for them set up.</text><text start="130.2" dur="1.77">But yeah, Private Space is different.</text><text start="131.97" dur="2.28">It&amp;#39;s more of just a separate section</text><text start="134.25" dur="2.37">under a separate lock underneath the phone</text><text start="136.62" dur="2.28">that you&amp;#39;re already logged
into and signed up for.</text><text start="138.9" dur="1.8">So it&amp;#39;s basically a
whole new little section</text><text start="140.7" dur="2.491">of your phone hidden
away behind a second lock</text><text start="143.191" dur="3.749">for your top secret activities,</text><text start="146.94" dur="3.48">apps, files, photos, whatever you want.</text><text start="150.42" dur="2.91">And when you wanna hide it
away again, you just hit Lock.</text><text start="153.33" dur="3.53">You could put whatever you want
in there, totally up to you.</text><text start="156.86" dur="2.53">Then number four, so I&amp;#39;m kind</text><text start="159.39" dur="1.14">of combining a lot of these things.</text><text start="160.53" dur="1.32">I&amp;#39;ve done this in videos in the past.</text><text start="161.85" dur="1.92">It&amp;#39;s just a whole bunch
of the little things</text><text start="163.77" dur="1.38">that sort of stack up to feel</text><text start="165.15" dur="1.59">like a more refined experience.</text><text start="166.74" dur="1.98">So number four is the little things.</text><text start="168.72" dur="2.406">Like, one of them is rich widget previews,</text><text start="171.126" dur="1.554">which obviously is not a huge thing</text><text start="172.68" dur="1.56">&amp;#39;cause how often are you actually adding</text><text start="174.24" dur="1.47">new widgets to your home screen?</text><text start="175.71" dur="0.99">Not very much.</text><text start="176.7" dur="1.89">But when you do now, the widgets</text><text start="178.59" dur="2.112">that support this will
actually show you content</text><text start="180.702" dur="3.468">that will actually be on
them before they get added</text><text start="184.17" dur="1.35">and they&amp;#39;re in live and real time</text><text start="185.52" dur="2.4">and represent real things on your phone.</text><text start="187.92" dur="1.35">This could have maybe
been higher on my list,</text><text start="189.27" dur="1.17">but at this point it&amp;#39;s so new</text><text start="190.44" dur="2.82">that it&amp;#39;s basically only
like two of Google&amp;#39;s apps.</text><text start="193.26" dur="2.74">Like, it&amp;#39;s just the clocks
and widgets around that.</text><text start="196" dur="3.23">But it would be nice
to see more Google apps</text><text start="199.23" dur="2.61">and even more third party apps adopt this.</text><text start="201.84" dur="3.57">Like, I want to see, in the
example widget before I add it,</text><text start="205.41" dur="3.21">like one of my actual notion
boards instead of a made-up one</text><text start="208.62" dur="3.39">or one of my actual contacts
instead of a random person.</text><text start="212.01" dur="2.55">Another one is this new back animation</text><text start="214.56" dur="1.98">when you move backwards
through like settings</text><text start="216.54" dur="2.28">or anything with multiple
layers that you can back out of.</text><text start="218.82" dur="1.83">I think it&amp;#39;s a little bit
smoother, a little nicer.</text><text start="220.65" dur="1.83">Another one is Bluetooth audio sharing.</text><text start="222.48" dur="1.65">You can have multiple headphones paired</text><text start="224.13" dur="2.1">to the same Bluetooth audio source</text><text start="226.23" dur="1.56">as long as they support Bluetooth LE,</text><text start="227.79" dur="1.62">which most new headphones do.</text><text start="229.41" dur="2.01">Another one is High Quality Mode</text><text start="231.42" dur="2.55">when you use your Android
phone as your webcam.</text><text start="233.97" dur="2.22">Another one is Bluetooth Auto On.</text><text start="236.19" dur="1.69">So if you turn Bluetooth
off on your phone,</text><text start="237.88" dur="2.36">then the next day it automatically
gets turned back on again</text><text start="240.24" dur="1.05">so you don&amp;#39;t have to remember to.</text><text start="241.29" dur="2.1">And there&amp;#39;s just a whole bunch
more little things like that.</text><text start="243.39" dur="3">It feels like every year
Google pays attention</text><text start="246.39" dur="2.169">to the little things about
the way we use our phones</text><text start="248.559" dur="2.608">and then can add stuff to help us there.</text><text start="251.167" dur="1.36">But speaking of little things,</text><text start="252.527" dur="2.533">I&amp;#39;m making number three by itself one</text><text start="255.06" dur="3">of those little things, which
is the new volume sliders.</text><text start="258.06" dur="1.74">So right now when I hit Volume,</text><text start="259.8" dur="1.86">it looks the way it normally does,</text><text start="261.66" dur="2.76">the Auto Live Caption button
is still there on the Pixel,</text><text start="264.42" dur="1.23">totally underrated feature,</text><text start="265.65" dur="1.68">and then your mode switcher at the top.</text><text start="267.33" dur="2.66">But then when you hit
the three dots to expand,</text><text start="269.99" dur="4.39">you get this whole almost
full screen overlay showing</text><text start="274.38" dur="1.53">where you&amp;#39;re playing audio to</text><text start="275.91" dur="1.5">and then all of the sliders for volume</text><text start="277.41" dur="1.47">of everything happening on your phone.</text><text start="278.88" dur="2.31">And this is something, you
know, that&amp;#39;s been smaller</text><text start="281.19" dur="2.85">and in various other forms and
previous versions of Android,</text><text start="284.04" dur="1.17">but I like this big one.</text><text start="285.21" dur="1.475">Just makes it super clear what&amp;#39;s going on</text><text start="286.685" dur="4.135">and how loud each individual
thing is going to be.</text><text start="290.82" dur="1.71">So then now we&amp;#39;re getting to the top.</text><text start="292.53" dur="3.934">Number two is partial screen recordings.</text><text start="296.464" dur="2.846">So I think normally when you do</text><text start="299.31" dur="1.26">a screen recording on your phone,</text><text start="300.57" dur="2.4">you just expect to see everything, right?</text><text start="302.97" dur="2.52">You just start it, it&amp;#39;s your home screen,</text><text start="305.49" dur="2.22">it&amp;#39;s every single app you switch between,</text><text start="307.71" dur="2.13">everything happening on your phone.</text><text start="309.84" dur="1.44">That&amp;#39;s a normal screen recording.</text><text start="311.28" dur="1.29">But I&amp;#39;ve been playing with
screen recordings here</text><text start="312.57" dur="1.89">on the Pixel with this dev preview</text><text start="314.46" dur="3">and it&amp;#39;s a lot smarter about only showing</text><text start="317.46" dur="3.12">if you want individual single things</text><text start="320.58" dur="1.08">happening on your phone.</text><text start="321.66" dur="1.86">So when you go to initiate
a screen recording,</text><text start="323.52" dur="1.98">you can either do the entire screen,</text><text start="325.5" dur="2.7">which is normal, or a single app.</text><text start="328.2" dur="1.62">So check this out, if I do single app</text><text start="329.82" dur="1.98">and then start recording,
it gives me a picker</text><text start="331.8" dur="2.82">to choose which app I want to record.</text><text start="334.62" dur="1.53">I&amp;#39;ll pick one of the
ones I already have open,</text><text start="336.15" dur="2.4">Relay Reddit, just for this example.</text><text start="338.55" dur="1.65">The countdown starts at the top</text><text start="340.2" dur="2.64">and then it&amp;#39;s recording this Reddit app.</text><text start="342.84" dur="2.731">So I can scroll around,
just use it as usual,</text><text start="345.571" dur="2.009">but now watch, if I go home</text><text start="347.58" dur="1.77">and then open another app like Photos</text><text start="349.35" dur="1.62">and then scroll around in here,</text><text start="350.97" dur="3.15">and then go back home,
go back to the Relay app,</text><text start="354.12" dur="2.79">then scroll some more,
that&amp;#39;s the screen recording.</text><text start="356.91" dur="1.5">Now check this out, when you go</text><text start="358.41" dur="2.22">to watch the screen
recording, it looks normal,</text><text start="360.63" dur="3.51">but then the moment I go
home and then go to Photos,</text><text start="364.14" dur="2.31">see, that doesn&amp;#39;t show up
in the screen recording.</text><text start="366.45" dur="2.878">It&amp;#39;s still just recording the Reddit app</text><text start="369.328" dur="2.222">even though it&amp;#39;s in the background now.</text><text start="371.55" dur="1.62">And then you can see when I get back to it</text><text start="373.17" dur="0.93">and starts scrolling some more,</text><text start="374.1" dur="1.05">it picks up where it left off.</text><text start="375.15" dur="3.93">So it&amp;#39;s only specifically
showing what I want you to see.</text><text start="379.08" dur="1.23">And this is super useful.</text><text start="380.31" dur="2.359">I think this is my new
default for screen recordings.</text><text start="382.669" dur="2.081">You don&amp;#39;t have to see, you know,</text><text start="384.75" dur="1.65">a random text message I have coming in</text><text start="386.4" dur="2.46">or me copying and pasting a security code</text><text start="388.86" dur="1.29">from another app or anything like that.</text><text start="390.15" dur="1.92">It&amp;#39;s just me giving you a tutorial</text><text start="392.07" dur="2.958">on like one exact thing
that I wanna show you.</text><text start="395.028" dur="1.272">That&amp;#39;s pretty cool.</text><text start="396.3" dur="2.028">But then number one, this
is one of those things</text><text start="398.328" dur="2.592">that Android has been really good at</text><text start="400.92" dur="1.59">and had the edge at for years,</text><text start="402.51" dur="2.43">which is just better notifications</text><text start="404.94" dur="1.47">and notification management.</text><text start="406.41" dur="2.006">And so far with these two previews,</text><text start="408.416" dur="3.244">it&amp;#39;s even better in
specifically a couple of ways.</text><text start="411.66" dur="2.46">There&amp;#39;s Adaptive Vibrations,</text><text start="414.12" dur="3.45">there is Notification Cool Down,
there is custom vibrations,</text><text start="417.57" dur="2.16">there&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of stuff,
so I&amp;#39;ll walk through each.</text><text start="419.73" dur="2.82">So Adaptive Vibration is fascinating.</text><text start="422.55" dur="1.11">It kind of just seems like another one</text><text start="423.66" dur="1.71">of those magic-feeling Google things,</text><text start="425.37" dur="3.36">but you go into Vibration
Settings and just turn it on,</text><text start="428.73" dur="1.47">there&amp;#39;s no further settings.</text><text start="430.2" dur="3.03">But it basically says it&amp;#39;s
using your phone&amp;#39;s mic</text><text start="433.23" dur="3.06">and other sensors to determine
the sound levels around it</text><text start="436.29" dur="3.6">and potentially even what
type of surface it&amp;#39;s on</text><text start="439.89" dur="1.8">to set the strength of vibration</text><text start="441.69" dur="1.95">so you can always feel or hear it.</text><text start="443.64" dur="2.22">So the idea is if your phone
is on like a desk somewhere</text><text start="445.86" dur="1.41">or a hard surface, it doesn&amp;#39;t have</text><text start="447.27" dur="2.49">to rattle the thing at maximum strength</text><text start="449.76" dur="1.95">to be heard, it can turn it down.</text><text start="451.71" dur="3.24">But then if it&amp;#39;s on a
couch or something softer,</text><text start="454.95" dur="2.82">it will pick that up and
it will vibrate more loudly</text><text start="457.77" dur="3.6">or more firmly so you can
actually still hear it, clever.</text><text start="461.37" dur="2.37">And then there&amp;#39;s another thing
in Dev Preview 1 at least</text><text start="463.74" dur="2.46">that was called Notification Cool Down,</text><text start="466.2" dur="2.31">which is literally just a setting</text><text start="468.51" dur="1.38">to be able to help you manage</text><text start="469.89" dur="1.95">when you get a ton of notifications</text><text start="471.84" dur="2.61">from the same app over and over in a row.</text><text start="474.45" dur="1.95">&amp;#39;Cause we&amp;#39;ve all been in that
group chat that&amp;#39;s going nuts</text><text start="476.4" dur="2.4">or the Slack channel that won&amp;#39;t shut up,</text><text start="478.8" dur="2.73">or Asana or whatever,</text><text start="481.53" dur="2.1">something that&amp;#39;s just
constantly pinging you over</text><text start="483.63" dur="1.445">and over with the same app.</text><text start="485.075" dur="2.605">And so Notification Cool
Down, when you enable that,</text><text start="487.68" dur="2.88">will just sort of taper that
off and keep you updated</text><text start="490.56" dur="1.968">on when a bunch of new
stuff comes in, but not</text><text start="492.528" dur="2.562">just buzz you over and over.
(fingers tapping)</text><text start="495.09" dur="2.61">Now that was in Dev Preview 1</text><text start="497.7" dur="2.13">and then this is Dev Preview 2</text><text start="499.83" dur="1.32">and it&amp;#39;s not in this one, it&amp;#39;s gone.</text><text start="501.15" dur="1.56">I&amp;#39;m not sure why, but I
hope they bring that back.</text><text start="502.71" dur="1.8">I hope they keep it
&amp;#39;cause that&amp;#39;s pretty sick.</text><text start="504.51" dur="1.826">And then there&amp;#39;s even
more subtle one that&amp;#39;s,</text><text start="506.336" dur="1.954">&amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s basically hidden to users,</text><text start="508.29" dur="1.62">this is something developers have seen,</text><text start="509.91" dur="4.62">which is individual
vibration patterns per app.</text><text start="514.53" dur="2.37">&amp;#39;Cause see, some of you
aren&amp;#39;t old enough to remember</text><text start="516.9" dur="3.96">when smartphones had LED
notification lights on them,</text><text start="520.86" dur="1.89">multicolor lights that would actually</text><text start="522.75" dur="1.97">have a different color light up based on</text><text start="524.72" dur="2.2">what app you were getting
a notification from.</text><text start="526.92" dur="2.25">So I could know, without
waking up my phone,</text><text start="529.17" dur="2.01">if I had a blinking blue light happening,</text><text start="531.18" dur="3.3">oh, that&amp;#39;s a Twitter
notification, I can ignore it.</text><text start="534.48" dur="1.8">Or if it was a blinking green light,</text><text start="536.28" dur="3.341">then it&amp;#39;s a new Gmail
notification and I can ignore it.</text><text start="539.621" dur="1.969">But if it&amp;#39;s a new blinking red light,</text><text start="541.59" dur="3.54">then it&amp;#39;s a new missed
call and I can ignore it.</text><text start="545.13" dur="1.17">But then phones all got
rid of these lights.</text><text start="546.3" dur="1.59">So now we wake up our phones</text><text start="547.89" dur="1.29">every time I wanna check on something.</text><text start="549.18" dur="2.52">And if you have it always on
display, that can be useful.</text><text start="551.7" dur="3.681">But in a surface shown to developers,</text><text start="555.381" dur="2.288">they have the ability now to customize</text><text start="557.669" dur="4.111">their own vibration pattern
specific to their app.</text><text start="561.78" dur="1.82">So I think that&amp;#39;s pretty sick.</text><text start="563.6" dur="4">I&amp;#39;m kinda hoping, and this
is totally just hoping,</text><text start="567.6" dur="2.73">but I hope that they surface
that to users as well.</text><text start="570.33" dur="1.83">I hope, just like I&amp;#39;ve been able to pick</text><text start="572.16" dur="2.16">between a bunch of
different weather icon apps</text><text start="574.32" dur="1.71">for my one app that does weather,</text><text start="576.03" dur="1.08">I hope they let me choose</text><text start="577.11" dur="2.048">between a couple custom vibration sounds</text><text start="579.158" dur="2.49">or vibration patterns for apps</text><text start="581.648" dur="2.712">because I would love to customize</text><text start="584.36" dur="3.94">and feel that I&amp;#39;ve gotten
a Twitter notification</text><text start="588.3" dur="0.9">and that I can still ignore it.</text><text start="589.2" dur="1.95">Now for those wondering,
since we check every year,</text><text start="591.15" dur="1.47">when you go into Settings,</text><text start="592.62" dur="2.85">it doesn&amp;#39;t actually say Android 15,</text><text start="595.47" dur="4.14">it says Vanilla Ice Cream
for this Dev Preview 2.</text><text start="599.61" dur="2.76">And when you click into it,
this is the animated Easter egg,</text><text start="602.37" dur="1.68">which looks nothing
like vanilla ice cream,</text><text start="604.05" dur="2.76">but for what it&amp;#39;s worth, it&amp;#39;s
a little more space-like.</text><text start="606.81" dur="2.55">But now here&amp;#39;s the thing, if
you hold it down long enough,</text><text start="609.36" dur="3.12">it speeds up all the way and then snaps</text><text start="612.48" dur="4.276">and turns into this, this
sort of random spacecraft</text><text start="616.756" dur="3.884">in the middle of what seems
like a nearly infinite canvas.</text><text start="620.64" dur="1.59">Kinda reminds me of that asteroids game</text><text start="622.23" dur="0.833">from back in the day.</text><text start="623.063" dur="0.937">But you don&amp;#39;t shoot anything,</text><text start="624" dur="3.12">you just kinda fly around
using this thrust vector</text><text start="627.12" dur="3.42">and explore this gigantic space.</text><text start="630.54" dur="2.97">The only thing that worries
me is that in the corner,</text><text start="633.51" dur="2.823">it says BODIES: 0 / 10.</text><text start="636.333" dur="3.717">So I think if people explore
this thing long enough,</text><text start="640.05" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re gonna find bodies,
whatever that means.</text><text start="644.01" dur="2.43">But yeah, like I said, a
bunch of subtle things,</text><text start="646.44" dur="2.04">some new notification
stuff here and there,</text><text start="648.48" dur="3.18">some new management usage
of your phone type stuff.</text><text start="651.66" dur="2.52">It&amp;#39;s nuanced, it&amp;#39;s subtle.</text><text start="654.18" dur="3.36">I&amp;#39;m still excited for some of
the bigger AI-based features</text><text start="657.54" dur="2.04">to drop because that&amp;#39;s the
stuff that we&amp;#39;re expecting</text><text start="659.58" dur="2.25">to make a big difference
the way we use our phones.</text><text start="661.83" dur="3.531">It&amp;#39;s just not built into Android anymore.</text><text start="665.361" dur="2.719">It&amp;#39;s the AI stuff that
your phone is capable of</text><text start="668.08" dur="2.39">that&amp;#39;s not in the OS.
(soft music)</text><text start="670.47" dur="2.52">It&amp;#39;s still good to see
good OS features too.</text><text start="672.99" dur="1.02">Lemme know what your favorite one is</text><text start="674.01" dur="1.08">or if you agree with my order</text><text start="675.09" dur="2.199">of the top five in the
comments section below.</text><text start="677.289" dur="4.402">Thanks for watching, catch
you in the next one, peace.</text><text start="681.691" dur="3.25">(soft music continues)</text></transcript>
