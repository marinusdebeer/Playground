a built-in screen here.</text><text start="67.02" dur="1.41">And instead of built-in cellular,</text><text start="68.43" dur="1.86">it has a SIM card tray right alongside</text><text start="70.29" dur="2.16">that USB Type-C port for charging.</text><text start="72.45" dur="1.56">I&amp;#39;d say it does seem to send basically</text><text start="74.01" dur="2.37">every single request to

once to put it to sleep.</text><text start="120.15" dur="2.22">Or it would do that automatically

also bad at a lot of stuff.</text><text start="225.48" dur="2.49">And this list is gonna
sound pretty familiar.</text><text start="227.97" dur="3.78">Somehow, the battery life is
just as bad as the Humane Pin.</text><text start="231.75" dur="2.7">It has a thousand million
power battery inside</text><text start="234.45" dur="1.41">and it&amp;#39;s brutally bad.</text><text start="235.86" dur="1.11">Like it&amp;#39;s already bad enough</text><text start="236.97" dur="1.89">when you&amp;#39;re carrying around
a whole nother device</text><text start="238.86" dur="1.89">alongside your smartphone,</text><text start="240.75" dur="2.94">but when this one can sit in

you wake up in the morning.</text><text start="252.42" dur="1.53">Like, it&amp;#39;s just exhausting.</text><text start="253.95" dur="3.42">Also, it took 45 minutes
to charge this tiny battery</text><text start="257.37" dur="1.17">from zero to a hundred.</text><text start="258.54" dur="1.8">And it&amp;#39;s also just straight up missing</text><text start="260.34" dur="2.76">a ton of what I would
consider just basic features.</text><text start="263.1" dur="2.46">Like it can&amp;#39;t set
alarms, can&amp;#39;t set timers,</text><text start="265.56" dur="2.64">it can&amp;#39;t record videos,
can&amp;#39;t record photos,</text><text start="268.2" dur="2.91">can&amp;#39;t send emails, there&amp;#39;s
no calendar built in.</text><text start="271.11" dur="2.22">There&amp;#39;s just a lot of
things that I would want</text><text start="273.33" dur="1.56">an assistant to do...</text><text start="274.89" dur="0.833">Not here.</text><text start="275.723" dur="1.627">And of course, being an AI assistant,</text><text start="277.35" dur="2.61">it also does still hallucinate,</text><text start="279.96" dur="2.52">and confidently answer questions wrong.</text><text start="282.48" dur="1.89">Like my baseline of asking a question</text><text start="284.37" dur="1.38">that I know the answer to,</text><text start="285.75" dur="3.48">and then getting the wrong
answer happens all the time.</text><text start="289.23" dur="1.56">Which is one of the
downfalls of this category.</text><text start="290.79" dur="3.45">So this device was designed
by Teenage Engineering.</text><text start="294.24" dur="1.62">And they&amp;#39;re really leaning into that.</text><text start="295.86" dur="0.833">Like that&amp;#39;s why...</text><text start="296.693" dur="3.457">I mean, it&amp;#39;s this bright
orange, it is really quirky,</text><text start="300.15" dur="4.02">friendly looking device, I
would say, intentionally.</text><text start="304.17" dur="2.76">But yeah, they really love
their analog controls.</text><text start="306.93" dur="3.15">And this scroll wheel
here doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me,</text><text start="310.08" dur="3.6">but it&amp;#39;s actually really
frustrating to use.</text><text start="313.68" dur="2.46">First of all, it protrudes
out the back a little bit,</text><text start="316.14" dur="0.833">as you can see.</text><text start="316.973" dur="1.777">Which looks kinda cool.</text><text start="318.75" dur="1.92">But that means if it was really sensitive,</text><text start="320.67" dur="2.31">that it would actually scroll
if you just put it down</text><text start="322.98" dur="1.53">on a table or something.</text><text start="324.51" dur="2.46">So they&amp;#39;ve dialed down the
sensitivity of the scroll wheel,</text><text start="326.97" dur="2.49">so it&amp;#39;s actually super slow.</text><text start="329.46" dur="2.07">Like there&amp;#39;s a surprising
amount of scroll motion</text><text start="331.53" dur="3">required to go down one
line in the settings.</text><text start="334.53" dur="2.34">And then there&amp;#39;s no haptic
feedback here as you&amp;#39;re scrolling</text><text start="336.87" dur="1.59">to help you feel it out.</text><text start="338.46" dur="1.92">So fine, okay, you can get used to that.</text><text start="340.38" dur="1.77">You use the button to select...</text><text start="342.15" dur="1.38">But then you&amp;#39;ve also noticed,</text><text start="343.53" dur="2.55">there&amp;#39;s no back button
anywhere on this device.</text><text start="346.08" dur="1.53">So to go back up a level,</text><text start="347.61" dur="3.15">you have to scroll all
the way back up to the top</text><text start="350.76" dur="2.34">every single time.</text><text start="353.1" dur="1.41">That also gets annoying.</text><text start="354.51" dur="2.94">And then to change brightness or volume,</text><text start="357.45" dur="1.23">you actually need two hands.</text><text start="358.68" dur="1.767">So you just go into brightness to select,</text><text start="360.447" dur="2.613">and you hold the button with one hand,</text><text start="363.06" dur="2.19">and then scroll the scroll wheel</text><text start="365.25" dur="2.58">with the other hand to adjust brightness.</text><text start="367.83" dur="2.55">Which, yeah, you can&amp;#39;t
do it with one hand.</text><text start="370.38" dur="3.173">It works, so you can learn
it, and you can say, you know,</text><text start="373.553" dur="1.807">it&amp;#39;s this quirky UI it&amp;#39;s got going on.</text><text start="375.36" dur="2.97">But I feel like a lot of
these problems would be solved</text><text start="378.33" dur="1.833">if this was a touch screen.</text><text start="381.33" dur="3.03">So what if I told you
this is a touch screen,</text><text start="384.36" dur="1.98">and they just don&amp;#39;t really let you use it</text><text start="386.34" dur="1.02">for almost anything?</text><text start="387.36" dur="2.19">Like moving through these
menus would be easier</text><text start="389.55" dur="2.19">if I could just tap
what I wanted to, right?</text><text start="391.74" dur="2.79">Going back after a long
scroll would be easier</text><text start="394.53" dur="2.28">if I could just flip scroll
back to the top of a list,</text><text start="396.81" dur="1.14">and hit back.</text><text start="397.95" dur="0.833">But you can&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="398.783" dur="1.717">The only thing you can
use the touchscreen for</text><text start="400.5" dur="3.06">is basically typing on the
keyboard in terminal mode.</text><text start="403.56" dur="3.48">So with terminal enabled,
you can turn it sideways,</text><text start="407.04" dur="2.91">a keyboard pops up, and
you can type your questions</text><text start="409.95" dur="1.23">and get text answers.</text><text start="411.18" dur="0.833">Which is great.</text><text start="412.013" dur="2.647">And you can move between
letters with the scroll wheel.</text><text start="414.66" dur="1.44">It&amp;#39;s kind of a neat feature, I guess.</text><text start="416.1" dur="4.44">But why can&amp;#39;t we use the touch
screen for anything else?</text><text start="420.54" dur="2.19">Is it just them trying
not to look too much</text><text start="422.73" dur="2.04">like a smartphone?</text><text start="424.77" dur="0.833">Maybe.</text><text start="426.66" dur="1.104">Probably.</text><text start="427.764" dur="1.956">(text clicking)

what are we doing here?</text><text start="437.49" dur="1.32">And really, there&amp;#39;s two things</text><text start="438.81" dur="2.16">that I think they&amp;#39;re

easy for everyone to dunk on</text><text start="462.12" dur="2.16">because it costs as much as a phone.</text><text start="464.28" dur="4.53">It was $700 with a $24

$200 and no subscription.</text><text start="477.09" dur="3.15">So, you know, okay, that
hits a little different.</text><text start="480.24" dur="3.6">But also, you can tell it&amp;#39;s $200.</text><text start="483.84" dur="2.1">First of all, you will
need a separate SIM card</text><text start="485.94" dur="1.44">to get it to work on cellular.</text><text start="487.38" dur="2.55">So while there is no
subscription fee for Rabbit</text><text start="489.93" dur="1.47">to keep the device working,</text><text start="491.4" dur="1.65">that is still a fee you&amp;#39;re

collaborated with Rabbit</text><text start="577.86" dur="1.11">ahead of the release to make sure</text><text start="578.97" dur="1.53">screen protectors for this thing</text><text start="580.5" dur="1.83">were also available on launch day.</text><text start="582.33" dur="1.08">So, that includes mine.</text><text start="583.41" dur="0.93">If you wanna check it out,</text><text start="584.34" dur="2.7">screen protectors or skins for the R1,</text><text start="587.04" dur="1.05">you can hit up the link below.</text><text start="588.09" dur="1.29">But yes, speaking of the screen,</text><text start="589.38" dur="4.89">this is a 2.9 inch diagonal TFT screen,</text><text start="594.27" dur="1.53">with no auto brightness.</text><text start="595.8" dur="2.781">So, yeah, I think you get the idea.</text><text start="598.581" dur="2.139">(letters clicking)
(soft music)</text><text start="600.72" dur="3.99">So you know how the
Humane Ai Pin had no apps?</text><text start="604.71" dur="2.19">Well, this thing also has no apps.</text><text start="606.9" dur="1.32">But the other thing that they&amp;#39;re hoping</text><text start="608.22" dur="2.07">will separate it from the other stuff,</text><text start="610.29" dur="2.64">is what they&amp;#39;re calling
a large action model.</text><text start="612.93" dur="3.24">So you know, large language
models are just the words,</text><text start="616.17" dur="1.05">the language that we use.</text><text start="617.22" dur="2.52">So it&amp;#39;s an AI that can
take our natural language,</text><text start="619.74" dur="3.3">and process it, and turn
it into words in return.</text><text start="623.04" dur="1.8">And that&amp;#39;s how we interact with it.</text><text start="624.84" dur="4.38">So a large action model is
supposed to take our words,</text><text start="629.22" dur="3.57">and then process it, and
turn it into actions.</text><text start="632.79" dur="0.833">That&amp;#39;s the theory.</text><text start="633.623" dur="4.117">So it&amp;#39;s basically going to
be able to use apps for you</text><text start="637.74" dur="1.02">like a human would,</text><text start="638.76" dur="1.2">based on what you tell it to do.</text><text start="639.96" dur="3.12">Now, importantly, this
isn&amp;#39;t the same as an API,</text><text start="643.08" dur="2.43">where you know, a company
might work with the others</text><text start="645.51" dur="2.513">to have some sort of a
plug into their services</text><text start="648.023" dur="1.867">so that they work together.</text><text start="649.89" dur="2.31">Because an API can be a
little too restrictive,</text><text start="652.2" dur="2.76">or not give all the features,
or just not quite...</text><text start="654.96" dur="1.14">I mean, there&amp;#39;s lots of good reasons</text><text start="656.1" dur="2.28">why they don&amp;#39;t wanna rely on an API.</text><text start="658.38" dur="1.71">So what this is supposed to be doing,</text><text start="660.09" dur="4.38">is just going in and using
the app, just like a human,</text><text start="664.47" dur="1.95">essentially with like
a mouse and a keyboard.</text><text start="666.42" dur="2.19">Think of it as like a virtual agent.</text><text start="668.61" dur="1.92">Honestly, I think it&amp;#39;s a really cool idea.</text><text start="670.53" dur="3.27">I think it&amp;#39;s a really, really cool idea.</text><text start="673.8" dur="1.89">You know, large language
models have been trained,</text><text start="675.69" dur="1.17">with all their data,</text><text start="676.86" dur="2.67">to talk back to us just like humans would,</text><text start="679.53" dur="1.83">and some are very convincing.</text><text start="681.36" dur="2.55">So a large action model, in theory,</text><text start="683.91" dur="3.24">should be able to use
these apps and services</text><text start="687.15" dur="1.95">just like a human would.</text><text start="689.1" dur="4.35">From Spotify to Twitter,
to your banking app,</text><text start="693.45" dur="1.29">to whatever else.</text><text start="694.74" dur="4.44">It&amp;#39;s already good enough at
recognizing major UI elements</text><text start="699.18" dur="3.63">like a play button or a buy
button and things like that.</text><text start="702.81" dur="2.943">So with enough training
data, could get really good.</text><text start="707.55" dur="3.303">With enough training data,
could get really good.</text><text start="711.78" dur="0.93">But the thing is,</text><text start="712.71" dur="3.27">they don&amp;#39;t have a ton
of training data yet.</text><text start="715.98" dur="5">So as of right now, they have
made four apps available.</text><text start="721.29" dur="0.833">Four.</text><text start="722.123" dur="1.987">They have this online portal
called the Rabbit Hole,</text><text start="724.11" dur="3.39">where you can log into
and enable all of them.</text><text start="727.5" dur="4.5">Spotify, Uber, DoorDash and Midjourney.</text><text start="732" dur="2.88">So the Rabbit can talk to these four apps,</text><text start="734.88" dur="2.82">and has a UI on the screen for doing so</text><text start="737.7" dur="1.86">in the exact way that we&amp;#39;re theorizing.</text><text start="739.56" dur="1.92">So it&amp;#39;ll play Spotify songs.</text><text start="741.48" dur="1.74">Like I can ask it for a song,</text><text start="743.22" dur="1.71">and it&amp;#39;ll try to play the right one,</text><text start="744.93" dur="3.12">and it&amp;#39;ll show you any info
you need on the touch screen</text><text start="748.05" dur="2.4">to confirm or refine the
actions you&amp;#39;re taking.</text><text start="750.45" dur="2.31">But even now, they kinda work.</text><text start="752.76" dur="1.65">Like, I&amp;#39;ve already had issues with it</text><text start="754.41" dur="1.56">playing the wrong song.</text><text start="755.97" dur="1.86">I&amp;#39;ve also seen other
people already have issues</text><text start="757.83" dur="1.77">with the DoorDash app
getting things wrong,</text><text start="759.6" dur="1.68">which is even more frustrating.</text><text start="761.28" dur="1.92">I can&amp;#39;t imagine how
frustrating the Uber app</text><text start="763.2" dur="1.2">messing up would be.</text><text start="764.4" dur="2.31">It definitely seems like it
needs more training data.</text><text start="766.71" dur="2.28">And that&amp;#39;s just for
these four starting apps.</text><text start="768.99" dur="2.04">Now, Rabbit says they have</text><text start="771.03" dur="3.6">800 different apps trained already,</text><text start="774.63" dur="2.52">but they just haven&amp;#39;t
built a UI for it yet,</text><text start="777.15" dur="2.46">so it&amp;#39;s not available on the Rabbit yet.</text><text start="779.61" dur="2.97">And so that&amp;#39;s still in the works.</text><text start="782.58" dur="1.41">Now they&amp;#39;ve also theoretically</text><text start="783.99" dur="2.67">started working on something
called a generative UI,</text><text start="786.66" dur="1.71">where essentially it can recognize</text><text start="788.37" dur="1.65">what type of app it is,</text><text start="790.02" dur="3.63">and then build a UI for it
so Rabbit doesn&amp;#39;t have to...</text><text start="793.65" dur="2.13">But that&amp;#39;s also still theoretical,</text><text start="795.78" dur="2.52">and also on the roadmap
and still in the works.</text><text start="798.3" dur="1.71">And then if there&amp;#39;s another app or service</text><text start="800.01" dur="2.19">that you want your
Rabbit to be able to do,</text><text start="802.2" dur="1.44">like something for work,</text><text start="803.64" dur="2.88">or something super niche
that you&amp;#39;ve invented,</text><text start="806.52" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;ve talked about
something called &amp;quot;Teach Mode&amp;quot;.</text><text start="809.64" dur="3.48">Which is basically having
the Rabbit watch you</text><text start="813.12" dur="2.94">do what you want it to do
on your mouse and keyboard,</text><text start="816.06" dur="2.04">and then it learns from what you did,</text><text start="818.1" dur="3.57">and can then repeat your
actions later, which is sick.</text><text start="821.67" dur="1.95">Unfortunately, you can probably already</text><text start="823.62" dur="0.833">see where this is going,</text><text start="824.453" dur="3.367">Teach Mode is also not
available as of right now.</text><text start="827.82" dur="1.23">This is something they&amp;#39;re still working on</text><text start="829.05" dur="0.87">vetting and finishing.</text><text start="829.92" dur="3.39">And so that&amp;#39;s just later
this year, also in the works.</text><text start="833.31" dur="1.86">So as of right now,</text><text start="835.17" dur="4.35">this device has none of that stuff,</text><text start="839.52" dur="2.22">just the four kind of half working apps</text><text start="841.74" dur="1.773">that we went over at the beginning.</text><text start="844.5" dur="2.028">What are we doing here?</text><text start="846.528" dur="2.232">(letters clicking)
(soft music)</text><text start="848.76" dur="3.09">Okay, I&amp;#39;m gonna try not
to turn this into a rant,</text><text start="851.85" dur="3.12">but I feel like we need
to acknowledge at least,</text><text start="854.97" dur="2.61">that a lot of these tech companies</text><text start="857.58" dur="3.48">are developing tech kinda backwards.</text><text start="861.06" dur="3.3">Like they&amp;#39;re delivering
such unfinished products,</text><text start="864.36" dur="3.21">that it actually makes them
nearly impossible to review.</text><text start="867.57" dur="1.95">Like, it feels like it used to just be,</text><text start="869.52" dur="2.97">make the thing, and then put it on sale.</text><text start="872.49" dur="2.43">Now it&amp;#39;s like put it on sale,</text><text start="874.92" dur="1.98">and then deliver the half-baked thing,</text><text start="876.9" dur="1.53">and then iterate and make it better,</text><text start="878.43" dur="2.28">and hopefully with enough
updates, then it&amp;#39;s ready,</text><text start="880.71" dur="1.23">and it&amp;#39;s what we promised</text><text start="881.94" dur="1.98">way back when we first started selling it.</text><text start="883.92" dur="2.28">And then this whole period
in the middle is a mess.</text><text start="886.2" dur="2.4">And it&amp;#39;s across all kinds
of product categories too.</text><text start="888.6" dur="1.23">We&amp;#39;ve seen this with gaming.</text><text start="889.83" dur="4.087">Like huge studios are delivering
half-baked games saying,</text><text start="893.917" dur="1.643">&amp;quot;Oh, you know, it&amp;#39;s an alpha version.</text><text start="895.56" dur="1.44">There will be updates.&amp;quot;</text><text start="897" dur="2.67">But meanwhile, it&amp;#39;s a full price AAA game</text><text start="899.67" dur="1.89">that&amp;#39;s just gotten an unacceptable number</text><text start="901.56" dur="1.44">of bugs and issues.</text><text start="903" dur="2.19">It&amp;#39;s also happening with cars.</text><text start="905.19" dur="1.53">And vehicles getting announced,</text><text start="906.72" dur="2.85">and then delivering with
like a half-finished state,</text><text start="909.57" dur="2.31">where you just don&amp;#39;t get
a lot of the features</text><text start="911.88" dur="0.833">that you paid for.</text><text start="912.713" dur="1.897">And they&amp;#39;re eventually coming soon,</text><text start="914.61" dur="1.02">with a software update.</text><text start="915.63" dur="1.08">You know, smartphones, obviously,</text><text start="916.71" dur="1.77">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this for years,</text><text start="918.48" dur="2.28">but it does seem like now more than ever,</text><text start="920.76" dur="2.31">there&amp;#39;s at least one feature,</text><text start="923.07" dur="2.31">one major feature of
every smartphone launch</text><text start="925.38" dur="1.17">that gets announced,</text><text start="926.55" dur="2.43">but that&amp;#39;s not coming
until later in the year.</text><text start="928.98" dur="3.72">And now these AI based
products are at like the apex</text><text start="932.7" dur="2.19">of this horrible trend where,</text><text start="934.89" dur="2.1">the thing that you get at the beginning</text><text start="936.99" dur="2.82">is like borderline nonfunctional</text><text start="939.81" dur="2.52">compared to all the promises
and all the features</text><text start="942.33" dur="3.06">and all the things that it&amp;#39;s
supposed to maybe someday be.</text><text start="945.39" dur="2.22">But you still pay full
price at the beginning,</text><text start="947.61" dur="1.23">which is what makes it so crazy.</text><text start="948.84" dur="1.32">And that sucks not only obviously</text><text start="950.16" dur="2.37">for the people buying it at
full price at the beginning,</text><text start="952.53" dur="2.85">but also for reviewing
these things in general.</text><text start="955.38" dur="3.42">Like, how do you assess a product</text><text start="958.8" dur="4.32">where the version of what&amp;#39;s
promised in like three years,</text><text start="963.12" dur="2.64">what it could be is amazing,</text><text start="965.76" dur="4.14">but the version that&amp;#39;s being
delivered now is dog water.</text><text start="969.9" dur="2.76">Like, how do you connect those dots?</text><text start="972.66" dur="1.29">Do you even connect those dots?</text><text start="973.95" dur="2.34">Are you supposed to give them
the benefit of the doubt?</text><text start="976.29" dur="1.29">I don&amp;#39;t know. What are we even doing here?</text><text start="977.58" dur="1.14">I mean, I guess on one hand,</text><text start="978.72" dur="2.7">it is good that tech products,</text><text start="981.42" dur="2.55">these things can get better
over time and improve,</text><text start="983.97" dur="2.25">and the thing you buy
can be better tomorrow.</text><text start="986.22" dur="0.833">That&amp;#39;s all great.</text><text start="987.053" dur="1.387">That didn&amp;#39;t used to be true,</text><text start="988.44" dur="1.17">and that&amp;#39;s beautiful and everything.</text><text start="989.61" dur="1.74">But on the other hand,</text><text start="991.35" dur="2.01">it&amp;#39;s just, the other side of that coin,</text><text start="993.36" dur="3.99">is some very unfinished
products being delivered,</text><text start="997.35" dur="2.7">and I just feel like it&amp;#39;s gonna get worse</text><text start="1000.05" dur="1.114">before it gets better.</text><text start="1001.164" dur="2.576">(letters clicking)
(tense music)</text><text start="1003.74" dur="1.71">So, let me just say,</text><text start="1005.45" dur="2.58">I am personally very excited</text><text start="1008.03" dur="5">by the idea of a super
personalized AI assistant</text><text start="1013.43" dur="3.3">that can do everything that
a human assistant could.</text><text start="1016.73" dur="1.5">That&amp;#39;s my dream. I want that to happen.</text><text start="1018.23" dur="2.58">And I&amp;#39;m interested that
these different companies</text><text start="1020.81" dur="2.64">are approaching it from different angles.</text><text start="1023.45" dur="2.37">And hopefully, we&amp;#39;ll get there eventually.</text><text start="1025.82" dur="1.98">But this is also so clearly going to take</text><text start="1027.8" dur="4.14">a lot of time and effort
and technical development,</text><text start="1031.94" dur="1.62">and also a lot of data.</text><text start="1033.56" dur="2.64">Like, I&amp;#39;ve said this already
in the Humane review,</text><text start="1036.2" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;m pretty sure, which is a
good assistant needs to know</text><text start="1039.53" dur="2.94">everything about you, whether
it&amp;#39;s human or virtual.</text><text start="1042.47" dur="1.77">Like it needs to know your preferences,</text><text start="1044.24" dur="1.2">and your location,</text><text start="1045.44" dur="1.65">and what you&amp;#39;re doing,
and what you like to do.</text><text start="1047.09" dur="1.53">And every single little thing.</text><text start="1048.62" dur="1.02">It&amp;#39;s so much data.</text><text start="1049.64" dur="1.28">So as for the Rabbit...</text><text start="1052.19" dur="3.12">I think that&amp;#39;s why they focused
on getting the price so low.</text><text start="1055.31" dur="1.53">Like, this stuff is all a tough sell,</text><text start="1056.84" dur="1.11">because you&amp;#39;re taking a gamble</text><text start="1057.95" dur="1.71">on what the product could be someday.</text><text start="1059.66" dur="5">But for the Pin, you have to
drop $700, and $24 every month,</text><text start="1065.57" dur="2.61">on the chance that it
might someday get there.</text><text start="1068.18" dur="1.5">Like that&amp;#39;s a lot of money.</text><text start="1069.68" dur="3.09">But for this cute little thing, 200 bucks.</text><text start="1072.77" dur="2.34">Feels like a much easier
investment to make.</text><text start="1075.11" dur="1.62">A much easier pill to swallow,</text><text start="1076.73" dur="1.53">to just take a gamble on it.</text><text start="1078.26" dur="2.18">And on the off chance it
turns out to be awesome</text><text start="1080.44" dur="2.5">in a couple of years, it&amp;#39;ll
feel like it&amp;#39;s worth it.</text><text start="1082.94" dur="2.79">You know, on the chance
that some of those 800 apps</text><text start="1085.73" dur="1.77">are super useful.</text><text start="1087.5" dur="2.55">Or you know, even though you
already have a smartphone,</text><text start="1090.05" dur="2.13">maybe the Teach Mode lets it do something</text><text start="1092.18" dur="1.05">with a single button press</text><text start="1093.23" dur="1.98">that you could never dream of before,</text><text start="1095.21" dur="1.44">then it could be totally worth it.</text><text start="1096.65" dur="1.8">The whole situation reminds me kind of...</text><text start="1098.45" dur="1.71">If you look back at the beginning</text><text start="1100.16" dur="3.03">of when Tesla started shipping cars</text><text start="1103.19" dur="2.97">with all the autopilot stuff.</text><text start="1106.16" dur="0.9">They were selling cars,</text><text start="1107.06" dur="1.86">and they got popular for other reasons.</text><text start="1108.92" dur="1.74">It was a good electric
car with good range,</text><text start="1110.66" dur="1.44">and a good charging network.</text><text start="1112.1" dur="2.61">And then people started
sort of beta testing</text><text start="1114.71" dur="1.44">this autopilot stuff,</text><text start="1116.15" dur="2.13">and Tesla starts collecting</text><text start="1118.28" dur="2.88">millions of miles and hours of data,</text><text start="1121.16" dur="1.65">from how it works in the real world.</text><text start="1122.81" dur="3.09">And so all of that data
helped their systems learn,</text><text start="1125.9" dur="1.68">and get the head start that they need,</text><text start="1127.58" dur="2.13">on trying to make the
best autopilot software.</text><text start="1129.71" dur="1.5">So the Rabbit, I&amp;#39;m sure,</text><text start="1131.21" dur="1.77">would like to use their price advantage,</text><text start="1132.98" dur="1.11">and get as many of them out</text><text start="1134.09" dur="1.68">into the real world as possible,</text><text start="1135.77" dur="0.93">into people&amp;#39;s hands,</text><text start="1136.7" dur="1.14">so they can start beta testing,</text><text start="1137.84" dur="2.07">and having it trained and getting good</text><text start="1139.91" dur="1.44">at a variety of tasks.</text><text start="1141.35" dur="1.86">But the Rabbit&amp;#39;s problem is,</text><text start="1143.21" dur="2.76">it doesn&amp;#39;t have like the other reason</text><text start="1145.97" dur="2.91">why people would get it anyway today.</text><text start="1148.88" dur="2.19">So it&amp;#39;s like a kind of
chicken and egg problem.</text><text start="1151.07" dur="4.02">So if you want my advice,
you&amp;#39;ve heard it before.</text><text start="1155.09" dur="4.62">Buy the product based on what it is today,</text><text start="1159.71" dur="3.15">and not what it&amp;#39;s promised
