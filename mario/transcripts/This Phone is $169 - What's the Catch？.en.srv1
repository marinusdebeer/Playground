<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.199" dur="2.951">(Intro sounds)</text><text start="3.15" dur="2.64">- This brand new smartphone from 2023</text><text start="5.79" dur="3.75">has a 6 1/2-inch, 90 hertz
display with a hole-punch cutout,</text><text start="9.54" dur="2.85">a 5,000 milliamp-hour
battery, triple cameras,</text><text start="12.39" dur="2.4">a micro SD card slot
for expandable storage,</text><text start="14.79" dur="4.41">a headphone jack, and
water resistance for 169.</text><text start="19.2" dur="1.797">Nice, but what&amp;#39;s the catch?</text><text start="20.997" dur="1.953">There&amp;#39;s gotta be a catch, right?</text><text start="22.95" dur="2.16">So look, I&amp;#39;ve said it before
and I&amp;#39;ll say it again.</text><text start="25.11" dur="2.76">Good phones are getting cheap, nuh,</text><text start="27.87" dur="2.61">and cheap phones are getting good.</text><text start="30.48" dur="1.92">And this video is gonna focus
on the second part of that,</text><text start="32.4" dur="2.19">which is the cheap phones
that are getting so good,</text><text start="34.59" dur="1.47">because this phone hit my inbox recently.</text><text start="36.06" dur="3">It&amp;#39;s called the Moto G Play
for 2023 and if you&amp;#39;ve been</text><text start="39.06" dur="2.52">paying attention to what
Motorola&amp;#39;s been doing recently,</text><text start="41.58" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;ve been making a lot
of really good budget phones</text><text start="44.22" dur="1.8">in the background for
the past couple years.</text><text start="46.02" dur="2.79">I just wanted to know,
personally, from using it myself,</text><text start="48.81" dur="3.54">how do you end up at a phone
that&amp;#39;s a 10th of the price</text><text start="52.35" dur="1.71">of the ones that I&amp;#39;ve
been really enjoying?</text><text start="54.06" dur="1.92">So on the outside, well,
it&amp;#39;s a pretty big phone,</text><text start="55.98" dur="3.18">which I like, and there&amp;#39;s
actually a 6.5 inch flat</text><text start="59.16" dur="2.07">90 hertz LCD display.</text><text start="61.23" dur="2.13">Now it&amp;#39;s not the best-looking
screen you&amp;#39;ve ever seen.</text><text start="63.36" dur="3.39">It&amp;#39;s only 720P, so I can
literally see pixels sometimes,</text><text start="66.75" dur="1.47">and it doesn&amp;#39;t get very bright, you know,</text><text start="68.22" dur="2.4">viewing angles are pretty
bad if you get off axis.</text><text start="70.62" dur="1.38">And of course, the bezels you can see</text><text start="72" dur="2.58">are slightly thicker,
especially in the chin.</text><text start="74.58" dur="2.01">And there&amp;#39;s this little
bit of light fall off</text><text start="76.59" dur="1.5">around the hole-punch camera at the top.</text><text start="78.09" dur="3.39">But the thing is, can you
really pixel peep at this price?</text><text start="81.48" dur="2.55">Like this is plenty of screen for texting,</text><text start="84.03" dur="2.64">web browsing, navigation,
flipping through apps,</text><text start="86.67" dur="1.17">scrolling through social media,</text><text start="87.84" dur="1.74">the classic stuff you wanna do on a phone.</text><text start="89.58" dur="2.19">Mission accomplished, you
know, it&amp;#39;s a big screen,</text><text start="91.77" dur="1.62">so that&amp;#39;s not the catch.</text><text start="93.39" dur="1.74">But what about the build?</text><text start="95.13" dur="2.07">You&amp;#39;ve probably picked up
that it&amp;#39;s a pretty big phone</text><text start="97.2" dur="2.804">but it&amp;#39;s also made of plastic.</text><text start="100.004" dur="2.806">But honestly, the layout
is perfectly fine.</text><text start="102.81" dur="2.04">Like you&amp;#39;ve got the port and
the speakers at the bottom,</text><text start="104.85" dur="1.95">there&amp;#39;s a headphone jack at the top,</text><text start="106.8" dur="1.83">and you have bonus expandable storage</text><text start="108.63" dur="2.22">alongside the SIM card tray
right where it belongs.</text><text start="110.85" dur="3.99">And on the back, yes, that is
a decently-fast fingerprint</text><text start="114.84" dur="3.21">reader right in that classic
Motorola dimple spot.</text><text start="118.05" dur="3.09">So it&amp;#39;s laid out well, it
absolutely does not bend</text><text start="121.14" dur="1.95">or creep or anything weird like that.</text><text start="123.09" dur="2.91">Plus you might have heard
plastic is absolutely not the end</text><text start="126" dur="2.22">of the world when it comes
to a smartphone build.</text><text start="128.22" dur="3">Obviously the premium ones
will really like to feel</text><text start="131.22" dur="3.33">more premium and heavy
and so glass will do that.</text><text start="134.55" dur="2.85">But this is often more durable
than glass if you drop it.</text><text start="137.4" dur="1.68">And some people like
a lighter-weight phone</text><text start="139.08" dur="0.84">when it is this big.</text><text start="139.92" dur="3.63">Also, it is still water resistant.</text><text start="143.55" dur="2.58">I can&amp;#39;t say waterproof, it&amp;#39;s IP52,</text><text start="146.13" dur="1.08">but it&amp;#39;s water resistant.</text><text start="147.21" dur="2.64">So the build, that&amp;#39;s not the catch.</text><text start="149.85" dur="1.26">So, okay, what about the battery,</text><text start="151.11" dur="2.67">you might be wondering,
Cheap phone, it&amp;#39;s excellent,</text><text start="153.78" dur="3.96">perfectly unironically not
exaggerating, it&amp;#39;s excellent,</text><text start="157.74" dur="2.28">which actually shouldn&amp;#39;t be
a surprise given the spec.</text><text start="160.02" dur="2.07">It&amp;#39;s a 5,000 milliamp-hour battery</text><text start="162.09" dur="2.43">powering a phone with a 720p display.</text><text start="164.52" dur="3.42">So you&amp;#39;re good for a day and
a half easy, two light days</text><text start="167.94" dur="2.07">is no problem with seven
hours of screen on time.</text><text start="170.01" dur="2.4">Now it&amp;#39;s only up to 10 watt charging,</text><text start="172.41" dur="2.7">which is pretty slow and
there is no wireless charging,</text><text start="175.11" dur="2.34">but I&amp;#39;m not gonna consider
that a gotcha at this price.</text><text start="177.45" dur="1.56">Again, it&amp;#39;s like you can just</text><text start="179.01" dur="1.38">charge it up overnight every night</text><text start="180.39" dur="2.64">like a normal person and
battery life will be fine.</text><text start="183.03" dur="1.8">And even the software is really good.</text><text start="184.83" dur="2.01">It&amp;#39;s virtually the same experience</text><text start="186.84" dur="3.15">as their $1000 flagship
Edge phone, which is to say,</text><text start="189.99" dur="2.34">near stock Android with a little Moto</text><text start="192.33" dur="1.74">extra features sprinkled on top.</text><text start="194.07" dur="2.1">So at its most basic, it&amp;#39;ll kind of feel</text><text start="196.17" dur="2.34">like a Pixel when you dig
through like quick settings</text><text start="198.51" dur="1.62">and notifications and the launcher,</text><text start="200.13" dur="2.37">but then you get some Motorola
widgets tucked in, you know,</text><text start="202.5" dur="2.07">you get a couple extra
settings in the settings app,</text><text start="204.57" dur="1.77">but then you get this
Moto app that lets you</text><text start="206.34" dur="2.22">dig into your extra gestures and features</text><text start="208.56" dur="1.44">that they&amp;#39;ve perfected over the years.</text><text start="210" dur="1.83">The double chop for the flashlight,</text><text start="211.83" dur="2.97">the three finger screenshot,
you know, the peek display</text><text start="214.8" dur="2.25">feature that gives you a peek
at your new notifications</text><text start="217.05" dur="2.37">and even swiping down on
your notification panel</text><text start="219.42" dur="2.04">from the fingerprint reader on the back.</text><text start="221.46" dur="2.76">Basically, everything
minus the double twist</text><text start="224.22" dur="3">to quickly open the camera,
probably because the camera is</text><text start="227.22" dur="2.64">not one of those things that
you really look forward to</text><text start="229.86" dur="1.8">on these super cheap phones.</text><text start="231.66" dur="2.04">Oh wow, look at the light
fall off, you can see it</text><text start="233.7" dur="2.01">on camera, but either
way, I&amp;#39;m happy to report</text><text start="235.71" dur="3.54">that this camera is
functional, which is like,</text><text start="239.25" dur="1.47">that&amp;#39;s what you would
hope for at this price,</text><text start="240.72" dur="2.25">which is, yeah, it&amp;#39;s functional.</text><text start="242.97" dur="2.16">I&amp;#39;m just not a huge fan of
the triple camera layout here.</text><text start="245.13" dur="1.86">Like I know they&amp;#39;re trying to look premium</text><text start="246.99" dur="2.67">and triple cameras looks
premium, but the top one</text><text start="249.66" dur="2.52">is a two-megapixel macro
camera and the bottom one</text><text start="252.18" dur="2.37">is a two-megapixel depth
camera for portrait mode.</text><text start="254.55" dur="2.88">So I&amp;#39;m mainly just looking for
this main 16-megapixel camera</text><text start="257.43" dur="2.64">to be able to capture
scenes, documents, you know,</text><text start="260.07" dur="1.77">take photos and videos without problems.</text><text start="261.84" dur="2.22">And it does, especially if
you give it enough light.</text><text start="264.06" dur="2.4">It&amp;#39;s not gonna win any comparison
tests, that&amp;#39;s for sure.</text><text start="266.46" dur="2.49">But hey, we ask a lot of
our phones, like the fact</text><text start="268.95" dur="3.87">that this $169 gadget can
already make phone calls</text><text start="272.82" dur="3.21">and send text messages and
navigate you around the world</text><text start="276.03" dur="2.52">and also play games
and also browse the web</text><text start="278.55" dur="1.68">and it can also take decent pictures</text><text start="280.23" dur="2.73">and 1080p videos and that&amp;#39;s solid.</text><text start="282.96" dur="1.77">I initially had my suspicions
about whether or not</text><text start="284.73" dur="2.58">it was going to actually
use this depth camera</text><text start="287.31" dur="2.67">when I take a portrait-mode
photo, but it did yell at me</text><text start="289.98" dur="2.76">when I covered it and tried
to take a portrait-mode shot,</text><text start="292.74" dur="2.55">so it&amp;#39;s paying attention to it, at least.</text><text start="295.29" dur="2.76">But when I took the photo and
turned up the background blur,</text><text start="298.05" dur="3.51">this is the cutout shape
which, if you zoom in</text><text start="301.56" dur="2.67">just a little bit, is truly bizarre.</text><text start="304.23" dur="1.2">It&amp;#39;s really bad.</text><text start="305.43" dur="2.807">I&amp;#39;ve never seen anything
this bad in my life.</text><text start="308.237" dur="1.783">(chuckles) They really just
said, &amp;quot;Yeah, we&amp;#39;ll just save</text><text start="310.02" dur="2.46">a little processing power
here and use the zigzag cutout</text><text start="312.48" dur="1.86">method from those scissors from preschool</text><text start="314.34" dur="0.833">to make this work.&amp;quot;</text><text start="315.173" dur="1.267">But see, that&amp;#39;s the thing.</text><text start="316.44" dur="1.74">That is the catch.</text><text start="318.18" dur="2.07">It&amp;#39;s not the build quality, that&amp;#39;s fine,</text><text start="320.25" dur="2.85">and it&amp;#39;s definitely not the
battery life, that&amp;#39;s great.</text><text start="323.1" dur="3.42">It&amp;#39;s not the cameras and it&amp;#39;s
certainly not the software.</text><text start="326.52" dur="3.84">It&amp;#39;s that this phone is slow, really slow.</text><text start="330.36" dur="4.35">So this phone has a MediaTek
Helio G37 chip inside</text><text start="334.71" dur="1.32">and three gigabytes of RAM.</text><text start="336.03" dur="3.54">Other phones with this chip
set include the Techno Spark 9,</text><text start="339.57" dur="3.63">the Infinix Hot 12, and the HONOR X7a,</text><text start="343.2" dur="2.61">all of which retail well under $150 US.</text><text start="345.81" dur="2.22">So clearly it&amp;#39;s a cheap chip, right,</text><text start="348.03" dur="1.53">and that&amp;#39;s how it ended up in this phone.</text><text start="349.56" dur="1.65">For some context, the Geekbench score</text><text start="351.21" dur="3">of the iPhone 14 is this,
and the Geekbench score</text><text start="354.21" dur="1.86">of the Moto G Play is this.</text><text start="356.07" dur="2.73">So when I say it&amp;#39;s trying
to save processing power</text><text start="358.8" dur="2.37">by not really doing
detailed portrait cutouts,</text><text start="361.17" dur="2.49">I actually mean that,
like it absolutely lacks</text><text start="363.66" dur="1.41">any meaningful processing power.</text><text start="365.07" dur="1.44">And I&amp;#39;m not nitpicking about like maybe</text><text start="366.51" dur="2.64">it&amp;#39;s just slow on some
high-end games or something.</text><text start="369.15" dur="1.8">No, this phone is slow all the time.</text><text start="370.95" dur="3.51">It&amp;#39;s slow to scroll and just
like move around the UI.</text><text start="374.46" dur="1.26">Now remember I mentioned at the beginning</text><text start="375.72" dur="2.67">that this phone has a
variable 90 hertz display</text><text start="378.39" dur="2.4">but I&amp;#39;ll be honest, it would&amp;#39;ve
taken me a while to tell</text><text start="380.79" dur="3.51">because it is almost never
anywhere near 60 hertz.</text><text start="384.3" dur="2.52">It&amp;#39;s constantly hanging up
and stuttering everywhere.</text><text start="386.82" dur="3.207">It&amp;#39;s slow to unlock,
it&amp;#39;s slow to open apps,</text><text start="390.027" dur="2.853">not not just huge apps, just normal apps.</text><text start="392.88" dur="2.91">Even the settings apps takes
an embarrassingly long time</text><text start="395.79" dur="2.67">to open and even longer
to search through things.</text><text start="398.46" dur="2.67">Some of this is like speed of
storage as well, to be fair.</text><text start="401.13" dur="1.38">So I don&amp;#39;t wanna put it all on the chip,</text><text start="402.51" dur="3.24">but like the point here is
it&amp;#39;s absolutely the catch.</text><text start="405.75" dur="2.49">This phone is slower than
average to take pictures.</text><text start="408.24" dur="2.4">It&amp;#39;s slow to type stuff, to browse around,</text><text start="410.64" dur="2.22">and just to do anything
like high-end gaming</text><text start="412.86" dur="1.98">or photo editing is kind
of out of the question.</text><text start="414.84" dur="1.98">It might be the slowest
phone I&amp;#39;ve ever used</text><text start="416.82" dur="2.1">and I&amp;#39;m constantly reminded of it,</text><text start="418.92" dur="1.89">which can make it quite unpleasant to use.</text><text start="420.81" dur="1.89">So the longer I use this
phone, the more it had me</text><text start="422.7" dur="2.85">thinking about one big question, which is,</text><text start="425.55" dur="3.93">is it better to get a brand
new cheap phone like this</text><text start="429.48" dur="4.35">or an older, formerly
expensive flagship one.</text><text start="433.83" dur="2.4">Like this phone, this
is 169 brand new, right?</text><text start="436.23" dur="3.18">This phone here, this
is the OnePlus 7 Pro,</text><text start="439.41" dur="0.833">you might remember it.</text><text start="440.243" dur="1.117">It&amp;#39;s one of my favorite phones ever.</text><text start="441.36" dur="2.91">This was the phone of the year in 2019.</text><text start="444.27" dur="3.39">So this was 669 back when it
came out, but it can be had</text><text start="447.66" dur="3">easily for well under
$200 right now secondhand.</text><text start="450.66" dur="2.4">So this is just one example
of a phone like this.</text><text start="453.06" dur="1.92">This phone, if you
compare dollar for dollar</text><text start="454.98" dur="3.51">with the Moto is just so
much better of an experience</text><text start="458.49" dur="2.22">across the board, obviously it&amp;#39;ll have</text><text start="460.71" dur="1.11">a much better chip set.</text><text start="461.82" dur="2.58">So the Snapdragon 855 is a few years old,</text><text start="464.4" dur="3.06">but it&amp;#39;s much more capable and
part of an overall smoother,</text><text start="467.46" dur="3.36">better performance profile with
faster storage and more RAM.</text><text start="470.82" dur="3.03">It has a much, much nicer OLED screen,</text><text start="473.85" dur="2.49">which is sharper,
brighter, and actually hits</text><text start="476.34" dur="1.95">the 90 hertz refresh rate all the time.</text><text start="478.29" dur="2.22">It has way more built-in
storage, although it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="480.51" dur="2.43">expandable, and it has a
much better set of cameras.</text><text start="482.94" dur="2.64">It&amp;#39;s a primary plus an
ultra wide and a zoom,</text><text start="485.58" dur="1.68">and it&amp;#39;s built from
glass instead of plastic,</text><text start="487.26" dur="3.42">which feels rock solid, and
it has a 4,000 milliamp hour</text><text start="490.68" dur="2.28">battery, which is probably
the only hardware line</text><text start="492.96" dur="2.19">you can call it a draw or maybe even a win</text><text start="495.15" dur="2.28">for the Moto phone, but we
can&amp;#39;t forget that warp charging</text><text start="497.43" dur="1.29">that OnePlus was famous for.</text><text start="498.72" dur="3.36">So this old flagship will do
30 watts of wired charging.</text><text start="502.08" dur="2.52">So it&amp;#39;s seeming pretty unanimous here.</text><text start="504.6" dur="3.54">But one distinct advantage
of the budget phone is</text><text start="508.14" dur="3.87">because it&amp;#39;s new, it
will get software updates</text><text start="512.01" dur="2.94">further into the future
than the old phone.</text><text start="514.95" dur="2.91">Now this is theoretically, of
course, like Motorola does not</text><text start="517.86" dur="1.41">have the best track record here,</text><text start="519.27" dur="2.311">so it depends on what
phone we&amp;#39;re talking about,</text><text start="521.581" dur="2.939">but the Samsung A14 5G, for
example, has a pretty similar</text><text start="524.52" dur="2.52">spec sheet and a similar price
point, and that&amp;#39;ll probably</text><text start="527.04" dur="1.68">get more software updates than the Moto.</text><text start="528.72" dur="2.34">But the idea here is
even if a flagship phone</text><text start="531.06" dur="2.94">is promised three to four
years of software updates,</text><text start="534" dur="2.94">and the budget phone is only
getting two, as soon as that</text><text start="536.94" dur="2.1">flagship phone is more
than about three years old,</text><text start="539.04" dur="1.8">it doesn&amp;#39;t have that advantage anymore.</text><text start="540.84" dur="2.43">So the OnePlus 7 Pro
is probably about done</text><text start="543.27" dur="1.68">with software updates
while we probably have</text><text start="544.95" dur="1.47">a few in the tank for the Moto.</text><text start="546.42" dur="1.92">It is also funny though,
sometimes, how I hear people</text><text start="548.34" dur="3.09">talk about software updates,
like some people don&amp;#39;t think</text><text start="551.43" dur="4.11">about software updates at all,
they avoid software updates.</text><text start="555.54" dur="1.35">Don&amp;#39;t do that, by the way;</text><text start="556.89" dur="2.31">the security patches are
actually pretty important.</text><text start="559.2" dur="1.41">But yeah, it&amp;#39;s just one of those points</text><text start="560.61" dur="2.67">that has to, by default,
go to the newer phone.</text><text start="563.28" dur="3.12">But the final straw in
favor of the older phone</text><text start="566.4" dur="1.92">is actually the environment.</text><text start="568.32" dur="3.18">Just because buying an older
phone that&amp;#39;s built to last</text><text start="571.5" dur="3.15">and getting an extra 2, 3, 4
years out of it potentially</text><text start="574.65" dur="1.68">is better for the environment overall.</text><text start="576.33" dur="3">You buy less new things,
it&amp;#39;s less e-waste.</text><text start="579.33" dur="2.04">So that&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s
a feather in the cap</text><text start="581.37" dur="2.4">of the old phone over the new one.</text><text start="583.77" dur="2.22">So my general thought as
I&amp;#39;ve looked at this landscape</text><text start="585.99" dur="3.15">and all these options with old flagships</text><text start="589.14" dur="2.19">versus new budget phones is</text><text start="591.33" dur="3.54">the lower the price of the
phone, the more I would</text><text start="594.87" dur="2.76">actually want to buy the older phone.</text><text start="597.63" dur="2.58">So at 169, for example, based
on the experience I&amp;#39;ve had</text><text start="600.21" dur="2.25">with this phone, I would
definitely rather have,</text><text start="602.46" dur="1.53">actually, the older flagship phone.</text><text start="603.99" dur="2.76">There&amp;#39;s a lot of flagships you
can get at about 200 bucks,</text><text start="606.75" dur="2.82">you could get this one,
you could get a Pixel 5.</text><text start="609.57" dur="1.62">Secondhand phones are really good.</text><text start="611.19" dur="2.67">Now if you go up to like 400 bucks,</text><text start="613.86" dur="1.44">then it&amp;#39;s a little more debatable.</text><text start="615.3" dur="2.31">There&amp;#39;s still some things
that would still point me</text><text start="617.61" dur="2.73">towards the formerly flagship
phone, but then you get</text><text start="620.34" dur="2.55">to like 600 bucks and it&amp;#39;s
like, oh, there&amp;#39;s really good</text><text start="622.89" dur="2.52">brand new $600 phones
that I would take today</text><text start="625.41" dur="2.73">and still have the advantages
of the software updates.</text><text start="628.14" dur="3.21">It&amp;#39;s not a lot that&amp;#39;s better
than the Pixel 7, right now.</text><text start="631.35" dur="0.833">So that&amp;#39;s the theory.
(brass fanfare blaring)</text><text start="632.183" dur="0.907">So there you have it.</text><text start="633.09" dur="5">At this price point, I&amp;#39;d
prefer prehistoric premium</text><text start="638.52" dur="2.853">over presently pleasantly priced.</text><text start="642.3" dur="1.38">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="643.68" dur="2.34">Talk to you guys in the next one, peace.</text><text start="646.02" dur="1.917">(brassy music continues)</text><text start="647.937" dur="3.993">Pleasantly presently, that&amp;#39;s a lot.</text><text start="651.93" dur="3.213">Pleasantly, presently, pleasantly priced?</text></transcript>
