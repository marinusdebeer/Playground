of the Apple Watch lineup</text><text start="8.16" dur="2.73">for an extra premium
price, kinda as an excuse</text><text start="10.89" dur="1.86">to pack a much bigger
battery in a smartwatch,</text><text start="12.75" dur="2.61">but also, to offer a few
extra ruggedized features</text><text start="15.36" dur="3.75">for enthusiasts willing
to spend the extra money.</text><text start="19.11" dur="4.883">Now, this is the Samsung
Galaxy Watch Ultra,</text><text start="25.08" dur="2.85">and it was added to the top
of the Galaxy Watch lineup</text><text start="27.93" dur="2.73">for an extra premium
price, kinda as an excuse</text><text start="30.66" dur="2.19">to pack a much bigger
battery into a smartwatch,</text><text start="32.85" dur="2.643">but also to offer a few
extra ruggedized features</text><text start="35.493" dur="3.177">for enthusiasts willing
to spend the money.</text><text start="38.67" dur="2.7">Now look, there have
been many copies before,</text><text start="41.37" dur="1.11">in both directions.</text><text start="42.48" dur="2.25">Like, Samsung copies Apple all the time,</text><text start="44.73" dur="2.37">and Apple copies Samsung all the time.</text><text start="47.1" dur="2.855">But this one is so far</text><text start="49.955" dur="2.845">that it&amp;#39;s hard to ignore.</text><text start="52.8" dur="1.32">So, there&amp;#39;s been a lot of chatter online,</text><text start="54.12" dur="2.25">about how the New Galaxy Watch Ultra</text><text start="56.37" dur="3.15">is a copycat product of
the Apple Watch Ultra.</text><text start="59.52" dur="2.43">And yeah, it&amp;#39;s true, it really is.</text><text start="61.95" dur="1.98">But I&amp;#39;ve said this before
and I&amp;#39;ll say it again.</text><text start="63.93" dur="0.942">I actually don&amp;#39;t care</text><text start="64.872" dur="3.468">that these products and
companies copy each other.</text><text start="68.34" dur="2.04">As long as they&amp;#39;re copying the good stuff,</text><text start="70.38" dur="3.84">then, us as customers,
we actually still win.</text><text start="74.22" dur="2.115">This one copied so many things</text><text start="76.335" dur="2.295">that it actually went slightly too far</text><text start="78.63" dur="3.63">and copied one extra thing
that I think hurt its case.</text><text start="82.26" dur="2.132">So, let&amp;#39;s just go down the list.</text><text start="84.392" dur="2.322">So, first of all, obviously
they had the same name,</text><text start="86.714" dur="1.576">and the whole idea of the product,</text><text start="88.29" dur="1.11">as I mentioned before,</text><text start="89.4" dur="1.53">this is the Watch Ultra.</text><text start="90.93" dur="3.03">It&amp;#39;s at the top of the lineup,
it&amp;#39;s the most expensive,</text><text start="93.96" dur="1.2">and of course, they&amp;#39;ve matched</text><text start="95.16" dur="2.46">the Apple Watch Ultra&amp;#39;s durability specs,</text><text start="97.62" dur="1.809">so they&amp;#39;re both made of titanium,</text><text start="99.429" dur="3.171">they&amp;#39;re both water-resistant
to 100 meters,</text><text start="102.6" dur="3">they both have sapphire glass
over their cover displays.</text><text start="105.6" dur="1.98">And then, the other basic on-paper specs,</text><text start="107.58" dur="3.27">like they both have dual-frequency
GPS for high accuracy,</text><text start="110.85" dur="1.86">they both have extra bright displays</text><text start="112.71" dur="1.02">for visibility outdoors,</text><text start="113.73" dur="1.53">actually both 3,000 nits,</text><text start="115.26" dur="2.49">and then they both have
three default bands.</text><text start="117.75" dur="3.36">So, the Apple Watch
Ultra has an Ocean Band,</text><text start="121.11" dur="2.76">a Trail Loop, and an Alpine Band.</text><text start="123.87" dur="2.88">So now, along comes Samsung&amp;#39;s Watch Ultra,</text><text start="126.75" dur="2.154">and they launch with three bands.</text><text start="128.904" dur="1.776">They don&amp;#39;t have an Ocean Band though,</text><text start="130.68" dur="3.706">they have a Marine
Band, totally different.</text><text start="134.386" dur="3.404">And then they have a Trail Band,</text><text start="137.79" dur="2.01">and then they have this Peakform Band.</text><text start="139.8" dur="2.04">So yeah, the Ocean Band
and the Marine Band</text><text start="141.84" dur="2.73">are kinda like, &amp;quot;Hey,
can I copy your homework,</text><text start="144.57" dur="1.187">but change it up just a little bit</text><text start="145.757" dur="2.593">so it&amp;#39;s not too obvious that I copied?&amp;quot;</text><text start="148.35" dur="2.13">And they kinda didn&amp;#39;t change it up enough.</text><text start="150.48" dur="1.32">But it&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;Okay,
yeah, sweet, thanks.&amp;quot;</text><text start="151.8" dur="2.34">Now we have two holes
on ours instead of one,</text><text start="154.14" dur="2.614">and everybody knows not every
marine is an ocean, duh.</text><text start="156.754" dur="1.322">But each watch has three buttons,</text><text start="158.076" dur="2.244">and you may remember the Apple Watch</text><text start="160.32" dur="1.92">added this special
orange button on the side</text><text start="162.24" dur="1.23">called the Action Button,</text><text start="163.47" dur="2.22">that you could map to any
number of different things.</text><text start="165.69" dur="2.64">But it starts with a
workout selector by default.</text><text start="168.33" dur="2.01">Now, the Galaxy Watch Ultra comes along,</text><text start="170.34" dur="2.31">has a new orange button on the side.</text><text start="172.65" dur="2.4">This one is called the Quick Button,</text><text start="175.05" dur="1.63">and it can be also custom mapped</text><text start="176.68" dur="3.126">to any number of different actions,</text><text start="179.806" dur="2.744">but the default again,
is a workout selector.</text><text start="182.55" dur="1.41">Now, don&amp;#39;t worry, it keeps going.</text><text start="183.96" dur="1.08">In the software department,</text><text start="185.04" dur="1.83">they also lifted a whole bunch of stuff.</text><text start="186.87" dur="3.57">So, this watch face that we
keep seeing Samsung using</text><text start="190.44" dur="2.43">in all of their flagship
marketing for this thing,</text><text start="192.87" dur="3.18">with all the complications
around the outside corners,</text><text start="196.05" dur="1.5">definitely takes heavy inspiration</text><text start="197.55" dur="1.663">from Apple&amp;#39;s flagship watch face</text><text start="199.213" dur="1.517">with the complications everywhere.</text><text start="200.73" dur="2.185">It also has an all monochrome
version for Night Mode,</text><text start="202.915" dur="3.035">which was also new to
the Apple Watch Ultra.</text><text start="205.95" dur="1.41">And if you wanna change the watch face,</text><text start="207.36" dur="1.08">they both have the same mechanic.</text><text start="208.44" dur="2.34">Just hold down the face for a second,</text><text start="210.78" dur="3.24">and then swipe over and you
can customize the complications</text><text start="214.02" dur="1.695">or watch faces from there.</text><text start="215.715" dur="1.818">They both use a blob of icons</text><text start="217.533" dur="3.117">to scroll through all of your apps,</text><text start="220.65" dur="1.443">and even the double-pinch gesture.</text><text start="222.093" dur="2.217">So, this is something
Apple recently added.</text><text start="224.31" dur="2.97">It was in beta at first
and now it&amp;#39;s operational,</text><text start="227.28" dur="1.92">and Samsung&amp;#39;s added it now too.</text><text start="229.2" dur="2.25">It&amp;#39;s off by default,
but when I turn it on,</text><text start="231.45" dur="1.641">it does the exact same things.</text><text start="233.091" dur="2.679">So yeah, as you can tell,
there&amp;#39;s no shortage of things</text><text start="235.77" dur="2.43">that Samsung has lifted
from the Apple Watch Ultra.</text><text start="238.2" dur="1.191">People are calling it shameless,</text><text start="239.391" dur="3.579">people are calling it
pure copycat behavior.</text><text start="242.97" dur="2.34">There&amp;#39;s endless comments online about it.</text><text start="245.31" dur="1.77">Here&amp;#39;s the thing though,</text><text start="247.08" dur="2.726">there&amp;#39;s only one thing that Samsung copied</text><text start="249.806" dur="3.394">that I actually have a
problem with with this watch.</text><text start="253.2" dur="1.77">Like, when you just look at this watch,</text><text start="254.97" dur="1.821">you can definitely argue it actually looks</text><text start="256.791" dur="2.649">mostly different from the Apple Watch.</text><text start="259.44" dur="1.71">I mean I know they both
have the orange button,</text><text start="261.15" dur="1.89">but they&amp;#39;ve done this kinda unique thing,</text><text start="263.04" dur="1.816">where it&amp;#39;s still a fully
circular watch face,</text><text start="264.856" dur="2.264">but then it&amp;#39;s a much bigger, brawny,</text><text start="267.12" dur="1.875">circle-shaped titanium body underneath,</text><text start="268.995" dur="1.815">I call it a cushion design.</text><text start="270.81" dur="1.38">That&amp;#39;s at least different.</text><text start="272.19" dur="1.5">And I don&amp;#39;t know if I
actually like it more,</text><text start="273.69" dur="3.837">but it feels definitively bigger
than the Apple Watch Ultra,</text><text start="277.527" dur="1.743">which was already pretty big.</text><text start="279.27" dur="3">But in the grand scheme of
watches, it&amp;#39;s not actually huge,</text><text start="282.27" dur="1.38">especially &amp;#39;cause the size of the screen</text><text start="283.65" dur="2.37">is basically the same as a large Watch7.</text><text start="286.02" dur="3.54">Anyway, I thought that with
keeping this circular screen,</text><text start="289.56" dur="2.586">they would have a
physically rotating bezel,</text><text start="292.146" dur="2.334">like a clicking bezel on the outside,</text><text start="294.48" dur="4.11">because that was the sickest
feature on the Watch6 Classic,</text><text start="298.59" dur="1.5">and it&amp;#39;s the feature everyone wanted</text><text start="300.09" dur="3.21">in all the other watches,
but they just didn&amp;#39;t do it.</text><text start="303.3" dur="4.68">This watch though, is just pure
touchscreen for everything,</text><text start="307.98" dur="2.58">which might not seem like
that big of a deal at first,</text><text start="310.56" dur="1.905">but again, this is a
watch for fitness people</text><text start="312.465" dur="2.265">doing a lot of workouts
and things like that,</text><text start="314.73" dur="2.04">and if you&amp;#39;ve used watches</text><text start="316.77" dur="2.7">in all these workout situations
before, then you know,</text><text start="319.47" dur="1.95">like there are endless
situations where like,</text><text start="321.42" dur="3.27">sweat or your sleeve is
messing with the touchscreen,</text><text start="324.69" dur="1.98">or if you&amp;#39;ve got gloves on,</text><text start="326.67" dur="1.987">or if you&amp;#39;re hiking or you&amp;#39;re
underwater or swimming,</text><text start="328.657" dur="2.963">whatever, there&amp;#39;s just plenty of chances</text><text start="331.62" dur="1.89">for the touchscreen to suck.</text><text start="333.51" dur="2.33">So, the rotating crown
to use as a selector</text><text start="335.84" dur="1.81">to mess with the watch,</text><text start="337.65" dur="2.607">would have been a banger differentiator</text><text start="340.257" dur="3.663">for this fitness watch
versus the Apple Watch Ultra,</text><text start="343.92" dur="1.8">but they didn&amp;#39;t do it.</text><text start="345.72" dur="3.277">Now, I&amp;#39;m guessing, if you
asked Samsung, they would say,</text><text start="348.997" dur="1.793">&amp;quot;No rotating bezel on this watch,</text><text start="350.79" dur="1.485">because that&amp;#39;s a moving part,</text><text start="352.275" dur="1.605">and that wouldn&amp;#39;t have held up</text><text start="353.88" dur="1.977">to the military-grade certification</text><text start="355.857" dur="1.353">of the rest of the watch.&amp;quot;</text><text start="357.21" dur="4.188">Like, it&amp;#39;s got this 810H
grade military certification,</text><text start="361.398" dur="3.219">where it&amp;#39;s like, it can
withstand even tougher drops,</text><text start="364.617" dur="1.341">and like more dust</text><text start="365.958" dur="2.562">and wider range of temperatures
and all that stuff,</text><text start="368.52" dur="2.34">so, the moving part wouldn&amp;#39;t
have worked with that.</text><text start="370.86" dur="3.57">But honestly, Samsung, I
think just do it anyway.</text><text start="374.43" dur="1.62">Just go with the rotating bezel.</text><text start="376.05" dur="1.117">I think 99% of users</text><text start="377.167" dur="3.893">would rather have the rotating bezel</text><text start="381.06" dur="2.85">over the military certification,</text><text start="383.91" dur="1.566">and the 1% who don&amp;#39;t like,</text><text start="385.476" dur="2.634">they&amp;#39;ll get a Garmin or
whatever, something different,</text><text start="388.11" dur="1.65">but I think this is something</text><text start="389.76" dur="2.19">that would&amp;#39;ve actually been a great match</text><text start="391.95" dur="1.35">with this particular watch.</text><text start="393.3" dur="2.1">Now, there&amp;#39;s a few other
things now that I&amp;#39;ve used it</text><text start="395.4" dur="2.31">that do differentiate this watch too.</text><text start="397.71" dur="1.29">Obviously, it&amp;#39;s gonna
be the one that works</text><text start="399" dur="2.76">with Android phones and not
iPhones, that&amp;#39;s number one.</text><text start="401.76" dur="2.13">But where OS performs really well,</text><text start="403.89" dur="1.32">I know there was some early concerns</text><text start="405.21" dur="2.52">about it not being super
smooth, but it&amp;#39;s been great.</text><text start="407.73" dur="2.79">It&amp;#39;s very customizable, very functional.</text><text start="410.52" dur="1.44">The full-size keyboard</text><text start="411.96" dur="2.084">is actually a bit easier to type on,</text><text start="414.044" dur="1.816">despite having a bigger screen,</text><text start="415.86" dur="1.62">because they make the letters bigger,</text><text start="417.48" dur="2.67">and then you have to go into
a secondary menu for symbols.</text><text start="420.15" dur="1.41">But I actually feel like I can type words</text><text start="421.56" dur="2.58">pretty well on this versus
other smart watches.</text><text start="424.14" dur="1.043">And I think best of all,</text><text start="425.183" dur="3.727">the battery life has actually
lived up to its claims.</text><text start="428.91" dur="2.995">So, sometimes it&amp;#39;s hard to know
what to make of the 60 hours</text><text start="431.905" dur="2.915">versus 100 hours in Power-Saving Mode,</text><text start="434.82" dur="2.37">or 48 hours in Exercise Power-Saving Mode.</text><text start="437.19" dur="1.894">It&amp;#39;s kind of confusing,
but what I will say is,</text><text start="439.084" dur="2.32">it matched and sometimes beat</text><text start="441.404" dur="2.716">the battery life of the Apple Watch Ultra,</text><text start="444.12" dur="1.14">like pretty regularly.</text><text start="445.26" dur="3.702">I felt like it has about
a 25% better standby time,</text><text start="448.962" dur="2.418">so if you have light use,</text><text start="451.38" dur="2.46">you&amp;#39;re just casually like
getting text messages,</text><text start="453.84" dur="1.126">doing one or two workouts,</text><text start="454.966" dur="3.254">you can easily get two
full days outta this watch.</text><text start="458.22" dur="1.11">And then if you&amp;#39;re going heavy,</text><text start="459.33" dur="3.24">if it&amp;#39;s a bunch of workouts,
then it&amp;#39;s closer to even,</text><text start="462.57" dur="1.86">but it&amp;#39;s still a solid day and a half,</text><text start="464.43" dur="0.84">especially when you&amp;#39;re using</text><text start="465.27" dur="2.94">that 3,000 nit Super AMOLED Display a lot.</text><text start="468.21" dur="0.833">That&amp;#39;s impressive.</text><text start="469.043" dur="2.739">So, yeah, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear
that Samsung has copied</text><text start="471.782" dur="3.898">a lot of features and things
about the Apple Watch Ultra,</text><text start="475.68" dur="2.28">but as I&amp;#39;ve kept saying,</text><text start="477.96" dur="1.726">if you copy the good stuff,</text><text start="479.686" dur="2.954">then you can still end
up with a great product,</text><text start="482.64" dur="1.47">no matter how shameless it is.</text><text start="484.11" dur="2.16">But the conclusion about
this one is kind of funny,</text><text start="486.27" dur="5">because Samsung also updated
the Watch7 at the same time,</text><text start="492.33" dur="3.78">and that watch also
has dual-frequency GPS,</text><text start="496.11" dur="1.295">the screen is the same size,</text><text start="497.405" dur="1.885">even though it&amp;#39;s a smaller battery,</text><text start="499.29" dur="2.22">it&amp;#39;s still got sapphire crystal on top,</text><text start="501.51" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s got three sporty bands
and it&amp;#39;s like half the price.</text><text start="505.8" dur="2.43">So, that ends up making this one</text><text start="508.23" dur="2.311">feel harder to recommend
if it&amp;#39;s so similar.</text><text start="510.541" dur="2.669">So, this just ends up being a Galaxy Watch</text><text start="513.21" dur="3.99">for people who want that,
but with a bigger battery,</text><text start="517.2" dur="3.586">and I guess just a little
more ruggedized features,</text><text start="520.786" dur="1.364">and that&amp;#39;s kind of it,</text><text start="522.15" dur="3.57">and you have $650 you&amp;#39;re
willing to spend on it.</text><text start="525.72" dur="2.325">So, I think the rotating
bezel would&amp;#39;ve been</text><text start="528.045" dur="2.603">easier to justify and like separate them,</text><text start="530.648" dur="4.432">but yeah, for now, this is
one of those Samsung products</text><text start="535.08" dur="3.704">that&amp;#39;s a little more
shameless in its inspiration,</text><text start="538.784" dur="1.696">and it won&amp;#39;t be the last one,</text><text start="540.48" dur="0.873">from either side.</text><text start="542.73" dur="0.958">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="543.688" dur="1.639">Catch you guys to the next one.</text><text start="545.327" dur="0.833">Peace.</text><text start="546.16" dur="3.167">(bright subtle music)</text></transcript>
