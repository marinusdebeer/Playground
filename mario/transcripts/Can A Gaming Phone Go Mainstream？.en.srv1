(camera whirring)</text><text start="12.329" dur="1.047">(electronic buzzing)</text><text start="13.376" dur="0.833">(switch clicks)</text><text start="14.209" dur="2.651">- So, one of the best
gaming phones on the planet</text><text start="16.86" dur="2.13">is going mainstream.</text><text start="18.99" dur="2.217">Like, look at all the previous ROG Phones:</text><text start="21.207" dur="3.693">ROG Phone 1, ROG Phone 2, ROG Phone 3...</text><text start="24.9" dur="1.59">Skipped 4 because 4 is bad luck.</text><text start="26.49" dur="3.45">ROG Phone 5 ROG, Phone 6, and ROG Phone 7.</text><text start="29.94" dur="3.21">Now, this one is the ROG Phone 8 Pro.</text><text start="33.15" dur="3.18">This one is noticeably more regular.</text><text start="36.33" dur="2.58">So ASUS still makes other regular phones,</text><text start="38.91" dur="3.9">the Zenfone, and ROG still
stands for Republic of Gamers.</text><text start="42.81" dur="2.31">This is very much still a gaming phone.</text><text start="45.12" dur="3.15">But the thing that makes
gaming phones so good at gaming</text><text start="48.27" dur="2.76">also makes them really good at media</text><text start="51.03" dur="3.24">and just being all-around
really good daily drivers.</text><text start="54.27" dur="1.927">So ASUS has finally said, &amp;quot;You know what?</text><text start="56.197" dur="3.09">&amp;quot;What if we just package
our great gaming phone</text><text start="59.287" dur="1.313">&amp;quot;for the masses?&amp;quot;</text><text start="60.6" dur="1.68">And I think this is the first one</text><text start="62.28" dur="2.64">where they&amp;#39;ve really
committed to that idea.</text><text start="64.92" dur="3">Now, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, they
still pack in the gamer stuff.</text><text start="67.92" dur="2.13">There&amp;#39;s still a hidden display
on the back of the phone</text><text start="70.05" dur="3.66">and all kinds of crazy specs,
but the pivot is real here.</text><text start="73.71" dur="2.88">So, given the fact that
it&amp;#39;s still a gaming phone,</text><text start="76.59" dur="2.67">we are not surprised that
it still turns up the specs</text><text start="79.26" dur="1.68">all the way to the bleeding edge</text><text start="80.94" dur="4.5">with this 6.78-inch 165
Hz AMOLED display up front</text><text start="85.44" dur="3.33">that gets to a crazy bright 2,500 nits.</text><text start="88.77" dur="2.88">It&amp;#39;s got a 3.3 gigahertz
Snapdragon 8 gen 3</text><text start="91.65" dur="4.65">with up to 24 gigs of LPDDR5X RAM</text><text start="96.3" dur="3.36">and a terabyte of UFS 4.0 fast storage.</text><text start="99.66" dur="1.46">It smokes Geekbench.</text><text start="101.12" dur="1.93">It just crushes 3DMark.</text><text start="103.05" dur="2.58">It can play &amp;quot;Genshin Impact&amp;quot; at 60 FPS.</text><text start="105.63" dur="2.13">Like, this phone is ridiculously fast.</text><text start="107.76" dur="2.16">Also, opening and moving through apps</text><text start="109.92" dur="2.67">and just using it like
a normal phone is crazy.</text><text start="112.59" dur="2.73">It&amp;#39;s one of the snappiest
phones I&amp;#39;ve ever used.</text><text start="115.32" dur="2.13">Taking photos is extremely quick</text><text start="117.45" dur="2.49">from the millisecond your finger
touches the shutter button.</text><text start="119.94" dur="3.21">Even this optical fingerprint
reader underneath the glass</text><text start="123.15" dur="1.29">is surprisingly fast.</text><text start="124.44" dur="1.86">It&amp;#39;s just overall the fastest,</text><text start="126.3" dur="2.52">like, the most reactive
phone I&amp;#39;ve ever used.</text><text start="128.82" dur="2.7">So all that is great, and
we know it can handle games,</text><text start="131.52" dur="1.59">but if you&amp;#39;re ASUS,</text><text start="133.11" dur="4.71">how do you now package this
as a great daily driver?</text><text start="137.82" dur="2.16">&amp;#39;Cause let&amp;#39;s be honest,
the previous gaming phones</text><text start="139.98" dur="2.55">were just so gamery.</text><text start="142.53" dur="1.17">So okay, first things first:</text><text start="143.7" dur="1.83">It&amp;#39;s gotta be more one-handable.</text><text start="145.53" dur="2.1">Like, yes, you still want
a huge display for gaming,</text><text start="147.63" dur="2.28">and gamers will spend a lot of
time with the phone sideways</text><text start="149.91" dur="2.52">and in two hands, but
regular phone stuff happens</text><text start="152.43" dur="1.77">vertically with one hand all the time.</text><text start="154.2" dur="2.07">So they&amp;#39;ve shrunken the bezels</text><text start="156.27" dur="1.68">all the way around all the sides,</text><text start="157.95" dur="2.28">and it&amp;#39;s pretty noticeable
at the top and the bottom,</text><text start="160.23" dur="1.44">which is now looking on par</text><text start="161.67" dur="1.92">with other full-screen
flagships out there.</text><text start="163.59" dur="3.81">And that does also mean it&amp;#39;s
the first time in an ROG Phone</text><text start="167.4" dur="2.1">that they&amp;#39;ve ever had a hole punch camera.</text><text start="169.5" dur="1.38">But it&amp;#39;s also a pretty small hole punch,</text><text start="170.88" dur="1.5">so it looks totally normal.</text><text start="172.38" dur="2.22">And this also comes at the
expense of a little bit</text><text start="174.6" dur="2.01">of that front-facing speaker space.</text><text start="176.61" dur="2.04">The speakers are still quite loud</text><text start="178.65" dur="2.61">and full-sounding stereo
front-facing speakers,</text><text start="181.26" dur="3.42">but yeah, the fact is
they&amp;#39;re slightly less insane</text><text start="184.68" dur="1.38">than last year.</text><text start="186.06" dur="2.01">And then, they also went
and made the phone thinner.</text><text start="188.07" dur="2.22">So they flattened out
the frame on the sides,</text><text start="190.29" dur="1.53">again, similar to some other phones,</text><text start="191.82" dur="2.16">so the whole thing is slightly more trim,</text><text start="193.98" dur="2.97">cutting it under nine
millimeters for the first time.</text><text start="196.95" dur="2.25">And it&amp;#39;s still, honestly,
pretty well-balanced,</text><text start="199.2" dur="1.23">even with this camera bump</text><text start="200.43" dur="1.32">that we&amp;#39;ll talk about in a minute.</text><text start="201.75" dur="3.15">But, of course, thinner
also means, you guessed it,</text><text start="204.9" dur="2.37">slightly smaller battery,</text><text start="207.27" dur="2.07">again, for the first time in an ROG Phone.</text><text start="209.34" dur="4.71">It goes from 6,000 milliamp
hours to 5,500 milliamp hours.</text><text start="214.05" dur="1.62">To be honest, in using this phone,</text><text start="215.67" dur="1.56">I haven&amp;#39;t really noticed the difference</text><text start="217.23" dur="1.56">because it&amp;#39;s still such a battery champ</text><text start="218.79" dur="1.59">with all the optimizations</text><text start="220.38" dur="3.81">ASUS has pulled with the
software, with this display,</text><text start="224.19" dur="1.92">but they did technically
make the battery smaller.</text><text start="226.11" dur="1.89">So the result of all that
trimming and sculpting</text><text start="228" dur="2.61">is a phone that it&amp;#39;s definitely still big,</text><text start="230.61" dur="3.24">but it&amp;#39;s much closer to
a normal-sized phone.</text><text start="233.85" dur="2.4">It&amp;#39;s basically the same
size as my Pixel 8 Pro</text><text start="236.25" dur="2.25">that I&amp;#39;ve been dailying,
but it still has room</text><text start="238.5" dur="2.61">for the gamery, media-friendly features.</text><text start="241.11" dur="2.94">Like, there&amp;#39;s still a second
USB-C port on the side,</text><text start="244.05" dur="2.85">so you can keep charging
while gaming in landscape.</text><text start="246.9" dur="2.49">Still got the remappable shoulder triggers</text><text start="249.39" dur="1.44">and the rare headphone jack.</text><text start="250.83" dur="1.05">And side note, I&amp;#39;ve been testing</text><text start="251.88" dur="1.56">a couple in-ear monitors lately</text><text start="253.44" dur="2.07">and just enjoying using
them in all kinds of places,</text><text start="255.51" dur="1.05">and this is one of the rare phones</text><text start="256.56" dur="2.34">that I can actually plug
it in and use it with.</text><text start="258.9" dur="1.98">And ASUS throws in a surprising amount</text><text start="260.88" dur="1.41">of audio adjustment features</text><text start="262.29" dur="2.61">and a bunch of different
profiles and EQ settings</text><text start="264.9" dur="1.89">that you can play with
and make a big difference.</text><text start="266.79" dur="1.71">And then, hey, if you&amp;#39;re
gonna use this daily,</text><text start="268.5" dur="2.94">people are gonna want the
confidence of water resistance.</text><text start="271.44" dur="2.07">Like, real water resistance.</text><text start="273.51" dur="2.967">Previous gaming phones don&amp;#39;t
really focus on that too much.</text><text start="276.477" dur="3.603">ROG Phone 7 was IP54, and that&amp;#39;s nice,</text><text start="280.08" dur="3.39">but this is the first ROG Phone
that stepped up to full IP68</text><text start="283.47" dur="1.2">water and dust resistance,</text><text start="284.67" dur="1.53">which is sort of the gold standard</text><text start="286.2" dur="1.29">of not just getting rained on</text><text start="287.49" dur="2.61">but, like, you can spill
a drink on your phone</text><text start="290.1" dur="3.51">or drop it in the toilet and
actually be totally fine.</text><text start="293.61" dur="3.453">Now, do we still think this
looks like a gaming phone?</text><text start="297.93" dur="2.64">Honestly, I think they&amp;#39;ve done a good job.</text><text start="300.57" dur="0.93">It&amp;#39;s a nice balance.</text><text start="301.5" dur="1.92">Like, they&amp;#39;ve done a slow ramp</text><text start="303.42" dur="2.19">of toning it down a
little bit over the years</text><text start="305.61" dur="3.96">and less RGB and jagged
lines and screens on the back</text><text start="309.57" dur="0.93">and all that sort of stuff.</text><text start="310.5" dur="1.14">Now, with this one,</text><text start="311.64" dur="1.8">I think the camera bump
is the weirdest part,</text><text start="313.44" dur="2.04">but aside from that, it&amp;#39;s pretty subtle.</text><text start="315.48" dur="1.47">Like, this one, it&amp;#39;s a satin black,</text><text start="316.95" dur="1.71">so it doesn&amp;#39;t show any fingerprints.</text><text start="318.66" dur="2.55">It&amp;#39;s got a single diagonal glossy strip,</text><text start="321.21" dur="4.02">which definitely screams
or maybe whispers, &amp;quot;Gamer,&amp;quot;</text><text start="325.23" dur="1.74">but I don&amp;#39;t mind it.</text><text start="326.97" dur="1.95">And then I could probably
do without all the text:</text><text start="328.92" dur="1.65">The &amp;quot;Republic of Gamers&amp;quot; text</text><text start="330.57" dur="2.82">or the &amp;quot;Good luck, have fun&amp;quot;
text next to the USB-C port.</text><text start="333.39" dur="1.65">But honestly, this is fine.</text><text start="335.04" dur="1.35">It&amp;#39;s super toned down.</text><text start="336.39" dur="3.75">But what if I told you
there is still a display</text><text start="340.14" dur="1.413">on the back of this phone?</text><text start="342.51" dur="1.47">&amp;#39;Cause there is. They
couldn&amp;#39;t help themselves.</text><text start="343.98" dur="1.62">Like, you literally cannot tell</text><text start="345.6" dur="1.8">when the screen is off where it is.</text><text start="347.4" dur="1.41">But if you go into the Armoury Crate</text><text start="348.81" dur="2.46">and turn on AniMe Vision...</text><text start="351.27" dur="2.07">I don&amp;#39;t why it&amp;#39;s called that.</text><text start="353.34" dur="2.1">But the display then lights
up, it comes to life.</text><text start="355.44" dur="2.91">It&amp;#39;s this all-white LED dot matrix display</text><text start="358.35" dur="1.86">that can show all kinds of things,</text><text start="360.21" dur="5">from logos to charging status
to incoming call notifications</text><text start="365.46" dur="2.01">and notification counters, et cetera.</text><text start="367.47" dur="2.25">Even when you&amp;#39;re taking a picture,</text><text start="369.72" dur="1.29">if there&amp;#39;s a countdown timer,</text><text start="371.01" dur="2.97">it&amp;#39;ll do the countdown
on the outside screen.</text><text start="373.98" dur="1.17">Or even when you&amp;#39;re gaming,</text><text start="375.15" dur="3.12">it&amp;#39;ll just tell the world
that you&amp;#39;re playing a game.</text><text start="378.27" dur="3.54">It is definitely certifiably gimmicky,</text><text start="381.81" dur="2.04">but I like it anyway for a couple reasons:</text><text start="383.85" dur="2.61">One, it&amp;#39;s still pretty minimal</text><text start="386.46" dur="0.833">on the back of the phone here.</text><text start="387.293" dur="1.807">But two, it&amp;#39;s actually functional.</text><text start="389.1" dur="2.13">It&amp;#39;s giving you real useful information</text><text start="391.23" dur="0.833">on the back of the phone.</text><text start="392.063" dur="1.357">I would say even more
than the Nothing Phone.</text><text start="393.42" dur="1.65">It&amp;#39;s customizable, you can go through</text><text start="395.07" dur="2.46">and make special ones just
for whatever use case.</text><text start="397.53" dur="2.88">And then when the screen is
off, you just can&amp;#39;t even see it,</text><text start="400.41" dur="1.41">can&amp;#39;t even tell it&amp;#39;s there.</text><text start="401.82" dur="2.85">And on top of all of
that, they even made room</text><text start="404.67" dur="3.66">for the first-ever wireless
charging in an ROG Phone.</text><text start="408.33" dur="2.67">So these gaming phones have
always had so much chaos</text><text start="411" dur="1.65">going around on the back of the phone,</text><text start="412.65" dur="1.23">with these screens and lights,</text><text start="413.88" dur="2.25">that they never had room
for wireless charging,</text><text start="416.13" dur="1.2">and that was totally fine</text><text start="417.33" dur="1.74">because gamers just weren&amp;#39;t interested.</text><text start="419.07" dur="3.57">But this time, they&amp;#39;ve
actually made the space for it.</text><text start="422.64" dur="1.02">One thing I&amp;#39;ll say though,</text><text start="423.66" dur="3.6">the coil is a little
higher up here than normal.</text><text start="427.26" dur="1.8">It&amp;#39;s above that little display.</text><text start="429.06" dur="2.91">And so I think it&amp;#39;s a little
higher than most other phones</text><text start="431.97" dur="0.833">&amp;#39;cause if I put the phone</text><text start="432.803" dur="1.837">on a vertical wireless charger like this,</text><text start="434.64" dur="2.52">it actually doesn&amp;#39;t line
up, and it doesn&amp;#39;t charge.</text><text start="437.16" dur="3.78">But I discovered that if I turn
it sideways, it does charge.</text><text start="440.94" dur="1.56">So you may have to play
with that a little bit.</text><text start="442.5" dur="1.56">And, you know, lots of people
don&amp;#39;t use wireless charging,</text><text start="444.06" dur="1.98">and that&amp;#39;s fine, but just
feels like this is something</text><text start="446.04" dur="2.37">you have to offer to be considered</text><text start="448.41" dur="3.3">one of the high-end versatile flagships.</text><text start="451.71" dur="0.96">Even if you never use that,</text><text start="452.67" dur="2.73">there&amp;#39;s still 65-watt wired charging</text><text start="455.4" dur="3.48">with the brick that is,
yes, included in the box.</text><text start="458.88" dur="3.757">Now, in previous reviews,
I would literally say,</text><text start="462.637" dur="4.11">&amp;quot;The camera, it&amp;#39;s pretty
bad, but it&amp;#39;s a gaming phone.</text><text start="466.747" dur="1.14">&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not one of the reasons</text><text start="467.887" dur="1.643">&amp;quot;that you&amp;#39;re buying this phone,&amp;quot;</text><text start="469.53" dur="1.5">and then, so it would just be fine.</text><text start="471.03" dur="2.22">But in a phone that you want to package</text><text start="473.25" dur="2.94">and sell as a mainstream phone,</text><text start="476.19" dur="1.38">that goes from an afterthought</text><text start="477.57" dur="3.03">to literally one of the most
important pieces of this phone.</text><text start="480.6" dur="1.68">So how did they do?</text><text start="482.28" dur="2.64">Well, this is an all-new camera
system for the ROG Phone.</text><text start="484.92" dur="2.31">It&amp;#39;s a 50-megapixel primary camera,</text><text start="487.23" dur="2.01">a 3x telephoto for the first time,</text><text start="489.24" dur="1.89">and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide.</text><text start="491.13" dur="2.04">It&amp;#39;s more hardware than before,</text><text start="493.17" dur="2.82">but I would say it somehow still feels</text><text start="495.99" dur="3.6">behind the Zenfone 10,
which is also made by ASUS.</text><text start="499.59" dur="1.98">Like, are those branches of the company</text><text start="501.57" dur="1.53">even talking to each other? (laughs)</text><text start="503.1" dur="3.18">This primary camera sensor is an IMX890.</text><text start="506.28" dur="3.03">It&amp;#39;s the same camera sensor
that&amp;#39;s in the OnePlus 11,</text><text start="509.31" dur="1.59">and the Nothing Phone 2,</text><text start="510.9" dur="3.15">and some other phones
in the $600-$700 range.</text><text start="514.05" dur="1.08">And it produces pictures</text><text start="515.13" dur="2.22">that look kind of like those phones, too.</text><text start="517.35" dur="1.89">They&amp;#39;re decent sometimes in good light,</text><text start="519.24" dur="2.28">but often a little too much motion blur</text><text start="521.52" dur="2.67">and a lot too much HDR.</text><text start="524.19" dur="2.52">Seriously, sometimes, with
people as the subjects,</text><text start="526.71" dur="1.26">it looks like they&amp;#39;re just trying</text><text start="527.97" dur="2.13">to blast the exposure on faces</text><text start="530.1" dur="1.26">and drag everything else down.</text><text start="531.36" dur="2.1">It&amp;#39;s just very aggressive processing.</text><text start="533.46" dur="1.89">Like it&amp;#39;s running
algorithms made for a sensor</text><text start="535.35" dur="1.68">from five years ago.</text><text start="537.03" dur="1.32">Now, there are upsides,</text><text start="538.35" dur="2.1">like the super steady
video it&amp;#39;s now capable of</text><text start="540.45" dur="3.75">thanks to the hybrid six-axis
gimbal, just like the Zenfone.</text><text start="544.2" dur="2.55">It means you can shoot
slightly better handheld</text><text start="546.75" dur="2.73">in low light, but it&amp;#39;s
really smooth video.</text><text start="549.48" dur="2.22">And the front-facing
camera is wider angle,</text><text start="551.7" dur="1.32">so you can fit more people in the frame,</text><text start="553.02" dur="2.19">even if it is still kind of HDR-ry.</text><text start="555.21" dur="2.01">And the telephoto, that&amp;#39;s something new</text><text start="557.22" dur="2.22">that the Zenfone also doesn&amp;#39;t have,</text><text start="559.44" dur="1.44">and that is genuinely useful.</text><text start="560.88" dur="1.29">If you shoot a lot of zoom,</text><text start="562.17" dur="2.01">you know, 3x isn&amp;#39;t the
most zoom in the world,</text><text start="564.18" dur="3.18">but the stabilization
on it is so rock solid,</text><text start="567.36" dur="1.68">so you can keep punching
it with digital zoom.</text><text start="569.04" dur="2.04">All that&amp;#39;s to say it&amp;#39;s leveled up,</text><text start="571.08" dur="4.891">but it&amp;#39;s clearly still not
the focus of this phone.</text><text start="575.971" dur="0.992">(chuckles) &amp;quot;Focus.&amp;quot;</text><text start="576.963" dur="2.187">But it&amp;#39;s not the strength of this phone,</text><text start="579.15" dur="5">which might just be fine
in another $600-$700 phone.</text><text start="584.31" dur="2.16">But as you may have picked up from my tone</text><text start="586.47" dur="1.89">and from the rest of
the specs in this video,</text><text start="588.36" dur="1.433">this is not a $600-$700 phone.</text><text start="589.793" dur="5">This is a very flagship phone
with a very flagship price.</text><text start="594.99" dur="5">This ROG Phone starts at $1,100.</text><text start="600.21" dur="3.66">And the spec that I&amp;#39;m reviewing,
with the 24 gigs of RAM</text><text start="603.87" dur="1.26">and the terabyte of storage,</text><text start="605.13" dur="5">this ROG Phone Pro is $1,500.</text><text start="610.2" dur="2.16">Now, I also wanna point out</text><text start="612.36" dur="4.32">that you&amp;#39;re gonna start
noticing AI features</text><text start="616.68" dur="3.27">with basically every phone
that comes out this year</text><text start="619.95" dur="1.44">with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</text><text start="621.39" dur="1.32">Like, this is one of the first ones.</text><text start="622.71" dur="0.96">There&amp;#39;s maybe one or two other</text><text start="623.67" dur="1.41">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 phones out.</text><text start="625.08" dur="3.39">But Qualcomm has built
in new AI capabilities</text><text start="628.47" dur="3.81">into that chip, and oh,
boy, every manufacturer&amp;#39;s</text><text start="632.28" dur="2.94">got some new AI stuff to
play with in their phone.</text><text start="635.22" dur="1.32">So, for this gaming phone,</text><text start="636.54" dur="1.38">they&amp;#39;ve built in some clever things</text><text start="637.92" dur="2.79">like pattern recognition inside of games</text><text start="640.71" dur="1.92">to fast forward through recognize scenes</text><text start="642.63" dur="1.47">in certain supported games</text><text start="644.1" dur="1.89">or even recognize what&amp;#39;s on the screen</text><text start="645.99" dur="2.13">and prompt you to find a walkthrough</text><text start="648.12" dur="2.16">of the part of the game that you&amp;#39;re in.</text><text start="650.28" dur="1.71">Now, I found, you know, the smaller stuff</text><text start="651.99" dur="1.98">like the setting search more useful.</text><text start="653.97" dur="1.56">It&amp;#39;s got more semantic understanding.</text><text start="655.53" dur="2.19">It can intelligently find the
setting you&amp;#39;re looking for</text><text start="657.72" dur="0.99">based on what you write.</text><text start="658.71" dur="3">So even if you type like &amp;quot;Two of one,&amp;quot;</text><text start="661.71" dur="1.477">it knows, &amp;quot;Oh, you&amp;#39;re,
you&amp;#39;re talking about</text><text start="663.187" dur="1.23">&amp;quot;the Twin Apps feature</text><text start="664.417" dur="1.89">&amp;quot;that lets you have multiple accounts open</text><text start="666.307" dur="1.733">&amp;quot;for one app at the same time.&amp;quot;</text><text start="668.04" dur="3.12">But in general, that&amp;#39;s just
gonna be a theme of 2024</text><text start="671.16" dur="1.23">to look out for:</text><text start="672.39" dur="3.783">AI capabilities of phones with this chip.</text><text start="677.91" dur="1.8">You can just trust me on this one.</text><text start="679.71" dur="4.08">So the summary of the ROG
Phone (chuckles) is...</text><text start="683.79" dur="3.09">Look, this is still a
very capable, powerful,</text><text start="686.88" dur="3.87">really fast Android
phone, like it always is,</text><text start="690.75" dur="2.13">and it&amp;#39;s just a little more tame looking.</text><text start="692.88" dur="3.27">Like, they&amp;#39;ve traded
some of their gamery edge</text><text start="696.15" dur="1.29">for mass appeal.</text><text start="697.44" dur="2.07">And I think a lot of the
decisions were really smart.</text><text start="699.51" dur="4.47">Like trading some of the basic
stuff like thinner bezels</text><text start="703.98" dur="3.39">and a little bit more of a
trim, like, overall form factor</text><text start="707.37" dur="1.71">and one or two millimeters of thickness</text><text start="709.08" dur="2.7">for a slightly smaller battery, fine.</text><text start="711.78" dur="1.17">And I still think, you know,</text><text start="712.95" dur="2.82">getting the gamer stuff
with the display on the back</text><text start="715.77" dur="1.95">but still having wireless charging</text><text start="717.72" dur="2.28">and IP68 water resistance, that&amp;#39;s great.</text><text start="720" dur="2.43">But the one thing that they couldn&amp;#39;t quite</text><text start="722.43" dur="3.72">get over that hump is the camera system.</text><text start="726.15" dur="2.22">It&amp;#39;s good, but it&amp;#39;s not over that hump,</text><text start="728.37" dur="2.875">and that just happens to be one
of the most important things</text><text start="731.245" dur="2.885">about a mainstream phone.</text><text start="734.13" dur="5">And so this remains a
really good gamer phone.</text><text start="740.46" dur="1.35">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="741.81" dur="1.56">Catch you guys in the next one.</text><text start="743.37" dur="0.833">Peace.</text><text start="744.203" dur="4.279">♪ Your words and things you bought ♪</text></transcript>
