♪ Ooh ♪</text><text start="3.041" dur="1.129">- All right, welcome to</text><text start="4.17" dur="3.66">the definitive iPhone
versus Android video.</text><text start="7.83" dur="1.59">It&amp;#39;s the impossible debate, right?</text><text start="9.42" dur="1.8">In a lot of ways, people just get</text><text start="11.22" dur="1.53">so entrenched on one side</text><text start="12.75" dur="2.01">that they never wanna
flip to the other side.</text><text start="14.76" dur="0.87">To each their own.</text><text start="15.63" dur="3.628">You hear that all the time,
but I have a solution.</text><text start="19.258" dur="1.202">So here&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;re gonna do this.</text><text start="20.46" dur="1.26">So I&amp;#39;m gonna break this down into</text><text start="21.72" dur="2.49">seven actually meaningful categories,</text><text start="24.21" dur="2.31">so it&amp;#39;s an odd number, so there
has to be a winner, no tie,</text><text start="26.52" dur="1.8">but since we&amp;#39;re not
psychos and we know that</text><text start="28.32" dur="1.89">one winner doesn&amp;#39;t automatically apply</text><text start="30.21" dur="1.41">to every human on earth,</text><text start="31.62" dur="1.59">I&amp;#39;m actually gonna give you a system,</text><text start="33.21" dur="3.367">a rubric to help figure out
the real winner for yourself.</text><text start="36.577" dur="2.723">You&amp;#39;ll see what I mean. Let&amp;#39;s get into it.</text><text start="39.3" dur="0.833">So, all right.</text><text start="40.133" dur="2.905">Category number one. Customization.</text><text start="43.038" dur="3.072">Basically, if you see this
icon and you get excited,</text><text start="46.11" dur="1.98">then you probably love customization too.</text><text start="48.09" dur="1.38">So, digging into the settings</text><text start="49.47" dur="2.43">and messing around with the
home screen and the lock screen</text><text start="51.9" dur="2.22">and tweaking things and behaviors</text><text start="54.12" dur="3.24">to make the device
absolutely perfect for you,</text><text start="57.36" dur="2.13">I mean, it&amp;#39;s a hobby all on its own.</text><text start="59.49" dur="3.81">Now, at first in 2023, it
might actually seem like</text><text start="63.3" dur="4.705">iOS 17 and Android 14
are pretty close, right?</text><text start="68.005" dur="1.145">I mean, let&amp;#39;s be real.</text><text start="69.15" dur="2.46">iOS just added a bunch
of really good features</text><text start="71.61" dur="1.05">that are very well done.</text><text start="72.66" dur="2.01">The new lock screen update
gives you the ability</text><text start="74.67" dur="2.91">to change all these clock fonts and colors</text><text start="77.58" dur="2.91">and put various super useful
widgets on your lock screen</text><text start="80.49" dur="2.73">and then save a bunch of
different lock screen setups</text><text start="83.22" dur="2.85">for different situations
and different focus modes,</text><text start="86.07" dur="2.4">and then widgets were also
added to the home screen</text><text start="88.47" dur="1.23">less than two years ago as well,</text><text start="89.7" dur="2.13">so that unlocked a ton of customization</text><text start="91.83" dur="2.97">of home screen setups displaying
glanceable information,</text><text start="94.8" dur="1.5">but the more you look into it,</text><text start="96.3" dur="3.09">the more you realize it&amp;#39;s
not actually that close,</text><text start="99.39" dur="1.47">and a lot of this really just
comes down to the fact that</text><text start="100.86" dur="2.31">Apple, they do keep adding
all these abilities,</text><text start="103.17" dur="1.56">but you&amp;#39;re always restricted to</text><text start="104.73" dur="3.207">doing it the Apple way, the correct way,</text><text start="107.937" dur="2.476">and so that&amp;#39;s why a lot of iPhone setups</text><text start="110.413" dur="1.937">still just kind of look the same.</text><text start="112.35" dur="2.43">Like, even if you just
take stock Android 14</text><text start="114.78" dur="1.08">from the Google Pixel,</text><text start="115.86" dur="2.591">which isn&amp;#39;t even the most
customizable version of Android,</text><text start="118.451" dur="3.002">there&amp;#39;s still way more
that you can change,</text><text start="121.453" dur="2.867">from the colors of the theme of the OS</text><text start="124.32" dur="2.91">matching the color of your
wallpaper thanks to Material You</text><text start="127.23" dur="3.196">to icon packs, custom widget sizes.</text><text start="130.426" dur="1.394">I mean, Android will just kind of</text><text start="131.82" dur="2.19">let you do whatever you want.</text><text start="134.01" dur="0.833">On the iPhone,</text><text start="134.843" dur="2.617">you can&amp;#39;t expand a widget
to any size you want.</text><text start="137.46" dur="1.2">You can&amp;#39;t put an app</text><text start="138.66" dur="2.73">just on the right side of your
home screen for reachability.</text><text start="141.39" dur="1.62">You literally can&amp;#39;t even place an app</text><text start="143.01" dur="1.47">wherever you want on the home screen.</text><text start="144.48" dur="3.48">It must be the next up in
the grid of Apple&amp;#39;s choosing.</text><text start="147.96" dur="1.71">You can&amp;#39;t change the grid&amp;#39;s size.</text><text start="149.67" dur="1.901">You can&amp;#39;t change the icon sizes.</text><text start="151.571" dur="2.179">I mean, it just takes a
whole bunch of extra work</text><text start="153.75" dur="2.7">and a Siri Shortcuts hack
just to use a custom icon.</text><text start="156.45" dur="1.02">Just basic stuff.</text><text start="157.47" dur="1.29">Now, I think the other
side of that coin is</text><text start="158.76" dur="4.47">you can make a truly ugly,
horrible Android setup,</text><text start="163.23" dur="2.37">where you can&amp;#39;t really mess up</text><text start="165.6" dur="1.68">an iPhone home screen that much.</text><text start="167.28" dur="1.26">So, while you can definitely argue that</text><text start="168.54" dur="1.8">iOS does it prettier,</text><text start="170.34" dur="4.29">the winner for most customization,
that would be Android.</text><text start="174.63" dur="3">So, then category number
two, features, all right?</text><text start="177.63" dur="3.33">Just straight up which
one can do more stuff.</text><text start="180.96" dur="1.2">This has been one of the hottest debates</text><text start="182.16" dur="2.327">at the forefront of iOS versus Android</text><text start="184.487" dur="1.873">conversations you always hear,</text><text start="186.36" dur="3.15">mostly because both
platforms, at some level,</text><text start="189.51" dur="3.27">launched missing features,
but especially the iPhone.</text><text start="192.78" dur="0.833">Like, you&amp;#39;d always hear,</text><text start="193.613" dur="3.547">&amp;quot;Wow, can you believe the iPhone
can&amp;#39;t even set wallpapers?&amp;quot;</text><text start="197.16" dur="1.86">And then it was, &amp;quot;Can
you believe the iPhone</text><text start="199.02" dur="2.82">is just now getting copy
and paste, seriously?&amp;quot;</text><text start="201.84" dur="2.022">And then it&amp;#39;s, &amp;quot;Wow, it&amp;#39;s crazy that iOS</text><text start="203.862" dur="2.328">is just getting widgets
now a decade later.&amp;quot;</text><text start="206.19" dur="3.03">But, hey, now, it&amp;#39;s 2023 and
they&amp;#39;re both very complete,</text><text start="209.22" dur="1.29">and even in the ways that they&amp;#39;re not,</text><text start="210.51" dur="1.95">they&amp;#39;re copying each other all the time.</text><text start="212.46" dur="2.49">You always see a new keynote
with new stuff on Android,</text><text start="214.95" dur="1.41">and you&amp;#39;re like, that came from iOS,</text><text start="216.36" dur="1.8">and then you&amp;#39;ll see stuff
from the iPhone keynote</text><text start="218.16" dur="1.77">and be like, that came from Android,</text><text start="219.93" dur="1.17">but there&amp;#39;s even some new stuff now</text><text start="221.1" dur="2.34">that the iPhone has that Android doesn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="223.44" dur="2.16">A pretty good one recently is focus modes,</text><text start="225.6" dur="2.79">which gives you super high
control over notifications</text><text start="228.39" dur="1.68">in various different situations</text><text start="230.07" dur="1.74">with your apps and your contacts.</text><text start="231.81" dur="2.46">There are also a lot of privacy features,</text><text start="234.27" dur="2.64">things like Hide My Email with iCloud Plus</text><text start="236.91" dur="1.543">and iCloud Private Relay.</text><text start="238.453" dur="3.737">You could even argue that
Dynamic Island on the Pro iPhone</text><text start="242.19" dur="1.68">is a feature if you want to,</text><text start="243.87" dur="1.32">but, I mean, I just couldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="245.19" dur="2.19">because only a small
handful of apps support it,</text><text start="247.38" dur="1.53">but it&amp;#39;s something pretty cool and unique,</text><text start="248.91" dur="2.04">which is more and more rare than ever</text><text start="250.95" dur="1.02">in the smartphone world.</text><text start="251.97" dur="1.11">At this point, though,</text><text start="253.08" dur="3.713">neither OS is really missing
any gigantic features anymore.</text><text start="256.793" dur="2.407">They&amp;#39;ve both matured up to this level</text><text start="259.2" dur="1.23">where they&amp;#39;re their own character.</text><text start="260.43" dur="2.264">They both do a lot of stuff,</text><text start="262.694" dur="3.736">but I still am gonna have to give the edge</text><text start="266.43" dur="1.659">to Android in this one</text><text start="268.089" dur="2.091">just because there are
so many little, like,</text><text start="270.18" dur="2.31">tweaky, like little OS-level features,</text><text start="272.49" dur="2.97">just little things that you
can tweak and change on Android</text><text start="275.46" dur="2.04">that still just are not on the iPhone.</text><text start="277.5" dur="2.52">So I&amp;#39;m talking like
battery management features</text><text start="280.02" dur="1.77">to customized charging speeds</text><text start="281.79" dur="3.51">or set manual charge limits
to preserve battery life.</text><text start="285.3" dur="2.67">There&amp;#39;s also an actual
file management system</text><text start="287.97" dur="1.47">so you can drag and drop things</text><text start="289.44" dur="2.7">onto your phone into certain
folders if you want to.</text><text start="292.14" dur="2.999">There&amp;#39;s gaming-specific
features like game modes,</text><text start="295.139" dur="2.041">the ability to dial up and down</text><text start="297.18" dur="2.7">your screen&amp;#39;s refresh
rate whenever you want to.</text><text start="299.88" dur="1.53">Independent volume controls</text><text start="301.41" dur="2.46">for phone calls and ringtones and alarms.</text><text start="303.87" dur="2.04">Also, reverse wireless
charging comes up a lot</text><text start="305.91" dur="1.47">for charging wireless earbuds</text><text start="307.38" dur="1.65">without breaking out a separate cable.</text><text start="309.03" dur="3">Really, just, it comes down
to the benefit of Android</text><text start="312.03" dur="2.341">is having so much feature choice.</text><text start="314.371" dur="1.619">That&amp;#39;s kind of the point,</text><text start="315.99" dur="1.95">and this also bleeds into hardware too.</text><text start="317.94" dur="1.53">So, even if the feature you want</text><text start="319.47" dur="3.054">is a huge camera with no notch,</text><text start="322.524" dur="2.826">then you have to get an
Android phone, right?</text><text start="325.35" dur="5">So, if the feature is a super
fast charging or a 10x camera</text><text start="331.02" dur="1.979">or USB Type-C,</text><text start="332.999" dur="2.911">as of right now, it&amp;#39;s
gotta be an Android phone.</text><text start="335.91" dur="2.67">So, even though they both
offer all of the basic features</text><text start="338.58" dur="2.34">and they appear to copy
each other all the time</text><text start="340.92" dur="1.26">on little added stuff,</text><text start="342.18" dur="3.45">the winner here, again,
is definitely Android.</text><text start="345.63" dur="2.506">Now, number three is ease of use.</text><text start="348.136" dur="3.974">Now, ease of use is very
valuable to a lot of people,</text><text start="352.11" dur="3.276">like a lot of people, and the
thing about ease of use is</text><text start="355.386" dur="3.324">it often basically has
an inverse relationship</text><text start="358.71" dur="3.21">with customization and a ton of features,</text><text start="361.92" dur="1.62">&amp;#39;cause there&amp;#39;s this delicate balancing act</text><text start="363.54" dur="2.91">you have to do of having flexibility,</text><text start="366.45" dur="2.04">giving flexibility to the user,</text><text start="368.49" dur="1.17">but not overwhelming them</text><text start="369.66" dur="1.62">with a ton of buttons and settings,</text><text start="371.28" dur="1.98">and this is really where the iPhone excels</text><text start="373.26" dur="3.96">and has excelled for years
as a high priority for sure,</text><text start="377.22" dur="1.92">even in the most fundamental ways.</text><text start="379.14" dur="1.47">The home screen on the iPhone</text><text start="380.61" dur="2.37">has had up to four icons in the dock</text><text start="382.98" dur="2.489">on every iPhone since the beginning,</text><text start="385.469" dur="2.161">and the phone icon has always been green</text><text start="387.63" dur="4.02">and always been on the left
every single time for 17 years.</text><text start="391.65" dur="1.29">The iPhone&amp;#39;s camera app,</text><text start="392.94" dur="2.67">we&amp;#39;ve all seen that stay
fundamentally the same</text><text start="395.61" dur="2.22">with the viewfinder and the sliding modes.</text><text start="397.83" dur="1.38">It&amp;#39;s been like that for years,</text><text start="399.21" dur="1.68">and that kind of tucks
away a lot of the settings</text><text start="400.89" dur="1.47">into a separate settings app</text><text start="402.36" dur="1.53">and it can feel like
it&amp;#39;s missing features,</text><text start="403.89" dur="2.07">but, honestly, it&amp;#39;s still the easiest</text><text start="405.96" dur="2.88">and most straightforward
for most people to use.</text><text start="408.84" dur="2.61">It&amp;#39;s like they hate changing
things for no good reason.</text><text start="411.45" dur="2.97">The calculator has basically
been unchanged for years.</text><text start="414.42" dur="1.23">Now, there&amp;#39;s also downsides to that,</text><text start="415.65" dur="1.92">like Siri has basically been ignored</text><text start="417.57" dur="2.7">since it was introduced, but, still, like,</text><text start="420.27" dur="3.24">Apple moves the call end
button by like 200 pixels</text><text start="423.51" dur="2.58">to the middle of the screen
and people freak out about it.</text><text start="426.09" dur="0.833">Sometimes, it feels like</text><text start="426.923" dur="2.317">Android versions will
just move stuff around</text><text start="429.24" dur="3.3">just kind of to try it and for
the sake of changing things,</text><text start="432.54" dur="1.38">and sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="433.92" dur="0.833">They&amp;#39;ll move it back,</text><text start="434.753" dur="3.097">and that&amp;#39;s interesting
and exciting sometimes,</text><text start="437.85" dur="4.2">but that does hurt just user
continuity and ease of use.</text><text start="442.05" dur="2.37">Maybe not for you watching this video,</text><text start="444.42" dur="1.47">but just think for the average person,</text><text start="445.89" dur="1.65">like for your five closest friends.</text><text start="447.54" dur="2.73">Think about how they use their phone.</text><text start="450.27" dur="1.2">Yeah, then throw on top of that,</text><text start="451.47" dur="2.31">there&amp;#39;s basically never any bloatware</text><text start="453.78" dur="4.08">loaded onto the iPhone ever,
and then customer service is</text><text start="457.86" dur="2.16">basically always better for an iPhone</text><text start="460.02" dur="1.5">because Apple stores are everywhere</text><text start="461.52" dur="2.49">and Apple controls that entire experience,</text><text start="464.01" dur="0.99">for better or for worse,</text><text start="465" dur="1.83">so they get to do great
work with customers.</text><text start="466.83" dur="2.67">So it&amp;#39;s just for people
who are not enthusiasts</text><text start="469.5" dur="3.306">who just wanna get the thing
and not think about it anymore,</text><text start="472.806" dur="2.544">they pretty much always
go with the iPhone.</text><text start="475.35" dur="2.79">So ease of use is a
checkbox for the iPhone.</text><text start="478.14" dur="2.25">By the way, if you&amp;#39;re enjoying
this video, get subscribed.</text><text start="480.39" dur="1.29">Why not? It&amp;#39;s free.</text><text start="481.68" dur="2.07">All right, so we gotta talk about updates.</text><text start="483.75" dur="2.7">So number four is support.</text><text start="486.45" dur="2.04">So this is something that I would classify</text><text start="488.49" dur="1.08">as kind of underrated,</text><text start="489.57" dur="2.31">just because I don&amp;#39;t think enough people</text><text start="491.88" dur="2.58">buy their new phone that
they plan on having for years</text><text start="494.46" dur="0.93">with this in mind.</text><text start="495.39" dur="1.98">I think having the latest
and greatest updates,</text><text start="497.37" dur="3.004">software, and security
patches as quick as possible</text><text start="500.374" dur="3.476">and as long as possible
should be a priority,</text><text start="503.85" dur="1.95">but it usually isn&amp;#39;t for people.</text><text start="505.8" dur="2.94">Either way, it&amp;#39;s kind of a
mixed bag across the board.</text><text start="508.74" dur="2.356">In Android world, some
companies make no promises</text><text start="511.096" dur="2.174">or they kind of break their promises.</text><text start="513.27" dur="4.02">Some have short promises and
some will actually extend out</text><text start="517.29" dur="3.42">to promising three to four
years of software updates.</text><text start="520.71" dur="1.32">Weirdly, Samsung right now</text><text start="522.03" dur="2.64">is the undisputed king of
Android software updates,</text><text start="524.67" dur="2.73">with some rumors of maybe
Google catching back up,</text><text start="527.4" dur="1.92">but Samsung announced in 2019</text><text start="529.32" dur="2.85">that all devices in 2019 or later</text><text start="532.17" dur="2.34">will get four years of security updates</text><text start="534.51" dur="2.34">and some flagships will even get five,</text><text start="536.85" dur="3.84">but none of them really
come close to the iPhone.</text><text start="540.69" dur="2.19">When iOS 17 comes out this fall,</text><text start="542.88" dur="4.35">every iPhone back to
the iPhone 10R from 2018</text><text start="547.23" dur="2.88">is officially supported and
gonna get the latest version.</text><text start="550.11" dur="3.095">That&amp;#39;s five major
software version updates.</text><text start="553.205" dur="4.315">I don&amp;#39;t think there are any
Android phones from 2018</text><text start="557.52" dur="2.28">that are gonna get the
latest version of Android 14</text><text start="559.8" dur="0.833">when it comes out.</text><text start="560.633" dur="1.897">So this one easily goes</text><text start="562.53" dur="2.07">to the vertically-integrated Apple phone</text><text start="564.6" dur="2.01">with the Apple software all day.</text><text start="566.61" dur="3.695">So, now, my number five category is apps.</text><text start="570.305" dur="2.365">This one is actually kind of fascinating.</text><text start="572.67" dur="2.16">So, obviously, we have our standard,</text><text start="574.83" dur="2.82">like our apps that we
all use every single day</text><text start="577.65" dur="1.47">on our phones that we&amp;#39;re used to,</text><text start="579.12" dur="1.14">but then sometimes it&amp;#39;s fun</text><text start="580.26" dur="2.512">just sort of popping around
in the respective app stores,</text><text start="582.772" dur="3.458">discovering new things, finding fun apps,</text><text start="586.23" dur="2.82">and, at this point, they
are both flourishing.</text><text start="589.05" dur="1.23">There&amp;#39;s millions of apps now.</text><text start="590.28" dur="2.28">There&amp;#39;s over three and a half million apps</text><text start="592.56" dur="1.5">in the Google Play Store,</text><text start="594.06" dur="3.18">and over a million and a
half in Apple&amp;#39;s App Store,</text><text start="597.24" dur="3.39">which if you just stop there,
looks like a win for Android,</text><text start="600.63" dur="3.72">but quality over quantity, my friends.</text><text start="604.35" dur="1.11">Quality over quantity.</text><text start="605.46" dur="3.72">Basically, every major app is
available for both platforms,</text><text start="609.18" dur="0.833">which means there are many
more, you know, niche apps</text><text start="610.013" dur="4.24">or relatively unknown
possible diamonds in the rough</text><text start="614.253" dur="3.177">on the Google Play Store,
sure, but the difference is</text><text start="617.43" dur="2.49">when you actually talk to these developers</text><text start="619.92" dur="1.47">and observe the cycle of, like,</text><text start="621.39" dur="2.79">how they get made and how
these apps get updated,</text><text start="624.18" dur="4.02">the truth is so many of
them are prioritizing iOS,</text><text start="628.2" dur="1.98">and, really, it&amp;#39;s purely for efficiency.</text><text start="630.18" dur="0.833">Think about it.</text><text start="631.013" dur="2.754">If you just have to update
one version of your app</text><text start="633.767" dur="2.653">and it works with all the
newest iPhones instantly</text><text start="636.42" dur="1.95">and works perfectly for millions of people</text><text start="638.37" dur="1.87">who all have basically
the same aspect ratio,</text><text start="640.24" dur="2.18">of course you&amp;#39;d do it, flip that switch,</text><text start="642.42" dur="0.87">but, with Android,</text><text start="643.29" dur="2.31">there are naturally
many more complexities.</text><text start="645.6" dur="1.59">There are a bunch of different devices</text><text start="647.19" dur="1.62">that all have different aspect ratios</text><text start="648.81" dur="1.26">and different pixel densities</text><text start="650.07" dur="2.67">and different feature
support and even foldables,</text><text start="652.74" dur="2.04">and it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s a lot more work</text><text start="654.78" dur="2.37">to get all of those users up to date</text><text start="657.15" dur="1.83">with the same level of optimization.</text><text start="658.98" dur="1.92">It&amp;#39;s a lot of different switches to flip,</text><text start="660.9" dur="2.07">so a lot of &amp;#39;em just don&amp;#39;t
go through all of that</text><text start="662.97" dur="1.35">or they take way longer to.</text><text start="664.32" dur="2.25">So the number of titles is one thing,</text><text start="666.57" dur="4.76">but is it the same Instagram
app on both iPhone and Android?</text><text start="671.33" dur="2.481">Is it the same Threads app on each one?</text><text start="673.811" dur="2.629">As someone who&amp;#39;s been
carrying and using both phones</text><text start="676.44" dur="1.98">and often using the
same app on both phones,</text><text start="678.42" dur="3.86">I have a firsthand experience
of knowing that, often,</text><text start="682.28" dur="2.8">even with some of Google&amp;#39;s own apps,</text><text start="685.08" dur="2.46">the updates are prioritized on the iPhone.</text><text start="687.54" dur="2.603">They come first to the iPhone
before they come to Android.</text><text start="690.143" dur="1.447">I wish that wasn&amp;#39;t true.</text><text start="691.59" dur="2.58">I wish they were just as
easy to do one or the other,</text><text start="694.17" dur="1.56">but that&amp;#39;s just the truth of it.</text><text start="695.73" dur="2.79">So the slight app advantage is
gonna go to the iPhone here,</text><text start="698.52" dur="1.02">and interestingly enough,</text><text start="699.54" dur="3.75">this also applies
generally to accessories.</text><text start="703.29" dur="2.445">Again, same reason, same efficiency,</text><text start="705.735" dur="1.515">but that&amp;#39;s a win for the iPhone.</text><text start="707.25" dur="1.89">So then, category number six,</text><text start="709.14" dur="2.58">I&amp;#39;m gonna go a little more
subjective with this one,</text><text start="711.72" dur="3.12">but I still think it
matters, which is excitement.</text><text start="714.84" dur="3.225">Which one is more interesting or exciting</text><text start="718.065" dur="1.665">in the moment to you?</text><text start="719.73" dur="1.53">Now, honestly, I get pretty excited</text><text start="721.26" dur="2.55">for a lot of different
new tech these days,</text><text start="723.81" dur="1.35">and, actually, because there&amp;#39;s only</text><text start="725.16" dur="2.1">like one or two new
iPhone drops every year,</text><text start="727.26" dur="1.2">it&amp;#39;s actually very easy</text><text start="728.46" dur="2.34">to get hype built up for the new iPhone,</text><text start="730.8" dur="2.67">but it&amp;#39;s definitely a
different type of excitement</text><text start="733.47" dur="3">with the massive variety of
new innovations and things</text><text start="736.47" dur="2.13">that come to Android phones all the time.</text><text start="738.6" dur="3.12">Like, if you just are
interested in folding phones,</text><text start="741.72" dur="2.52">well, there&amp;#39;s more Android
releases than ever for that.</text><text start="744.24" dur="2.73">Want a gaming phone? There&amp;#39;s
gonna be an Android for that.</text><text start="746.97" dur="2.67">Do you want a headphone jack?
Do you want a compact phone?</text><text start="749.64" dur="2.58">Do you want the world&amp;#39;s fastest charging?</text><text start="752.22" dur="2.25">Do you want some interesting
new unique designs</text><text start="754.47" dur="2.55">or materials or textures
or experimental features?</text><text start="757.02" dur="1.8">Like, that is the world of Android,</text><text start="758.82" dur="2.52">and if you think about it,
seriously think about this,</text><text start="761.34" dur="2.43">most of the interesting excitement</text><text start="763.77" dur="3.48">around every new iPhone
launch, the question really is,</text><text start="767.25" dur="3.27">is this new iPhone going
to get a new feature</text><text start="770.52" dur="2.94">that&amp;#39;s been in Android phones for years?</text><text start="773.46" dur="3.226">Like, are we finally gonna
get USB-C on an iPhone?</text><text start="776.686" dur="3.189">Are we finally gonna get
fast charging on an iPhone?</text><text start="779.875" dur="2.878">Are we finally gonna get a 5x camera?</text><text start="782.753" dur="3.26">And so just for that novelty reason alone,</text><text start="786.013" dur="2.027">the excitement category,</text><text start="788.04" dur="1.41">that&amp;#39;s definitely gotta go to Android.</text><text start="789.45" dur="2.22">So that brings us to my last category,</text><text start="791.67" dur="3.09">number seven, ecosystem.</text><text start="794.76" dur="2.13">We&amp;#39;ve heard this word before, ecosystem.</text><text start="796.89" dur="2.25">So, okay, say what you want,</text><text start="799.14" dur="3.64">but there are a lot of people
who will not buy a phone</text><text start="802.78" dur="4.43">if it doesn&amp;#39;t have iMessage
or FaceTime, whatever it is,</text><text start="807.21" dur="3.54">and Apple has weaponized this
and built walls around this</text><text start="810.75" dur="1.98">and closed it off as much as possible.</text><text start="812.73" dur="2.43">Technically, you can join a
FaceTime from an Android phone,</text><text start="815.16" dur="1.41">but you can&amp;#39;t start one.</text><text start="816.57" dur="2.97">So I made an entire video
just about Apple&amp;#39;s ecosystem.</text><text start="819.54" dur="2.7">Hate it or love it, it is
important to some people.</text><text start="822.24" dur="1.35">Now, the thing is</text><text start="823.59" dur="2.97">Apple is not the only
one with an ecosystem.</text><text start="826.56" dur="1.95">Like, look at Samsung for example.</text><text start="828.51" dur="2.4">Apple happens to build bigger walls</text><text start="830.91" dur="2.67">around keeping people
into their ecosystem,</text><text start="833.58" dur="3.69">but Samsung has a lot of
equivalents to all the same pieces.</text><text start="837.27" dur="2.73">Like, you could get a
Samsung Galaxy S flagship</text><text start="840" dur="1.08">and you could quickly and easily</text><text start="841.08" dur="2.43">connect your Galaxy
Buds just like AirPods.</text><text start="843.51" dur="1.83">You put on your Galaxy watch</text><text start="845.34" dur="2.25">with a lot of the same
features as the Apple watch.</text><text start="847.59" dur="3.03">You tether to a Samsung Tab
just for entertainment purposes,</text><text start="850.62" dur="3.39">like an iPad, but then
you get a Galaxy Book Pro</text><text start="854.01" dur="2.88">with cellular internet sharing
and wireless Quick Share,</text><text start="856.89" dur="1.59">just like a MacBook Pro with AirDrop.</text><text start="858.48" dur="2.13">You see where I&amp;#39;m going? It
just keeps going and going.</text><text start="860.61" dur="2.07">I&amp;#39;m sure Samsung is
eventually gonna come out</text><text start="862.68" dur="2.19">with their smart speaker
to match the home pod.</text><text start="864.87" dur="2.85">It&amp;#39;s totally, totally
coming, but on paper,</text><text start="867.72" dur="2.82">the idea is they are
surprisingly congruent.</text><text start="870.54" dur="2.13">So, the way I see it, at
the time of this recording,</text><text start="872.67" dur="2.19">&amp;#39;cause this could change very
soon in the next couple weeks,</text><text start="874.86" dur="3.21">but the main advantages
of Samsung&amp;#39;s ecosystem</text><text start="878.07" dur="4.11">would be things like one USB-C
across literally everything,</text><text start="882.18" dur="3.21">so you can use one charging
cable for all of your stuff.</text><text start="885.39" dur="2.682">Two, they make more
different versions of devices</text><text start="888.072" dur="1.728">that fit into the ecosystem.</text><text start="889.8" dur="2.46">Like, there are a ton of different phones</text><text start="892.26" dur="1.56">and a bunch of different watches</text><text start="893.82" dur="2.28">and different headphones
and laptops, et cetera,</text><text start="896.1" dur="2.49">so there&amp;#39;s more flexibility
and hardware choice.</text><text start="898.59" dur="2.22">Classic Android, plus Samsung
also makes other stuff</text><text start="900.81" dur="3">that connects, like
dishwashers and refrigerators,</text><text start="903.81" dur="2.463">but then the advantages
of Apple&amp;#39;s ecosystem,</text><text start="906.273" dur="2.877">not just in the US, but especially here,</text><text start="909.15" dur="2.91">are, first of all, ease
of use and seamlessness.</text><text start="912.06" dur="2.43">Like, it is genuinely crazy how good</text><text start="914.49" dur="2.49">some of the continuity stuff
is in Apple&amp;#39;s ecosystem.</text><text start="916.98" dur="2.07">Like, something like Continuity Camera</text><text start="919.05" dur="1.98">is so sick every time.</text><text start="921.03" dur="1.05">You just push one button</text><text start="922.08" dur="3.42">to use a super high quality
iPhone camera as your webcam.</text><text start="925.5" dur="1.77">It works very, very well,</text><text start="927.27" dur="3.99">but then the popularity
factor, especially in the US,</text><text start="931.26" dur="2.735">makes things like FaceTime and iMessage</text><text start="933.995" dur="3.115">and the Find My Network super strong.</text><text start="937.11" dur="1.17">So I can make a whole video on this.</text><text start="938.28" dur="1.83">I could put up the
strengths and weaknesses</text><text start="940.11" dur="4.32">and put up just these two
ecosystems up against each other,</text><text start="944.43" dur="2.962">but, as of right now,
they&amp;#39;re both very strong,</text><text start="947.392" dur="3.338">and I&amp;#39;m gonna give the
slight edge to Apple&amp;#39;s,</text><text start="950.73" dur="1.92">just because, one, I&amp;#39;m in the US</text><text start="952.65" dur="1.44">and that advantage is strong,</text><text start="954.09" dur="1.65">but, two, just because of the seamlessness</text><text start="955.74" dur="1.29">and how well things are integrated</text><text start="957.03" dur="2.31">and the continuity features are unreal.</text><text start="959.34" dur="1.62">So, if we tally these all up here,</text><text start="960.96" dur="2.58">you can see that the objective winner,</text><text start="963.54" dur="2.97">in four out of the seven
categories that I made up,</text><text start="966.51" dur="3.63">is the iPhone, but put
your pitchforks down.</text><text start="970.14" dur="0.833">Guess what?</text><text start="971.969" dur="1.291">As you&amp;#39;ve probably picked up</text><text start="973.26" dur="0.833">from the beginning of this video,</text><text start="974.093" dur="1.837">there is no objective winner</text><text start="975.93" dur="2.13">to a decision as personal as this one</text><text start="978.06" dur="1.83">and when the options are this close.</text><text start="979.89" dur="0.833">You probably already know,</text><text start="980.723" dur="0.997">if you&amp;#39;ve been watching my videos,</text><text start="981.72" dur="1.26">you know I main an Android phone</text><text start="982.98" dur="3.077">most of the time alongside an iPhone,</text><text start="986.057" dur="3.099">but my main phone and my
main customized setups</text><text start="989.156" dur="2.284">are on the Android phone, so what gives?</text><text start="991.44" dur="3.54">Like, picking one de facto
winner kind of suggests that</text><text start="994.98" dur="2.349">the one winner is best for everyone,</text><text start="997.329" dur="4.341">but we already know that there&amp;#39;s
some people who literally</text><text start="1001.67" dur="2.25">don&amp;#39;t care about some features</text><text start="1003.92" dur="2.58">that some others would say
they can&amp;#39;t live without.</text><text start="1006.5" dur="2.19">So I&amp;#39;ve devised a very basic system</text><text start="1008.69" dur="3.067">to help you pick your winner for yourself,</text><text start="1011.757" dur="1.763">and it&amp;#39;s really quite simple.</text><text start="1013.52" dur="1.26">All you have to do</text><text start="1014.78" dur="5">is put these seven categories
in order of importance to you</text><text start="1019.79" dur="1.77">and then rate each one of them</text><text start="1021.56" dur="1.47">let&amp;#39;s say on a scale from one to five.</text><text start="1023.03" dur="2.64">So give them a one to five point rating</text><text start="1025.67" dur="2.22">based on how much you care about it.</text><text start="1027.89" dur="2.7">So, here, for me, I care the most about</text><text start="1030.59" dur="2.43">customization and features.</text><text start="1033.02" dur="1.41">Then I care a lot about apps,</text><text start="1034.43" dur="2.55">and excitement and updates
are decently important,</text><text start="1036.98" dur="1.5">but then in my daily driver,</text><text start="1038.48" dur="2.49">ease of use and ecosystem
aren&amp;#39;t that big of a deal.</text><text start="1040.97" dur="1.5">I&amp;#39;ve got a mixed bag.</text><text start="1042.47" dur="2.67">So then I just give the
amount of points earned</text><text start="1045.14" dur="1.71">to each winner of that category.</text><text start="1046.85" dur="3.159">So the winner for me is clearly Android,</text><text start="1050.009" dur="1.44">but, hey, for you,</text><text start="1051.449" dur="3.531">maybe you care a lot about
ecosystem and maybe nothing else.</text><text start="1054.98" dur="2.07">I&amp;#39;m sure you know someone like this.</text><text start="1057.05" dur="2.495">Then the iPhone will clearly
be calling your name,</text><text start="1059.545" dur="2.035">or if you&amp;#39;re the type who wants</text><text start="1061.58" dur="2.61">all the features and
excitement in the world,</text><text start="1064.19" dur="2.4">well, then Android probably
is what&amp;#39;s in your pocket.</text><text start="1066.59" dur="2.04">You might even have your own
category you could add in</text><text start="1068.63" dur="1.38">that&amp;#39;s heavily weighted.</text><text start="1070.01" dur="1.56">I kind of see it like buying a car.</text><text start="1071.57" dur="2.46">Like maybe Cool Factor
is in there. Have at it.</text><text start="1074.03" dur="1.2">It turns out buying a phone</text><text start="1075.23" dur="3.42">is one of the most personal
decisions you make.</text><text start="1078.65" dur="0.96">I&amp;#39;ve said this before, but, like,</text><text start="1079.61" dur="1.86">it&amp;#39;s the thing you spent your money on</text><text start="1081.47" dur="1.77">and you carry everywhere you go,</text><text start="1083.24" dur="1.98">and so that&amp;#39;s why people
get so worked up about</text><text start="1085.22" dur="1.62">this side versus that side,</text><text start="1086.84" dur="1.62">but, at the end of the day,</text><text start="1088.46" dur="2.943">the winner, not to be cheesy, is us,</text><text start="1091.403" dur="3.237">because they&amp;#39;re competing
against each other to get better</text><text start="1094.64" dur="3.123">to hopefully win you over, and
that&amp;#39;s the way it should be.</text><text start="1098.69" dur="1.333">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="1100.023" dur="1.718">Catch you in the next one.</text><text start="1101.741" dur="0.833">Peace.</text><text start="1102.574" dur="4.074">(upbeat music)
