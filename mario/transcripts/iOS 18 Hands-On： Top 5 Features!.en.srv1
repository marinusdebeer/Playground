(groovy hip-hop music)</text><text start="3.12" dur="2.76">- All right, it&amp;#39;s mid-2024,
so you know what that means,</text><text start="5.88" dur="3.3">another new version of iOS
coming to an iPhone near you.</text><text start="9.18" dur="3.57">So, I&amp;#39;ve been testing the
newest version of iOS 18</text><text start="12.75" dur="2.28">on my iPhone for the
past couple weeks now.</text><text start="15.03" dur="2.4">It&amp;#39;s been in beta, and now
that the public beta&amp;#39;s out,</text><text start="17.43" dur="2.43">you too can test it on an iPhone</text><text start="19.86" dur="2.04">before it comes out for
everyone in September.</text><text start="21.9" dur="2.7">But there is some interesting
stuff in this version.</text><text start="24.6" dur="2.28">Now, last year, I
remember talking about how</text><text start="26.88" dur="2.4">almost every single one
of those new features</text><text start="29.28" dur="2.49">was super ecosystem-based.</text><text start="31.77" dur="2.82">Like, they would depend on
having a friend with an iPhone</text><text start="34.59" dur="2.37">or having some other
Apple device in your life,</text><text start="36.96" dur="1.41">but it&amp;#39;s kinda the opposite with these.</text><text start="38.37" dur="2.13">They&amp;#39;re all just basically new features</text><text start="40.5" dur="1.2">to the iPhone, anyway.</text><text start="41.7" dur="1.02">So I love to see that.</text><text start="42.72" dur="2.04">Now, for this video, the
one thing I&amp;#39;m leaving out</text><text start="44.76" dur="2.76">is Apple Intelligence stuff.</text><text start="47.52" dur="2.55">That&amp;#39;s like an entire
separate bucket of stuff</text><text start="50.07" dur="1.71">that, to be honest, hasn&amp;#39;t really</text><text start="51.78" dur="2.52">been available for me to test
in the pre-release betas.</text><text start="54.3" dur="3.6">So I&amp;#39;m gonna make a separate
video just about that stuff</text><text start="57.9" dur="1.74">as soon as it&amp;#39;s actually testable.</text><text start="59.64" dur="1.59">So be sure to get subscribed to see that</text><text start="61.23" dur="1.98">when I actually drop that video.</text><text start="63.21" dur="3.69">But this video is the top
five of everything else.</text><text start="66.9" dur="2.97">All right, number five,
the new Control Center.</text><text start="69.87" dur="1.32">So I have this at number five</text><text start="71.19" dur="3.48">because while there is a good
amount of new stuff here,</text><text start="74.67" dur="2.91">I don&amp;#39;t know if I like
all of the new changes,</text><text start="77.58" dur="1.17">but let me know what you think.</text><text start="78.75" dur="1.47">So when you pull down from the corner,</text><text start="80.22" dur="1.08">the new Control Center</text><text start="81.3" dur="2.28">is, first of all, a
little bit more colorful,</text><text start="83.58" dur="2.16">and it&amp;#39;s paginated, it&amp;#39;s three pages now.</text><text start="85.74" dur="1.83">I&amp;#39;ll honestly probably never really use</text><text start="87.57" dur="3.27">the second two pages, but they
are a full-page visualizer</text><text start="90.84" dur="1.17">for whatever media is playing.</text><text start="92.01" dur="3.39">And then a list of all
these one-touch toggles</text><text start="95.4" dur="1.38">for your basic connectivity.</text><text start="96.78" dur="1.92">But actually turns out this full-page list</text><text start="98.7" dur="1.74">is really just an expanded version</text><text start="100.44" dur="2.1">of what you already had on the first page,</text><text start="102.54" dur="2.01">so you can get there
with a couple more taps.</text><text start="104.55" dur="1.53">But okay, so on that first page,</text><text start="106.08" dur="2.85">if you hit the plus button in
the corner, it shows a grid,</text><text start="108.93" dur="1.29">and then you can play with the size</text><text start="110.22" dur="1.98">and placement of anything that has</text><text start="112.2" dur="1.62">a tab in that bottom corner.</text><text start="113.82" dur="2.07">So they all kind of have
these predefined sizes</text><text start="115.89" dur="1.35">that they morph between.</text><text start="117.24" dur="2.13">So you can mess around
here with, you know,</text><text start="119.37" dur="1.98">basically designing your perfect layout</text><text start="121.35" dur="1.29">for your control screen.</text><text start="122.64" dur="1.26">You can add new controls,</text><text start="123.9" dur="1.35">and there&amp;#39;s a whole massive list of them</text><text start="125.25" dur="3.33">to search through here and
surface things that you do often.</text><text start="128.58" dur="3.84">And right now, these are
basically all Apple app controls.</text><text start="132.42" dur="2.13">What I&amp;#39;m more interested in, though, is...</text><text start="134.55" dur="2.04">I mean, these are all
controls, like I said,</text><text start="136.59" dur="0.93">not widgets.</text><text start="137.52" dur="2.01">So, they&amp;#39;re for controlling
things very directly,</text><text start="139.53" dur="3.6">like turning on wifi or
turning up the brightness.</text><text start="143.13" dur="1.83">And so Apple has said
that third-party apps</text><text start="144.96" dur="2.13">are gonna be able to build
in controls, as well.</text><text start="147.09" dur="2.7">So there&amp;#39;s none here now,
but I very much look forward</text><text start="149.79" dur="3.6">to like a one-touch turning
on the AC in the car</text><text start="153.39" dur="2.88">or one-touch opening
up the barcode scanner</text><text start="156.27" dur="2.01">in my calorie tracker app
or something like that.</text><text start="158.28" dur="3.422">So just having more
controls surface in here,</text><text start="161.702" dur="1.168">that&amp;#39;s gonna be pretty sweet.</text><text start="162.87" dur="2.28">We&amp;#39;ve also noticed this
new flashlight control,</text><text start="165.15" dur="2.16">which, when you click
it allows you to control</text><text start="167.31" dur="4.59">both the intensity and the
beam width of the torch</text><text start="171.9" dur="1.59">for some reason.</text><text start="173.49" dur="2.01">The intensity part definitely works.</text><text start="175.5" dur="1.05">The beam width,</text><text start="176.55" dur="1.77">I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m as
convinced on that one,</text><text start="178.32" dur="2.13">but I guess it&amp;#39;s still a really cool UI.</text><text start="180.45" dur="1.8">Oh, also, there&amp;#39;s a new button up here</text><text start="182.25" dur="1.08">to turn off your phone,</text><text start="183.33" dur="2.73">kinda like Android added a
while ago in the settings.</text><text start="186.06" dur="3.69">But also, you can now
finally change the controls</text><text start="189.75" dur="1.59">on your lock screen now.</text><text start="191.34" dur="1.89">From the default, which
have been the flashlight</text><text start="193.23" dur="2.88">and the camera for
forever, you can hold down,</text><text start="196.11" dur="1.86">customize, lock screen,</text><text start="197.97" dur="1.8">and get in there and go to town.</text><text start="199.77" dur="1.83">Again, I hope there&amp;#39;s third-party
ones that end up here,</text><text start="201.6" dur="1.5">but there&amp;#39;s already a ton of options.</text><text start="203.1" dur="2.82">I am excited to set mine to
my to-do list app someday.</text><text start="205.92" dur="1.47">But that brings us to number four,</text><text start="207.39" dur="2.31">the number four best new iOS 18 feature</text><text start="209.7" dur="1.35">and that&amp;#39;s the Passwords app.</text><text start="211.05" dur="1.56">You know, every once in a
while, there&amp;#39;s just a new update</text><text start="212.61" dur="1.8">that installs a new app
on everyone&amp;#39;s phones</text><text start="214.41" dur="1.26">and just drops it on your home screen.</text><text start="215.67" dur="1.53">So this is one of them.</text><text start="217.2" dur="2.52">But essentially, what this
is is just breaking out</text><text start="219.72" dur="1.41">all of the password tools</text><text start="221.13" dur="2.64">that were previously buried
in the settings on the phone</text><text start="223.77" dur="1.44">and making it an app.</text><text start="225.21" dur="2.43">So your iPhone&amp;#39;s been saving
your passwords for a while now,</text><text start="227.64" dur="2.43">saving wifi passcodes,
remembering all this stuff.</text><text start="230.07" dur="1.59">This app is just a super simple way</text><text start="231.66" dur="1.53">of finding it all in one place,</text><text start="233.19" dur="2.58">searching through that stuff,
and making sense of it.</text><text start="235.77" dur="1.65">Plus, it also supports some new features.</text><text start="237.42" dur="3.24">So there&amp;#39;s two-factor
authentication and pass keys.</text><text start="240.66" dur="1.5">And then there&amp;#39;s a couple
extra things on top</text><text start="242.16" dur="3.09">that may be good enough
to get you to switch</text><text start="245.25" dur="1.77">from whatever password manager app</text><text start="247.02" dur="3.36">you&amp;#39;re using on your iPhone
to Apple&amp;#39;s Passwords app.</text><text start="250.38" dur="2.85">So, at the bottom left, you
can create shared passwords</text><text start="253.23" dur="3.09">and pass keys within a
group of trusted contacts.</text><text start="256.32" dur="1.83">Works with other people
with iPhones, anyway.</text><text start="258.15" dur="0.833">And then, when you&amp;#39;re signing up</text><text start="258.983" dur="1.537">for some new account somewhere,</text><text start="260.52" dur="1.26">it&amp;#39;ll do the same thing it always does.</text><text start="261.78" dur="1.98">It offers a super secure password</text><text start="263.76" dur="1.71">and then offers to remember it for you.</text><text start="265.47" dur="1.41">But what I found interesting is</text><text start="266.88" dur="2.61">it doesn&amp;#39;t really have,
like, a master password,</text><text start="269.49" dur="3">it just seems on the iPhone
to default to Face ID.</text><text start="272.49" dur="2.4">So if you&amp;#39;ve got face ID on your iPhone,</text><text start="274.89" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;ll ask for that to log
in, no master password.</text><text start="278.34" dur="2.31">Really, the main reason I&amp;#39;m
not gonna be using this app</text><text start="280.65" dur="2.61">is because I stole daily an Android phone,</text><text start="283.26" dur="2.82">and, of course, they did
not make an Android version</text><text start="286.08" dur="1.05">of this Passwords app.</text><text start="287.13" dur="1.29">They did make a Mac app,</text><text start="288.42" dur="2.43">and they also did make a Chrome extension,</text><text start="290.85" dur="0.833">which is interesting.</text><text start="291.683" dur="1.537">But yeah, no Android app,</text><text start="293.22" dur="1.71">and I still log into a
bunch of stuff on Android,</text><text start="294.93" dur="1.77">so it&amp;#39;s not for me.</text><text start="296.7" dur="3.21">But number three is gonna have to be</text><text start="299.91" dur="2.31">the new home screen customization.</text><text start="302.22" dur="1.77">Some of you might&amp;#39;ve
expected this to be higher,</text><text start="303.99" dur="2.91">like number one or number
two, but I have my reasons,</text><text start="306.9" dur="2.16">and maybe let me know
if you agree with them.</text><text start="309.06" dur="1.38">So, the day has finally come.</text><text start="310.44" dur="3.24">There is new customization stuff available</text><text start="313.68" dur="1.62">to iPhone home screens, kinda.</text><text start="315.3" dur="2.31">I mean, there&amp;#39;s some good stuff
and also some weird stuff.</text><text start="317.61" dur="1.14">I&amp;#39;ll start with the stuff I like.</text><text start="318.75" dur="1.08">Here&amp;#39;s the easy part:</text><text start="319.83" dur="3.24">iPhone users can now put their icons</text><text start="323.07" dur="3.543">anywhere on their home
screens that they want.</text><text start="327.93" dur="1.98">Welcome to 2024, iPhone users.</text><text start="329.91" dur="1.2">Who&amp;#39;s got it better than you?</text><text start="331.11" dur="2.58">Now, everything still snaps
to the grid, of course,</text><text start="333.69" dur="3.42">but now you can actually
put icons on the right side</text><text start="337.11" dur="1.83">or the bottom of your home screen</text><text start="338.94" dur="1.17">where they&amp;#39;ll actually be reachable,</text><text start="340.11" dur="1.86">and they won&amp;#39;t have to
snap back up to the top.</text><text start="341.97" dur="0.87">How cool is that?</text><text start="342.84" dur="2.04">First, they give you widgets,
now they give you this.</text><text start="344.88" dur="0.84">It&amp;#39;s unbelievable stuff.</text><text start="345.72" dur="2.49">But now, okay, if you wanna
customize even further,</text><text start="348.21" dur="2.25">you hold down on anywhere
on the home screen,</text><text start="350.46" dur="1.8">and there&amp;#39;s a little
edit button at the top.</text><text start="352.26" dur="2.13">You hit that, and then you hit customize,</text><text start="354.39" dur="1.5">and then this is it.</text><text start="355.89" dur="2.73">This is the entire home
screen customization menu now</text><text start="358.62" dur="0.833">for the iPhone.</text><text start="359.453" dur="2.557">So you can go dark mode,</text><text start="362.01" dur="1.77">which tints your
wallpaper a little darker,</text><text start="363.78" dur="1.08">and then sets your icons</text><text start="364.86" dur="1.86">that have a dark mode
version to dark mode.</text><text start="366.72" dur="1.83">Or you could set light
mode, which is the opposite.</text><text start="368.55" dur="1.26">It sets your icons to light,</text><text start="369.81" dur="2.31">and it tints your wallpaper
light, and they&amp;#39;re automatic.</text><text start="372.12" dur="2.01">But there&amp;#39;s also this large button here,</text><text start="374.13" dur="2.61">which just makes all of your icons larger,</text><text start="376.74" dur="1.47">but then also removes the text.</text><text start="378.21" dur="1.71">Honestly, kind of clean, not gonna lie.</text><text start="379.92" dur="1.5">But then there&amp;#39;s this tinted button,</text><text start="381.42" dur="1.74">which feels kind of cursed.</text><text start="383.16" dur="3.54">So this is already kind
of a weird-looking icon.</text><text start="386.7" dur="2.28">When you click it, it
lets you tint the color</text><text start="388.98" dur="2.04">of all the icons on your home screen</text><text start="391.02" dur="2.46">to a single matching color.</text><text start="393.48" dur="4.14">Which sounds kind of cool in
theory to match your wallpaper.</text><text start="397.62" dur="2.52">And actually, there&amp;#39;s even a color picker</text><text start="400.14" dur="2.22">to drop exactly the same color</text><text start="402.36" dur="3.39">that you&amp;#39;re using from your
wallpaper as your tint color.</text><text start="405.75" dur="2.7">But there&amp;#39;s just something about this tint</text><text start="408.45" dur="2.25">that I can&amp;#39;t quite get right.</text><text start="410.7" dur="2.28">Like, I haven&amp;#39;t gotten any combination</text><text start="412.98" dur="1.86">to really look that good at all.</text><text start="414.84" dur="3.42">Now, there&amp;#39;s been some updates
on this since the first beta.</text><text start="418.26" dur="2.25">Still doesn&amp;#39;t look great.</text><text start="420.51" dur="1.17">Like, it looks better than before.</text><text start="421.68" dur="2.43">But here&amp;#39;s what I think is going on here.</text><text start="424.11" dur="3.15">There are certain apps that
are, like, pretty simple</text><text start="427.26" dur="3.09">and high-contrast icons that look fine.</text><text start="430.35" dur="1.23">Like, some of them are Apple apps,</text><text start="431.58" dur="1.56">some of them are third-party apps,</text><text start="433.14" dur="2.34">and then especially Apple widgets.</text><text start="435.48" dur="1.35">Like, look at this weather widget.</text><text start="436.83" dur="1.29">That looks great.</text><text start="438.12" dur="2.28">That looks really solid
with this nice accent color</text><text start="440.4" dur="1.74">because it keeps
everything really readable.</text><text start="442.14" dur="2.76">But then there are also
some third-party app icons</text><text start="444.9" dur="2.73">and widgets that just
look completely illegible.</text><text start="447.63" dur="1.98">Like, they may need to be updated</text><text start="449.61" dur="3.9">to support this tinting thing
in a more contrasty way.</text><text start="453.51" dur="3.42">So it&amp;#39;s the mixing of
these two that look weird.</text><text start="456.93" dur="2.1">Like even on my home
screen, look at CARROT,</text><text start="459.03" dur="2.28">like the weather app, or Superlist,</text><text start="461.31" dur="1.56">they look worse than the rest of the icons</text><text start="462.87" dur="0.833">on my home screen.</text><text start="463.703" dur="1.717">I think the standard
that they&amp;#39;re aiming for</text><text start="465.42" dur="1.47">is, like, a dark gray background</text><text start="466.89" dur="1.5">with a tinted glyph in the middle,</text><text start="468.39" dur="1.92">instead of the whole thing being tinted.</text><text start="470.31" dur="0.9">So it is what it is.</text><text start="471.21" dur="2.04">I will also say Google has also tried this</text><text start="473.25" dur="2.46">with Material You in Android,</text><text start="475.71" dur="1.59">and it also kind of went weird</text><text start="477.3" dur="1.65">in its own different, unique way.</text><text start="478.95" dur="1.47">Basically, it would set all the icons</text><text start="480.42" dur="2.79">to a monochrome version, but
if an app didn&amp;#39;t support it,</text><text start="483.21" dur="1.53">it just didn&amp;#39;t change.</text><text start="484.74" dur="2.28">So a lot of people had a
mix of monochrome icons</text><text start="487.02" dur="3.09">and colorful icons, which
also doesn&amp;#39;t look good at all.</text><text start="490.11" dur="1.92">So, I guess the tinting method</text><text start="492.03" dur="1.62">could be considered a workaround.</text><text start="493.65" dur="1.62">I&amp;#39;m sure people will play with this more.</text><text start="495.27" dur="1.86">Icons will continue to get updates.</text><text start="497.13" dur="2.19">I&amp;#39;m sure someday maybe it&amp;#39;ll
look great for some people,</text><text start="499.32" dur="1.65">but I haven&amp;#39;t seen that yet.</text><text start="500.97" dur="3.33">But all right, number two,
for me, is the little things.</text><text start="504.3" dur="2.01">Again, there are a bunch
of tiny little things</text><text start="506.31" dur="2.85">and small features that
individually are not huge,</text><text start="509.16" dur="2.01">but they&amp;#39;ll kind of feel like they add up</text><text start="511.17" dur="2.43">to a bunch of useful things in the end.</text><text start="513.6" dur="1.35">A lot of them didn&amp;#39;t
even make the keynote.</text><text start="514.95" dur="2.43">But, like, game mode, for
example, they talked about this.</text><text start="517.38" dur="1.44">We know that when you have a game open,</text><text start="518.82" dur="3.51">it gives it CPU priority and
minimizes Bluetooth latency</text><text start="522.33" dur="2.58">for any wireless
headphones or controllers.</text><text start="524.91" dur="2.25">That&amp;#39;s a really simple
thing, but it&amp;#39;s nice.</text><text start="527.16" dur="1.83">The Photos app also got a redesign,</text><text start="528.99" dur="2.34">but I also am more impressed
with the smart search</text><text start="531.33" dur="1.17">inside of Photos.</text><text start="532.5" dur="0.96">It works much better.</text><text start="533.46" dur="3.66">So if I search for, like
&amp;quot;license plate,&amp;quot; for example,</text><text start="537.12" dur="1.38">not only does it recognize</text><text start="538.5" dur="2.7">and find all the photos in your
gallery with license plates,</text><text start="541.2" dur="2.52">but it also gives you these
suggestions to narrow it down</text><text start="543.72" dur="2.37">to find the exact one
that you&amp;#39;re looking for,</text><text start="546.09" dur="0.99">and it actually works.</text><text start="547.08" dur="2.07">I&amp;#39;ve also noticed they
added a bunch of shortcuts</text><text start="549.15" dur="4.2">to Shazam everywhere, including
an Action button preset</text><text start="553.35" dur="2.13">as one of the new defaults
in the Settings app.</text><text start="555.48" dur="0.93">This wasn&amp;#39;t here before.</text><text start="556.41" dur="0.93">I thought that was interesting.</text><text start="557.34" dur="2.58">And then I Googled it, and
apparently, Apple bought Shazam</text><text start="559.92" dur="2.34">not that long ago, which
I totally forgot about.</text><text start="562.26" dur="1.35">So there you have more of that.</text><text start="563.61" dur="2.07">And RCS support</text><text start="565.68" dur="3.87">does appear to finally be live</text><text start="569.55" dur="4.59">on the iPhone in 2024. (clapping)</text><text start="574.14" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s going great.</text><text start="574.973" dur="3.487">Now, as I predicted, it
is still a green bubble,</text><text start="578.46" dur="2.49">but you can now finally text between</text><text start="580.95" dur="2.49">any modern Android phone and an iPhone</text><text start="583.44" dur="2.25">and actually get high-quality media.</text><text start="585.69" dur="2.58">I sent myself a three-megabyte
image file from the iPhone,</text><text start="588.27" dur="3.24">and I got a full-quality
three-megabyte image on Android.</text><text start="591.51" dur="1.83">And there&amp;#39;s also now typing indicators</text><text start="593.34" dur="1.35">and read receipts now.</text><text start="594.69" dur="1.56">Reactions seem to be working well.</text><text start="596.25" dur="4.23">So it&amp;#39;s not fully integrated
into a blue bubble iMessage,</text><text start="600.48" dur="1.92">like maybe some people were hoping.</text><text start="602.4" dur="3.03">But Apple can now say
that they finally did it,</text><text start="605.43" dur="3">and now that person
from that one interview</text><text start="608.43" dur="2.31">doesn&amp;#39;t have to buy his mom an iPhone.</text><text start="610.74" dur="1.59">But then number one.</text><text start="612.33" dur="3.375">The number one best new feature in iOS 18,</text><text start="615.705" dur="1.538">bro, it&amp;#39;s a calculator.</text><text start="617.243" dur="1.507">(chuckling) It&amp;#39;s actually the calculator.</text><text start="618.75" dur="1.89">Now, you might have thought
this was just an iPad thing</text><text start="620.64" dur="2.19">&amp;#39;cause we all saw this
get demoed at the keynote</text><text start="622.83" dur="4.08">in iPadOS 18, but it actually
is on the iPhone, as well.</text><text start="626.91" dur="2.76">So, as a default, you open
up the Calculator app,</text><text start="629.67" dur="1.41">it just looks like a basic calculator.</text><text start="631.08" dur="0.99">This looks very familiar.</text><text start="632.07" dur="1.98">But at the bottom left,
there&amp;#39;s this little toggle</text><text start="634.05" dur="2.55">where you can switch to
a scientific calculator.</text><text start="636.6" dur="1.56">Okay, pretty classic.</text><text start="638.16" dur="3.3">Or you can switch to this
new thing called Math Notes.</text><text start="641.46" dur="2.64">And now it basically
looks like a notes app.</text><text start="644.1" dur="1.74">So you can create a new note</text><text start="645.84" dur="3.72">and literally just start
handwriting math notes, literally.</text><text start="649.56" dur="1.83">You can write an equation,</text><text start="651.39" dur="1.62">and if you happen to
write that equal sign,</text><text start="653.01" dur="2.82">it can automatically solve
that equation for you</text><text start="655.83" dur="2.88">and keep it updated as you
continue writing or typing.</text><text start="658.71" dur="1.08">It&amp;#39;s pretty sick.</text><text start="659.79" dur="2.4">There are also all kinds
of other things it can do,</text><text start="662.19" dur="2.94">from variables to graphs.</text><text start="665.13" dur="1.56">It&amp;#39;s basically doing everything</text><text start="666.69" dur="2.25">I was asking Wolfram|Alpha to do lately.</text><text start="668.94" dur="2.22">But a kind of underrated
part of this is how</text><text start="671.16" dur="1.5">it feels very well considered,</text><text start="672.66" dur="1.77">and it&amp;#39;s also syncing across devices</text><text start="674.43" dur="1.65">just, like, as a bunch of notes.</text><text start="676.08" dur="3.15">So your calculator just kind
of gained a notes section.</text><text start="679.23" dur="2.73">So, if you add a bunch of
stuff to Notes on your iPhone,</text><text start="681.96" dur="3.21">the iPad with the calculator
has all of the same notes,</text><text start="685.17" dur="2.31">and you can edit them on the other device.</text><text start="687.48" dur="2.34">And if you happen to redefine a variable</text><text start="689.82" dur="1.68">lower down in the same note,</text><text start="691.5" dur="2.28">then it actually knows
then from that point on</text><text start="693.78" dur="3.15">to treat that variable as
the new value you gave it</text><text start="696.93" dur="2.52">but keeps the old value
for everything above it.</text><text start="699.45" dur="2.37">It&amp;#39;s very well impressively thought out.</text><text start="701.82" dur="1.5">Now, obviously, this
stuff is gonna be easier</text><text start="703.32" dur="2.97">with a bigger screen and
with an Apple Pencil.</text><text start="706.29" dur="3.66">But, man, I was doing
all this stuff in school</text><text start="709.95" dur="2.28">with a paper notebook and a TI-84.</text><text start="712.23" dur="2.13">So, at the risk of sounding kind of old,</text><text start="714.36" dur="1.65">I totally wish I had something like this</text><text start="716.01" dur="0.84">when I was in school.</text><text start="716.85" dur="1.62">It&amp;#39;s very impressive.</text><text start="718.47" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s doing so many things.</text><text start="720.15" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s recognizing my handwriting.</text><text start="721.83" dur="2.82">It&amp;#39;s obviously answering the
equations I&amp;#39;m asking of it,</text><text start="724.65" dur="3.24">but it&amp;#39;s also writing the
answers in my own handwriting</text><text start="727.89" dur="1.44">and then it&amp;#39;s straightening everything up.</text><text start="729.33" dur="2.97">And it&amp;#39;s making everything
searchable and indexable</text><text start="732.3" dur="3.12">through not just that Math
Notes app in all the devices</text><text start="735.42" dur="1.23">but across my whole phone.</text><text start="736.65" dur="2.34">So it&amp;#39;s pretty sick.</text><text start="738.99" dur="0.96">I&amp;#39;m impressed by this</text><text start="739.95" dur="1.95">more than anything else
I&amp;#39;ve seen in iOS 18.</text><text start="741.9" dur="2.7">So that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s my number
one feature in iOS 18.</text><text start="744.6" dur="1.59">But there&amp;#39;s your whole top five.</text><text start="746.19" dur="1.68">But like I said, get
subscribed to see a deep dive</text><text start="747.87" dur="1.26">into Apple Intelligence</text><text start="749.13" dur="2.13">&amp;#39;cause this is the thing
that kind of permeates</text><text start="751.26" dur="2.58">the entire iPhone and
Apple&amp;#39;s whole ecosystem.</text><text start="753.84" dur="4.14">So that video&amp;#39;s coming up soon,
and that&amp;#39;s been it for this.</text><text start="757.98" dur="1.56">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="759.54" dur="1.44">Catch you the next one.</text><text start="760.98" dur="0.833">Peace.</text></transcript>
