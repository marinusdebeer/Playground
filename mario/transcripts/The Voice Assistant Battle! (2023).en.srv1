is the Google Assistant.</text><text start="6.33" dur="1.59">- [Bixby] The name is Bixby.</text><text start="7.92" dur="1.175">- [Alexa] I&amp;#39;m Alexa.</text><text start="9.095" dur="2.425">(bright upbeat music)</text><text start="11.52" dur="1.5">- I&amp;#39;ve talked and made jokes in the past</text><text start="13.02" dur="2.82">mostly along the lines of
Google Assistant is clearly</text><text start="15.84" dur="3.45">the best virtual assistant
and then Bixby, Siri</text><text start="19.29" dur="3.09">and Alexa are various
levels of far behind.</text><text start="22.38" dur="4.08">But last time I did this
type of test was 2017</text><text start="26.46" dur="2.85">so I figured we should
revisit this a little bit,</text><text start="29.31" dur="1.89">retest things and figure out</text><text start="31.2" dur="2.43">if Google Assistant still actually is</text><text start="33.63" dur="3.45">the best virtual assistant
on a smartphone right now.</text><text start="37.08" dur="3.12">Also shout out to Clippy, the
original virtual assistant</text><text start="40.2" dur="2.1">whose ugly Christmas sweater for Microsoft</text><text start="42.3" dur="3.63">is actually what inspired
this one, the MKBHD 8-bit Drip</text><text start="45.93" dur="1.47">which you can get wall supplies last.</text><text start="47.4" dur="0.93">They&amp;#39;re very limited</text><text start="48.33" dur="2.64">but they&amp;#39;re at shop.mkbd.com, link below.</text><text start="50.97" dur="2.58">But I decided to start
with the simple questions.</text><text start="53.55" dur="2.7">You know The three things
that you ask from an assistant</text><text start="56.25" dur="4.32">the most often I think are
the weather, timers and facts.</text><text start="60.57" dur="1.92">So they all do fine with
the weather question,</text><text start="62.49" dur="2.1">probably the number one
query for me anyway.</text><text start="64.59" dur="0.84">And then for the most part,</text><text start="65.43" dur="2.22">they were also the same pretty quick</text><text start="67.65" dur="1.95">with just asking standard facts,</text><text start="69.6" dur="1.98">although for some reason they did disagree</text><text start="71.58" dur="1.92">on the height of one person.</text><text start="73.5" dur="3.72">But then for timers, for
timers, for one weird reason</text><text start="77.22" dur="3.96">Siri cannot do multiple
timers at the same time</text><text start="81.18" dur="0.84">on the iPhone.</text><text start="82.02" dur="3.24">If you have a timer running
and ask for a second timer,</text><text start="85.26" dur="2.79">it asks you every time
if you want to replace</text><text start="88.05" dur="0.9">the first timer.</text><text start="88.95" dur="0.87">Pretty basic stuff</text><text start="89.82" dur="1.153">that I&amp;#39;m not sure why
Apple hasn&amp;#39;t fixed yet.</text><text start="90.973" dur="2.867">Especially because you
can set multiple timers</text><text start="93.84" dur="3.42">at the same time with
Siri on a HomePod mini.</text><text start="97.26" dur="1.26">But anyway, I don&amp;#39;t wanna make you watch</text><text start="98.52" dur="2.46">a whole bunch of back to back
to back questions and answers</text><text start="100.98" dur="2.82">because I admit it was kinda
boring when I was doing</text><text start="103.8" dur="3.15">all of that testing but I&amp;#39;m
going to share some examples</text><text start="106.95" dur="2.37">of what I found with you and
then some of the highlights</text><text start="109.32" dur="1.983">of the testing and the way
it answers these questions</text><text start="111.303" dur="1.077">when you interact with them.</text><text start="112.38" dur="1.41">So here we go.</text><text start="113.79" dur="3.12">So with all the latest software
updates on every assistant,</text><text start="116.91" dur="2.82">all being asked the exact same questions,</text><text start="119.73" dur="3.45">asked to do the exact same
tasks with the same phrasing</text><text start="123.18" dur="1.98">and on the same WiFi connections,</text><text start="125.16" dur="2.73">most often the fastest one to answer</text><text start="127.89" dur="2.28">was Google Assistant or Siri.</text><text start="130.17" dur="4.05">But, but Siri and Bixby, in my experience,</text><text start="134.22" dur="2.58">did have the most
instances of like hanging</text><text start="136.8" dur="2.67">and pausing and not really
answering a question.</text><text start="139.47" dur="2.25">Kinda like acting like they
had a poor internet connection</text><text start="141.72" dur="0.84">even though they didn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="142.56" dur="1.41">Not sure why they did that.</text><text start="143.97" dur="1.742">A restart of the phone
helped with the Bixby one.</text><text start="145.712" dur="1.738">Siri just kinda does it randomly,</text><text start="147.45" dur="1.8">not sure why but that&amp;#39;s a real fact.</text><text start="149.25" dur="2.16">But then with straight up fact questions,</text><text start="151.41" dur="1.41">there is no runaway winner</text><text start="152.82" dur="1.32">which I think is a good thing actually.</text><text start="154.14" dur="2.46">So if you ask something
that&amp;#39;s easily Googleable</text><text start="156.6" dur="3.99">or on Wikipedia, something
like how tall is the Taj Mahal?</text><text start="160.59" dur="1.29">They can all get it.</text><text start="161.88" dur="2.19">Or if you ask, what do whales eat?</text><text start="164.07" dur="1.8">They all had some type of answer for me</text><text start="165.87" dur="1.41">that was basically the same.</text><text start="167.28" dur="3.12">Siri I found relies the
most heavily on Wikipedia</text><text start="170.4" dur="2.28">as a source for almost all of its answers.</text><text start="172.68" dur="1.98">And then when it does have
to go outside of that,</text><text start="174.66" dur="2.16">it just kinda throws up a web search link</text><text start="176.82" dur="1.83">often with Wikipedia at the top,</text><text start="178.65" dur="1.26">says, &amp;quot;Look what I Googled for you.&amp;quot;</text><text start="179.91" dur="2.55">Now Google Assistant is
the most likely to give you</text><text start="182.46" dur="2.55">a nice visual and
slightly more information</text><text start="185.01" dur="0.87">than you asked for.</text><text start="185.88" dur="2.79">Bixby is powered by Google</text><text start="188.67" dur="2.37">so I would say it&amp;#39;s
the most likely to read</text><text start="191.04" dur="2.19">what Google assistant reads word for word.</text><text start="193.23" dur="2.43">And then Alexa is the
most likely to throw in</text><text start="195.66" dur="3.36">some extra information about
your latest Amazon order</text><text start="199.02" dur="0.833">or something random.</text><text start="199.853" dur="2.257">So facts, they can all do, great.</text><text start="202.11" dur="3.78">Then there is what I&amp;#39;d call
the device control category</text><text start="205.89" dur="2.97">because these are assistants
that are on your smartphones,</text><text start="208.86" dur="2.28">they&amp;#39;re smart speakers as
well but on your phone,</text><text start="211.14" dur="1.35">you&amp;#39;d like to be able to
help you out with things</text><text start="212.49" dur="1.65">while you can&amp;#39;t use your hands.</text><text start="214.14" dur="3.36">And for this, there was a
runaway winner, actually two</text><text start="217.5" dur="3.06">and that would be Google
Assistant and Bixby.</text><text start="220.56" dur="2.94">So with the most basic, basic stuff,</text><text start="223.5" dur="1.92">they&amp;#39;re pretty much all fine.</text><text start="225.42" dur="2.43">They can all change their
screen brightness, for example,</text><text start="227.85" dur="1.08">except Alexa.</text><text start="228.93" dur="1.98">But they can also all open the camera</text><text start="230.91" dur="2.31">or pretty much any app on your
phone with a voice command.</text><text start="233.22" dur="0.833">That&amp;#39;s easy.</text><text start="234.053" dur="1.657">Setting an alarm is light work.</text><text start="235.71" dur="2.7">If you ask it actually
to open the app store,</text><text start="238.41" dur="1.56">they all open their respective app stores</text><text start="239.97" dur="3.57">and actually Bixby opens
the Samsung Galaxy Store</text><text start="243.54" dur="1.71">which is kinda cheeky.</text><text start="245.25" dur="2.1">But when it starts to get more complex,</text><text start="247.35" dur="2.28">Google and Bixby start to
walk away from the others.</text><text start="249.63" dur="2.28">So if I ask it to take a selfie,</text><text start="251.91" dur="2.31">Siri and Alexa will just open the camera</text><text start="254.22" dur="2.88">but Bixby and Google
actually open the camera,</text><text start="257.1" dur="1.83">switch to the selfie camera</text><text start="258.93" dur="3.15">and start a self-timer and
actually take a selfie.</text><text start="262.08" dur="2.94">If I wanna say play
&amp;quot;Squid game&amp;quot; on Netflix,</text><text start="265.02" dur="3.9">both Google and Bixby will
actually open the Netflix app,</text><text start="268.92" dur="2.4">find the first episode of
&amp;quot;Squid Game&amp;quot; I haven&amp;#39;t seen yet</text><text start="271.32" dur="2.58">or wherever I left off
and start playing it.</text><text start="273.9" dur="3.3">Siri just opens the app and Alexa is lost.</text><text start="277.2" dur="3.36">If I say start a voice recording
or a voice memo for Siri,</text><text start="280.56" dur="3.42">again, Google and Bixby
open the voice recording app</text><text start="283.98" dur="2.4">and actually start that recording.</text><text start="286.38" dur="2.13">Siri again just opens the app.</text><text start="288.51" dur="2.1">And again, Alexa is lost.</text><text start="290.61" dur="2.49">These voice commands when they
work are legitimately faster</text><text start="293.1" dur="1.65">than I would&amp;#39;ve been able to do it by hand</text><text start="294.75" dur="0.833">for the most part.</text><text start="295.583" dur="1.867">And there&amp;#39;s a bunch of
other device specific stuff</text><text start="297.45" dur="2.82">that Samsung has programmed
into Bixby where it can reach</text><text start="300.27" dur="3.42">into apps and perform
specific commands within them.</text><text start="303.69" dur="2.19">So if there are apps who use a lot,</text><text start="305.88" dur="1.71">this can potentially
save you a lot of time.</text><text start="307.59" dur="1.86">Bixby was also great at
this last time I did it</text><text start="309.45" dur="4.11">and also Alexa is unsurprisingly
the worst at device control</text><text start="313.56" dur="2.79">because they aren&amp;#39;t
making their own phone.</text><text start="316.35" dur="1.23">These aren&amp;#39;t Amazon phones.</text><text start="317.58" dur="2.28">So the vertical
integration&amp;#39;s great with Siri</text><text start="319.86" dur="3.03">and Google Assistant and
Bixby, not with Alexa,</text><text start="322.89" dur="1.17">not a shocker there.</text><text start="324.06" dur="2.58">What might be a little
bit of a surprise though</text><text start="326.64" dur="1.77">is conversationalism.</text><text start="328.41" dur="2.403">Who is the coach of the Phoenix Sons?</text><text start="332.416" dur="1.849">Huh, how tall is he?</text><text start="334.265" dur="3.083">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="338.76" dur="2.006">Did he play in the NBA?</text><text start="340.766" dur="3.083">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="344.79" dur="1.64">What team did he play for?</text><text start="346.43" dur="1.93">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="348.36" dur="1.35">So you can see, Siri tapped out</text><text start="349.71" dur="2.16">after about four questions
in a row about the same thing</text><text start="351.87" dur="2.4">but Google Assistant
is incredible at this.</text><text start="354.27" dur="3">It&amp;#39;s really, really good
at remembering the context</text><text start="357.27" dur="1.8">and the subject of a natural conversation</text><text start="359.07" dur="2.94">and carrying that on through
a bunch of questions in a row.</text><text start="362.01" dur="1.753">Where is the Taj Mahal?</text><text start="363.763" dur="3.287">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="367.05" dur="2.01">Okay, how tall is it?</text><text start="369.06" dur="3.083">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="373.74" dur="2.151">How many meters is that?</text><text start="375.891" dur="3.083">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="379.89" dur="1.506">What is it made of?</text><text start="381.396" dur="3.083">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="385.71" dur="2.52">See, again, Google remembers
what we&amp;#39;re talking about.</text><text start="388.23" dur="1.917">When is the Weeknd&amp;#39;s birthday?</text><text start="390.147" dur="3.083">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="395.55" dur="1.42">What&amp;#39;s their latest album?</text><text start="396.97" dur="3.083">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="402.51" dur="1.315">What&amp;#39;s his real name?</text><text start="403.825" dur="2.855">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="406.68" dur="2.67">So basically, if you&amp;#39;re asking
a bunch of questions in a row</text><text start="409.35" dur="2.46">or if you have one subject that you want</text><text start="411.81" dur="2.55">to basically research
through the voice assistant</text><text start="414.36" dur="1.74">or get a bunch of answers on,</text><text start="416.1" dur="2.61">your best bet is definitely
Google Assistant.</text><text start="418.71" dur="1.59">And then one more interesting
thing from the crew</text><text start="420.3" dur="2.16">is that I ask just as
far as getting pictures.</text><text start="422.46" dur="1.53">When you ask for pictures of something</text><text start="423.99" dur="2.64">like dogs for example,
they can all search the web</text><text start="426.63" dur="1.14">except Bixby didn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="427.77" dur="2.97">And Alexa, which is looking
for an Amazon Photos app</text><text start="430.74" dur="1.23">for some reason.</text><text start="431.97" dur="3.9">But when you say, show
me my pictures of dogs,</text><text start="435.87" dur="3.9">Google actually opens and
searches in my own Photos album</text><text start="439.77" dur="1.56">for my own pictures of dogs.</text><text start="441.33" dur="1.59">So I did a bunch of
other testing like this</text><text start="442.92" dur="1.35">with a bunch of other different questions,</text><text start="444.27" dur="1.29">different styles of questions,</text><text start="445.56" dur="2.13">follow up questions and things like that</text><text start="447.69" dur="2.82">and I&amp;#39;ve come to a
pretty solid conclusion.</text><text start="450.51" dur="2.557">So if you&amp;#39;re wondering
which one is the best;</text><text start="453.067" dur="1.23">&amp;quot;Marques, you did all these tests,</text><text start="454.297" dur="2.363">&amp;quot;which one came out as number one?&amp;quot;</text><text start="456.66" dur="2.4">Only one thing became exceptionally clear</text><text start="459.06" dur="3.69">through all this testing
which is that Alexa</text><text start="462.75" dur="3.96">is clearly the worst, is
clearly far behind the others</text><text start="466.71" dur="2.028">as a smart assistant on a phone.</text><text start="468.738" dur="3.822">I mean, unless maybe you&amp;#39;re already deep</text><text start="472.56" dur="2.73">in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem</text><text start="475.29" dur="2.13">with everything working
perfectly in your smart home.</text><text start="477.42" dur="3.39">Matter of fact, this really
is an ecosystem question</text><text start="480.81" dur="2.88">almost as much as it is a skills question</text><text start="483.69" dur="0.833">for the assistants.</text><text start="484.523" dur="2.557">Because if you are super all in</text><text start="487.08" dur="2.04">on one of these smart home ecosystems,</text><text start="489.12" dur="2.1">that actually could answer
the question for you.</text><text start="491.22" dur="1.77">Of course, if you&amp;#39;re all in with HomeKit,</text><text start="492.99" dur="2.94">then Siri and then iPhone
is your only option</text><text start="495.93" dur="2.64">to view your cameras and
see your doorbell ringing</text><text start="498.57" dur="1.62">and turn on your lights
and all that stuff.</text><text start="500.19" dur="2.67">But if you are doing the
same with Google Home</text><text start="502.86" dur="1.77">and Google Assistant, then you&amp;#39;re there.</text><text start="504.63" dur="4.05">Now the next Gen Matter
standard may change all of this.</text><text start="508.68" dur="2.79">It may actually make
this section irrelevant,</text><text start="511.47" dur="1.89">maybe leave the thumbs up
on this video or comment</text><text start="513.36" dur="2.28">if you&amp;#39;re interested in a
video about that specifically.</text><text start="515.64" dur="4.02">But for now, with these different
silos of home ecosystems,</text><text start="519.66" dur="0.833">that&amp;#39;s pretty important.</text><text start="520.493" dur="2.887">But I&amp;#39;ll still say from
my most common experiences</text><text start="523.38" dur="2.85">and queries and the things
that are most useful;</text><text start="526.23" dur="3.33">across every single phone,
iPhones or Android phones,</text><text start="529.56" dur="3.87">the most useful assistant
is still Google Assistant.</text><text start="533.43" dur="2.49">And that&amp;#39;s multiplied if
you also happen to have</text><text start="535.92" dur="3.45">a pixel phone because then
you also get call screening</text><text start="539.37" dur="2.7">and Hold for Me and all
those extra pixel features.</text><text start="542.07" dur="3.06">But in general, Google Assistant
is most likely to be fast.</text><text start="545.13" dur="2.88">It&amp;#39;s most likely to give a
good well sourced answer.</text><text start="548.01" dur="2.04">It&amp;#39;s most likely to be conversational</text><text start="550.05" dur="1.95">and remember context longer.</text><text start="552" dur="1.74">And it has a bunch of third party plugs,</text><text start="553.74" dur="1.5">tons of app support.</text><text start="555.24" dur="2.73">And I also happen to
have built my smart home</text><text start="557.97" dur="2.13">in the Google Home world so it&amp;#39;s great.</text><text start="560.1" dur="4.56">Now for the second best, I&amp;#39;m
very tempted to say Bixby.</text><text start="564.66" dur="2.19">Of course though, this is only relevant</text><text start="566.85" dur="2.28">if you have a Samsung phone.</text><text start="569.13" dur="3.03">And also, it is basically
saying all the same</text><text start="572.16" dur="3.72">first query responses
that Google assistant was</text><text start="575.88" dur="3.54">minus the ability to
talk to a smart speaker</text><text start="579.42" dur="4.11">since Samsung would probably
like us to forget about that.</text><text start="583.53" dur="3.75">But I am gonna have to put
Siri in second place here.</text><text start="587.28" dur="1.38">It&amp;#39;s fine, it&amp;#39;s okay</text><text start="588.66" dur="2.04">it&amp;#39;s all right, it&amp;#39;s fine, it&amp;#39;s not great</text><text start="590.7" dur="2.88">but it is the most well
plugged into Apple&amp;#39;s ecosystem.</text><text start="593.58" dur="1.53">So of course, if you&amp;#39;re
doing HomeKit stuff,</text><text start="595.11" dur="1.71">it&amp;#39;s gonna work well there.</text><text start="596.82" dur="3.54">It does support a smart speaker
which can do multiple timers</text><text start="600.36" dur="2.37">if you&amp;#39;re not doing stuff
all the time on your phone.</text><text start="602.73" dur="1.71">And it does support routines</text><text start="604.44" dur="2.79">which is like stacking a
bunch of different commands</text><text start="607.23" dur="2.67">into one action if you&amp;#39;re
willing to dig through</text><text start="609.9" dur="3.09">the very convoluted Siri
shortcuts interface.</text><text start="612.99" dur="5">So that puts Bixby in third
place and Alexa is just bad,</text><text start="618.21" dur="1.68">it&amp;#39;s just bad on a phone.</text><text start="619.89" dur="2.13">Like there was a phone a couple years ago,</text><text start="622.02" dur="2.85">an HTC phone where it was built in</text><text start="624.87" dur="2.91">so there was Google Assistant
and Alexa side by side</text><text start="627.78" dur="2.49">on the same phone and it
worked kinda well back then</text><text start="630.27" dur="2.46">but that was years ago and
Alexa is just dead last</text><text start="632.73" dur="1.83">on a phone right now and Amazon knows it.</text><text start="634.56" dur="2.22">Amazon is falling behind with Alexa</text><text start="636.78" dur="2.46">and if you&amp;#39;re just
starting to use assistants</text><text start="639.24" dur="2.25">or put together a smart
home or this type of stuff,</text><text start="641.49" dur="3.03">I would say avoid things that
