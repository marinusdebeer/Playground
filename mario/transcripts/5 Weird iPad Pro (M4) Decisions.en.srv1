using the new M4 iPad Pro</text><text start="5.73" dur="1.47">for like two weeks now.</text><text start="7.2" dur="1.38">I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot
of the same stuff I did</text><text start="8.58" dur="3.15">with my M1 iPad Pro from three years ago:</text><text start="11.73" dur="2.28">watching YouTube videos,
browsing the internet,</text><text start="14.01" dur="2.07">answering emails, listening to music.</text><text start="16.08" dur="4.44">And spoiler alert, it&amp;#39;s almost
exactly the same experience.</text><text start="20.52" dur="2.76">The M1 iPad Pro was
already super overpowered</text><text start="23.28" dur="3.3">and very smooth and snappy
and had great battery life.</text><text start="26.58" dur="4.08">And this one now, even more
so, of all of the same stuff.</text><text start="30.66" dur="1.62">Not a very helpful review, I know,</text><text start="32.28" dur="0.99">but I&amp;#39;ve also been thinking</text><text start="33.27" dur="1.59">about some of the really
interesting decisions</text><text start="34.86" dur="1.95">that Apple made with this iPad.</text><text start="36.81" dur="1.83">Specifically, some stuff that wasn&amp;#39;t like</text><text start="38.64" dur="1.35">even really in the rumor mills,</text><text start="39.99" dur="2.55">it kind of just came up, didn&amp;#39;t
even show up in the keynote,</text><text start="42.54" dur="3.18">but is unusual and different.</text><text start="45.72" dur="2.82">So these are five of the
most interesting choices</text><text start="48.54" dur="1.95">that Apple made with the iPad Pro.</text><text start="50.49" dur="3">So first of all, the
new iPad Pro is thinner.</text><text start="53.49" dur="0.93">We all knew that.</text><text start="54.42" dur="1.38">It was already an interesting decision</text><text start="55.8" dur="2.67">because I kind of felt
like we were done with that</text><text start="58.47" dur="0.99">a few iterations ago.</text><text start="59.46" dur="2.13">Like nobody was asking for thinner iPads,</text><text start="61.59" dur="1.89">But maybe they saw all the gushing</text><text start="63.48" dur="2.43">over Samsung&amp;#39;s Galaxy Tab Ultra.</text><text start="65.91" dur="0.833">Guilty.</text><text start="66.743" dur="2.257">That thing is also
ridiculously, impossibly thin.</text><text start="69" dur="2.73">So iPad goes from 6.4 mm,</text><text start="71.73" dur="2.22">which was slightly thicker
than Samsung&amp;#39;s flagship,</text><text start="73.95" dur="2.25">to now 5.1 mm,</text><text start="76.2" dur="3.36">which just barely beats Samsung&amp;#39;s number.</text><text start="79.56" dur="0.833">Now, you know, I&amp;#39;m not trying</text><text start="80.393" dur="2.887">to start any beef that
doesn&amp;#39;t already exist.</text><text start="83.28" dur="1.837">You know, I&amp;#39;m sure if you
ask Apple, they&amp;#39;ll just say,</text><text start="85.117" dur="3.143">&amp;quot;Look, it&amp;#39;s the thinnest
Apple product ever,&amp;quot;</text><text start="88.26" dur="1.77">which is already nuts.</text><text start="90.03" dur="1.23">It&amp;#39;s crazy thin.</text><text start="91.26" dur="1.32">But I think it really feels like Apple</text><text start="92.58" dur="2.82">is just looking for something
to make this different,</text><text start="95.4" dur="1.14">to make it feel different</text><text start="96.54" dur="2.67">from the last couple
of generations of iPad.</text><text start="99.21" dur="2.97">And now there&amp;#39;s rumors that
they may also be doing this</text><text start="102.18" dur="4.44">to next year&amp;#39;s iPhone,
just going with thinness.</text><text start="106.62" dur="3.03">Honestly, it is noticeably
thinner and lighter to me,</text><text start="109.65" dur="2.07">someone who&amp;#39;s held the
previous one quite a bit.</text><text start="111.72" dur="2.22">Definitely less of a difference
when you have a case on it,</text><text start="113.94" dur="1.68">but this is also gonna naturally mean</text><text start="115.62" dur="2.31">there&amp;#39;s less room inside the iPad.</text><text start="117.93" dur="4.32">But weirdly, somehow, the 11&amp;quot; iPad Pro M4</text><text start="122.25" dur="4.62">has a larger battery than the
last-generation 11&amp;quot; iPad Pro,</text><text start="126.87" dur="1.83">and this new, bigger 13&amp;quot; has like</text><text start="128.7" dur="1.86">a tiny bit slightly smaller battery,</text><text start="130.56" dur="2.52">almost the same size battery as last year.</text><text start="133.08" dur="3.51">And so what you end up with
is a really good battery life,</text><text start="136.59" dur="2.01">again, awesome standby time.</text><text start="138.6" dur="2.76">Really good battery when
you&amp;#39;re actually using it.</text><text start="141.36" dur="3.09">But what strikes me is
Apple could have made,</text><text start="144.45" dur="2.37">if they made this the same
thickness as last year,</text><text start="146.82" dur="3.96">they could have made an iPad
with an enormous battery life.</text><text start="150.78" dur="1.92">With the efficiency of the M4 chip,</text><text start="152.7" dur="2.793">it could have had some
insane long battery,</text><text start="156.45" dur="2.73">or they could make
something strikingly thin</text><text start="159.18" dur="3.63">and have the same rock-solid
battery life as always.</text><text start="162.81" dur="2.37">But I would&amp;#39;ve loved to
have seen option one.</text><text start="165.18" dur="2.73">But anyway, there&amp;#39;s also
a few other things missing</text><text start="167.91" dur="1.08">from this tablet as well.</text><text start="168.99" dur="1.8">So they avoided saying
it during the keynote,</text><text start="170.79" dur="3">but they got rid of the ultra-wide camera.</text><text start="173.79" dur="1.62">Not a huge deal at all, obviously.</text><text start="175.41" dur="2.07">They kind of have a huge cutout</text><text start="177.48" dur="2.04">for the LiDAR on the camera square.</text><text start="179.52" dur="1.11">It still kind of looks like</text><text start="180.63" dur="1.68">it&amp;#39;s maybe a dual or triple camera setup,</text><text start="182.31" dur="3">but nope, single camera,
LiDAR, and a flash.</text><text start="185.31" dur="2.19">And I was also curious if magnet paper</text><text start="187.5" dur="3.36">could reveal anything new
about the insides of this iPad.</text><text start="190.86" dur="3.12">This was before JerryRigEverything,
like tore his apart.</text><text start="193.98" dur="1.26">But I know instinctively</text><text start="195.24" dur="1.953">if you make something thinner and smaller,</text><text start="197.193" dur="2.787">then the speakers have to suffer, right?</text><text start="199.98" dur="0.833">They would be smaller.</text><text start="200.813" dur="1.207">And magnet paper, fun fact,</text><text start="202.02" dur="2.37">is a great way not only to see the magnets</text><text start="204.39" dur="2.67">inside of a device, of
which there are many here,</text><text start="207.06" dur="2.16">but it also shows the
iPad Pro has these new,</text><text start="209.22" dur="2.64">much more circular quad speaker drivers</text><text start="211.86" dur="3.03">as opposed to the more
rectangular-looking ones from before.</text><text start="214.89" dur="1.2">I&amp;#39;ve listened to them back to back,</text><text start="216.09" dur="1.56">this one versus the last generation.</text><text start="217.65" dur="4.08">And this one is a little bit less bassy,</text><text start="221.73" dur="3.15">still loud, still some of the
best speakers in any tablet</text><text start="224.88" dur="2.46">and very usable, but physics.</text><text start="227.34" dur="1.77">So less room inside,</text><text start="229.11" dur="1.92">a little bit less bassy
with these new speakers.</text><text start="231.03" dur="2.73">Now, packaging wise,
not a lot has changed.</text><text start="233.76" dur="2.34">I mean, an iPad box is still an iPad box,</text><text start="236.1" dur="3.33">but two things: one, no stickers anymore.</text><text start="239.43" dur="2.07">So, sorry Apple fan boys,</text><text start="241.5" dur="2.88">if were are hoping to keep collecting.</text><text start="244.38" dur="2.7">Environmental things, no more plastic.</text><text start="247.08" dur="2.13">They&amp;#39;re trying not to ship so much stuff.</text><text start="249.21" dur="2.46">But the thing is, okay,
they are still shipping</text><text start="251.67" dur="1.47">these two things with every iPad.</text><text start="253.14" dur="2.88">If you get a Space Grey
iPad, you get a black cable,</text><text start="256.02" dur="1.41">so the USB-C cable,</text><text start="257.43" dur="2.49">but you also still get
a brick with every iPad.</text><text start="259.92" dur="5">Fine, but it&amp;#39;s this white
20-watt charging brick,</text><text start="265.56" dur="1.95">which, okay, I know they stopped shipping</text><text start="267.51" dur="0.93">the brick with the iPhone</text><text start="268.44" dur="1.71">and they could use the same logic</text><text start="270.15" dur="1.68">and stop shipping a brick with the iPad,</text><text start="271.83" dur="1.26">but they&amp;#39;re still gonna ship you a brick.</text><text start="273.09" dur="0.93">And if you do</text><text start="274.02" dur="5">with this $1,500, $2,000, $2,500 iPad,</text><text start="279.57" dur="1.74">could it at least be a good brick?</text><text start="281.31" dur="1.41">Could you at least give us</text><text start="282.72" dur="1.98">the fastest charging the iPad can support</text><text start="284.7" dur="3.33">and maybe even match the
color of the cable maybe.</text><text start="288.03" dur="3.06">But anyway, maybe that&amp;#39;s
nitpicking. Hopefully not though.</text><text start="291.09" dur="3.18">But let&amp;#39;s talk about this computer thing.</text><text start="294.27" dur="3.03">So the knock on the iPad
Pro for years now has been</text><text start="297.3" dur="2.97">that it&amp;#39;s a ridiculously overpowered,</text><text start="300.27" dur="2.28">amazing piece of hardware,
but it&amp;#39;s still an iPad.</text><text start="302.55" dur="2.79">Like it still does basically
the same set of things</text><text start="305.34" dur="1.59">that an iPad Air does.</text><text start="306.93" dur="1.17">There&amp;#39;s a couple little things</text><text start="308.1" dur="1.65">like Pencil hover and little stuff.</text><text start="309.75" dur="1.11">It&amp;#39;s basically the same.</text><text start="310.86" dur="1.11">So they&amp;#39;re not going</text><text start="311.97" dur="3.24">to let this turn into
a full-fledged computer</text><text start="315.21" dur="2.67">because Apple has Macs to protect.</text><text start="317.88" dur="2.97">So it&amp;#39;s kind of stuck
as an overpowered iPad.</text><text start="320.85" dur="1.26">And with this generation,</text><text start="322.11" dur="2.22">well, yeah, it&amp;#39;s still kind of true.</text><text start="324.33" dur="2.22">Again, this is the first time Apple</text><text start="326.55" dur="3.18">is unveiling the
newest-generation M4 chip,</text><text start="329.73" dur="1.74">and it&amp;#39;s only in this iPad Pro for now,</text><text start="331.47" dur="2.19">but it&amp;#39;s even more powerful at its peak.</text><text start="333.66" dur="2.04">It benchmarks extremely well.</text><text start="335.7" dur="2.37">It&amp;#39;s a second-generation
3-nanometer process.</text><text start="338.07" dur="3.48">It has a larger and more
powerful neural engine as well.</text><text start="341.55" dur="1.71">I mean this chip is great,
but as far as things</text><text start="343.26" dur="1.62">that actually take advantage of that,</text><text start="344.88" dur="3.15">the list is very, very short.</text><text start="348.03" dur="2.37">And some of the stuff is even
like coming later this year,</text><text start="350.4" dur="2.55">like the new Final Cut app
is just around the corner.</text><text start="352.95" dur="3.6">So if you just do regular iPad stuff:</text><text start="356.55" dur="2.88">watching Netflix, web
browsing, all the classics,</text><text start="359.43" dur="1.74">like this is gonna feel exactly the same,</text><text start="361.17" dur="3.81">not just as the last M1 iPad
Pro, but as an M1 iPad Air.</text><text start="364.98" dur="1.65">You know, if you get this M4 version here</text><text start="366.63" dur="3.78">you can play those, one
of the like three games</text><text start="370.41" dur="2.28">that support the new
hardware-accelerated ray tracing</text><text start="372.69" dur="1.77">on this iPad.</text><text start="374.46" dur="2.52">You can use the new Stem Splitter feature</text><text start="376.98" dur="1.74">in the new Logic Pro 2 app for iPad</text><text start="378.72" dur="3">that actually looks incredible
if you use Logic on the iPad.</text><text start="381.72" dur="3.18">But the most interesting
new thing to me about M4</text><text start="384.9" dur="2.13">is something that they
didn&amp;#39;t really talk about.</text><text start="387.03" dur="1.02">They kind of glossed over it.</text><text start="388.05" dur="1.95">They didn&amp;#39;t really dive
into it in the keynote</text><text start="390" dur="2.7">and they don&amp;#39;t show it on
their website very clearly.</text><text start="392.7" dur="3.99">But okay, in the past when
you were buying an iPad,</text><text start="396.69" dur="3.96">all you really pay more
for in a single iPad lineup</text><text start="400.65" dur="1.38">is storage, right?</text><text start="402.03" dur="3.03">That&amp;#39;s just, you start
with, it&amp;#39;ll be 128 gigs,</text><text start="405.06" dur="2.49">kind of a joke, but
then you go up in price</text><text start="407.55" dur="2.4">and you just pay for more storage</text><text start="409.95" dur="1.08">and you can get different colors.</text><text start="411.03" dur="1.71">And then a few years ago, very sneakily,</text><text start="412.74" dur="3">we started realizing, okay,
you actually also get more RAM</text><text start="415.74" dur="1.47">in the highest-end models.</text><text start="417.21" dur="2.25">So if you buy more storage,
you&amp;#39;ll also get more RAM.</text><text start="419.46" dur="2.01">So 8 gigs of RAM on the base ones</text><text start="421.47" dur="4.68">and 16 gigs of RAM on the one
and two-terabyte iPad pros.</text><text start="426.15" dur="1.35">But now on this latest one,</text><text start="427.5" dur="1.38">the stratification goes even further.</text><text start="428.88" dur="2.04">Now it&amp;#39;s also CPU cores.</text><text start="430.92" dur="1.41">So first of all, the base iPad Pro</text><text start="432.33" dur="2.7">is 256 gigs now, thankfully.</text><text start="435.03" dur="2.01">And you go from an eight-core CPU</text><text start="437.04" dur="2.73">to a nine-core CPU with the M4,</text><text start="439.77" dur="2.16">but that&amp;#39;s just with
the base two versions.</text><text start="441.93" dur="2.94">The top two versions get
another performance core.</text><text start="444.87" dur="3.33">So those are 10-core CPUs instead of 9.</text><text start="448.2" dur="3.24">And then there&amp;#39;s also the
nano-texture display option.</text><text start="451.44" dur="1.35">And this is that matte finish one</text><text start="452.79" dur="2.37">that I briefly got hands-on
time with at the event.</text><text start="455.16" dur="1.41">I haven&amp;#39;t gotten to see it since,</text><text start="456.57" dur="1.98">but it does look pretty impressive</text><text start="458.55" dur="2.88">even though I do have my
durability concerns with it.</text><text start="461.43" dur="2.52">But that anti-reflective finish
is only available, again,</text><text start="463.95" dur="3.27">on the top two options, the
one and two-terabyte iPad Pros,</text><text start="467.22" dur="1.35">the expensive ones.</text><text start="468.57" dur="3.21">So now if you&amp;#39;re buying a
more expensive iPad Pro,</text><text start="471.78" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;re getting different
amounts of RAM, different CPU,</text><text start="476.52" dur="4.653">different storage options and
different display options.</text><text start="482.19" dur="1.77">Very computer-like if you ask me.</text><text start="483.96" dur="2.49">Now, the Tandem OLED display, to me,</text><text start="486.45" dur="1.26">is the most interesting thing</text><text start="487.71" dur="2.13">about this new iPad Pro under the hood.</text><text start="489.84" dur="1.89">But in practice, it&amp;#39;s actually honestly</text><text start="491.73" dur="2.88">just a bit of a brighter,
more-contrasty version</text><text start="494.61" dur="2.28">of the same thing we&amp;#39;ve
been looking at for years.</text><text start="496.89" dur="0.99">A perfect example of</text><text start="497.88" dur="2.25">the iPad&amp;#39;s hardware outpacing the software</text><text start="500.13" dur="2.94">is, obviously, a new OLED
display would be great</text><text start="503.07" dur="1.5">if you had like an all-black background</text><text start="504.57" dur="1.26">and maybe showed just the time,</text><text start="505.83" dur="4.56">maybe fed an always-on display,
it could look super cool,</text><text start="510.39" dur="2.82">but the iPad doesn&amp;#39;t have
an always-on display.</text><text start="513.21" dur="1.53">I don&amp;#39;t wanna bet money,</text><text start="514.74" dur="3.18">but I wouldn&amp;#39;t be shocked if
the next version of iPadOS</text><text start="517.92" dur="3.57">did support an always-on
display with just the Pros</text><text start="521.49" dur="2.49">&amp;#39;cause they have the
OLEDs now, but it doesn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="523.98" dur="2.97">We gotta wait till WWDC and
then maybe we&amp;#39;ll see it there.</text><text start="526.95" dur="2.01">But I mean, aside from that,
it still has less blooming</text><text start="528.96" dur="2.52">for just like the perfect HDR content</text><text start="531.48" dur="1.53">with pitch-black blacks.</text><text start="533.01" dur="0.87">I love to see that.</text><text start="533.88" dur="2.01">If you&amp;#39;re just watching
regular SDR content though,</text><text start="535.89" dur="2.13">or just doing any number of regular tasks,</text><text start="538.02" dur="3.33">watching Netflix, browsing
emails, or web stuff,</text><text start="541.35" dur="1.92">I mean, you won&amp;#39;t notice
much of a difference</text><text start="543.27" dur="2.07">unless you&amp;#39;re in direct
sun, max brightness.</text><text start="545.34" dur="2.22">That&amp;#39;s a testament to how
good iPad Pro displays</text><text start="547.56" dur="2.01">have been for years in the past though.</text><text start="549.57" dur="1.26">Now for your artists out there,</text><text start="550.83" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;ve also got this sweet new Pencil.</text><text start="554.22" dur="2.52">No, the back still does
not act as an eraser,</text><text start="556.74" dur="1.53">as much as I wish they would do that.</text><text start="558.27" dur="2.64">But the rest of this
thing is better than ever.</text><text start="560.91" dur="1.53">It supports Find My now,</text><text start="562.44" dur="2.22">it has a new squeeze sensor inside</text><text start="564.66" dur="1.41">for selecting different tools.</text><text start="566.07" dur="2.28">Super intuitive. I started
using it immediately.</text><text start="568.35" dur="1.83">It also has a new haptic motor inside,</text><text start="570.18" dur="2.04">so you can feel this little
click as you squeeze,</text><text start="572.22" dur="1.71">which is a nice little confirmation.</text><text start="573.93" dur="1.59">Kind of surprised they
didn&amp;#39;t add this earlier.</text><text start="575.52" dur="2.91">And then it supports barrel
rotation for a few tools</text><text start="578.43" dur="3.39">that specifically change
when you rotate the point.</text><text start="581.82" dur="2.49">And look, it even has this fake shadow.</text><text start="584.31" dur="3.3">So this is not a real
shadow of the Apple Pencil.</text><text start="587.61" dur="0.99">This is a fake,</text><text start="588.6" dur="3.24">totally unnecessary
computer-generated shadow</text><text start="591.84" dur="1.92">that&amp;#39;s shown on the iPad&amp;#39;s display,</text><text start="593.76" dur="4.2">and it actually matches the
type of tool you&amp;#39;re using</text><text start="597.96" dur="2.31">in real time, with rotation.</text><text start="600.27" dur="1.5">That&amp;#39;s just ridiculous.</text><text start="601.77" dur="2.88">And instead of just calling
it the updated Apple Pencil,</text><text start="604.65" dur="1.86">they&amp;#39;re continuing to
sell the old Apple Pencil</text><text start="606.51" dur="0.833">at the same price</text><text start="607.343" dur="3.49">and they&amp;#39;re calling this
one the new Pencil Pro.</text><text start="611.91" dur="1.47">And look, I am not an artist.</text><text start="613.38" dur="1.62">I am squarely outside of</text><text start="615" dur="1.95">the target demographic for this thing,</text><text start="616.95" dur="2.61">but what I do know is if this</text><text start="619.56" dur="2.58">and its features are tempting to you,</text><text start="622.14" dur="4.23">then you will need to buy a whole new iPad</text><text start="626.37" dur="1.438">to take advantage of it.</text><text start="627.808" dur="2.252">(dramatic suspicious music)</text><text start="630.06" dur="3.54">And that was on purpose.</text><text start="633.6" dur="1.8">See, they moved the camera</text><text start="635.4" dur="2.58">to the landscape side of the
iPad now, which is great.</text><text start="637.98" dur="1.95">That&amp;#39;s where we wanted
it to be the whole time.</text><text start="639.93" dur="2.64">That&amp;#39;s where the Face ID
array is now. It&amp;#39;s awesome.</text><text start="642.57" dur="1.95">It&amp;#39;s an ultra-wide camera
for FaceTime and all that,</text><text start="644.52" dur="1.77">but that&amp;#39;s also where the Pencil</text><text start="646.29" dur="2.07">has always magnetized and charged.</text><text start="648.36" dur="4.23">So they actually had to
rearrange the components inside</text><text start="652.59" dur="1.62">to be slightly different</text><text start="654.21" dur="2.82">to work with both now in the same place.</text><text start="657.03" dur="3.243">So it still snaps on the top like that.</text><text start="661.23" dur="2.37">But did they have to do that?</text><text start="663.6" dur="3.87">Couldn&amp;#39;t they have put the
Pencil on the top of the iPad</text><text start="667.47" dur="3.36">or even maybe offset it so
that the Pencil&amp;#39;s on one side</text><text start="670.83" dur="1.75">and the camera&amp;#39;s on the other side,</text><text start="673.8" dur="1.95">but no, they&amp;#39;ve got it just</text><text start="675.75" dur="1.32">in the middle where it always is.</text><text start="677.07" dur="1.59">And I put some magnet paper up to the back</text><text start="678.66" dur="2.1">so I can see that they did in fact</text><text start="680.76" dur="2.19">change the magnet layout inside.</text><text start="682.95" dur="2.04">Like I tried pairing
the new Apple Pencil Pro</text><text start="684.99" dur="3.78">to my old iPad Pro and it
kind of stuck on, sort of,</text><text start="688.77" dur="1.59">but didn&amp;#39;t pair or do anything.</text><text start="690.36" dur="1.14">All right, convenient.</text><text start="691.5" dur="1.59">Look, I&amp;#39;m still personally not going</text><text start="693.09" dur="3.39">to be buying one of these new M4 iPad Pros</text><text start="696.48" dur="1.95">because of what I do on the iPad Pro</text><text start="698.43" dur="4.47">and I already have a
relatively new M1 iPad,</text><text start="702.9" dur="0.833">so I don&amp;#39;t need one.</text><text start="703.733" dur="4.507">But if you don&amp;#39;t have a
relatively recent iPad,</text><text start="708.24" dur="2.16">then yeah, this thing is great.</text><text start="710.4" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s better than ever.</text><text start="711.233" dur="1.237">But I think we&amp;#39;re all on the same page</text><text start="712.47" dur="3.09">that we&amp;#39;re waiting WWDC later this year</text><text start="715.56" dur="3.21">to see what&amp;#39;s new with the
latest version of iPadOS</text><text start="718.77" dur="1.95">to see if there&amp;#39;s anything
actually interesting</text><text start="720.72" dur="1.14">that this will be capable of</text><text start="721.86" dur="1.71">that we don&amp;#39;t already know about.</text><text start="723.57" dur="2.31">Because other than that,
it&amp;#39;s kind of the same story</text><text start="725.88" dur="2.79">as the last few generations
of the iPad Pro.</text><text start="728.67" dur="1.86">Speaking of things that are thin, though,</text><text start="730.53" dur="1.14">dbrand iPad skins.</text><text start="731.67" dur="4.17">Fun fact, you&amp;#39;d have to stack
up 22 of dbrand&amp;#39;s iPad skins</text><text start="735.84" dur="2.34">to make it the same
thickness as the iPad itself.</text><text start="738.18" dur="2.85">Trust me, I&amp;#39;ve tried. It&amp;#39;s exactly 22.</text><text start="741.03" dur="1.08">Anyway, dbrand has been making</text><text start="742.11" dur="2.22">the best leather skins in
the business for a while now,</text><text start="744.33" dur="1.44">which is great because Apple actually</text><text start="745.77" dur="2.4">isn&amp;#39;t really making
anything leather anymore.</text><text start="748.17" dur="3.45">And this is good quality soft leather,</text><text start="751.62" dur="3.63">like it&amp;#39;s not some sanded-down
and stamped fake texture.</text><text start="755.25" dur="2.67">It&amp;#39;s actually all-natural,
full-grain leather.</text><text start="757.92" dur="1.89">It&amp;#39;s plush and it&amp;#39;ll actually develop</text><text start="759.81" dur="1.2">a nice patina over time</text><text start="761.01" dur="2.67">since you can literally
own these iPads for years.</text><text start="763.68" dur="2.34">So if you wanna check out
