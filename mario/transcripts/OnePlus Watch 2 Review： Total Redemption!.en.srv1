<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.077" dur="2.923">(upbeat music)</text><text start="3" dur="1.41">- So this smartwatch</text><text start="4.41" dur="3">has one really interesting
trick up its sleeve</text><text start="7.41" dur="3.06">that I haven&amp;#39;t seen in any
other, and that, honestly,</text><text start="10.47" dur="1.44">I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re ever gonna see again.</text><text start="11.91" dur="1.65">So at this point we know</text><text start="13.56" dur="2.22">what a smartwatch is already, right?</text><text start="15.78" dur="2.52">This is a stable, mature category.</text><text start="18.3" dur="1.83">They deliver mostly across the board</text><text start="20.13" dur="1.59">on all the same functions.</text><text start="21.72" dur="2.79">And aside from the one crazy trick,</text><text start="24.51" dur="1.62">this one is no exception.</text><text start="26.13" dur="1.83">This is the OnePlus Watch 2,</text><text start="27.96" dur="1.95">three years after the
original OnePlus Watch</text><text start="29.91" dur="1.32">and it costs 300 bucks.</text><text start="31.23" dur="1.59">So for the $300 you&amp;#39;re spending,</text><text start="32.82" dur="2.55">you&amp;#39;re getting a pretty
nice circular watch design.</text><text start="35.37" dur="3.39">It comes in this black or
silver stainless steel body</text><text start="38.76" dur="1.41">and a sapphire cover glass</text><text start="40.17" dur="3.66">over a 1.4 inch, 60 hertz AMOLED display.</text><text start="43.83" dur="1.83">Design-wise, you could argue</text><text start="45.66" dur="2.28">it takes cues from maybe the OnePlus 11</text><text start="47.94" dur="1.83">or the OnePlus 12 with
the way the camera bump</text><text start="49.77" dur="1.89">is melted into the side rail of the phone.</text><text start="51.66" dur="1.11">They&amp;#39;ve done a similar thing here</text><text start="52.77" dur="1.89">with the buttons on the side of the watch.</text><text start="54.66" dur="2.1">So there&amp;#39;s a circular button at the top</text><text start="56.76" dur="2.46">and this rectangular button at the bottom.</text><text start="59.22" dur="1.56">And I kind of like it. It&amp;#39;s a nice shape.</text><text start="60.78" dur="2.7">It&amp;#39;s got this little
subtle, classy variation</text><text start="63.48" dur="1.74">of just the pure circle.</text><text start="65.22" dur="1.74">And then the back looks
pretty standard too.</text><text start="66.96" dur="2.67">You got the four pins at the
top, those are for charging.</text><text start="69.63" dur="1.35">And it has all the sensors you&amp;#39;d expect</text><text start="70.98" dur="1.68">for a smartwatch in the middle,</text><text start="72.66" dur="1.47">optical heart rate sensor,</text><text start="74.13" dur="2.19">pulse oximeter for blood oxygen,</text><text start="76.32" dur="2.25">and of course, it still has
the interchangeable bands,</text><text start="78.57" dur="0.99">same as gen one.</text><text start="79.56" dur="3.54">And the whole thing is actually both IP 68</text><text start="83.1" dur="1.95">dust and water resistant</text><text start="85.05" dur="3.93">and reaches a US military
standard for durability.</text><text start="88.98" dur="2.67">Basically means it can also
withstand extreme temperature</text><text start="91.65" dur="0.96">and moisture</text><text start="92.61" dur="1.89">and shock among other things.
(watch taps)</text><text start="94.5" dur="2.04">It&amp;#39;s not too heavy,
it&amp;#39;s built pretty well.</text><text start="96.54" dur="3.06">This display goes up to a
thousand nits peak brightness.</text><text start="99.6" dur="3.45">So it looks good. It&amp;#39;s
built well across the board.</text><text start="103.05" dur="2.28">Nice. So what&amp;#39;s the catch?</text><text start="105.33" dur="1.14">What&amp;#39;s the weird twist?</text><text start="106.47" dur="2.4">Well at the beginning I
mentioned like we already</text><text start="108.87" dur="2.34">kind of know what a smartwatch is,</text><text start="111.21" dur="3.48">which is a tiny computer on
your wrist with a tiny screen</text><text start="114.69" dur="1.53">and a tiny battery.</text><text start="116.22" dur="0.833">And that&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="117.053" dur="3.037">Like they all tend to have
pretty short battery lives</text><text start="120.09" dur="1.35">just because they&amp;#39;re so small,</text><text start="121.44" dur="1.92">and so you kind of just
charge &amp;#39;em every day.</text><text start="123.36" dur="0.87">And that&amp;#39;s the way it is.</text><text start="124.23" dur="3.27">Like the main competitors
here are the Apple Watch,</text><text start="127.5" dur="1.26">which is 18 hours,</text><text start="128.76" dur="1.44">although that&amp;#39;s not the
most direct competitor</text><text start="130.2" dur="0.84">&amp;#39;cause that&amp;#39;s the iPhone.</text><text start="131.04" dur="2.97">But the Galaxy Watch, one of the best,</text><text start="134.01" dur="2.07">40 hours of battery,</text><text start="136.08" dur="2.28">and the Pixel Watch, the newest one,</text><text start="138.36" dur="1.41">24 hours of battery life.</text><text start="139.77" dur="4.77">But this one, OnePlus
is claiming 100 hours.</text><text start="144.54" dur="2.22">100 hour battery life in Smart Mode,</text><text start="146.76" dur="1.44">which is not the battery saving mode,</text><text start="148.2" dur="1.5">it&amp;#39;s actually the
default mode out the box.</text><text start="149.7" dur="1.95">100 hours.</text><text start="151.65" dur="2.73">So 96 hours is four days.</text><text start="154.38" dur="1.68">I feel like, you know, 100 sounds cooler</text><text start="156.06" dur="1.02">so they just went with 100.</text><text start="157.08" dur="3.96">But four days of battery
sounds a lot less inconvenient.</text><text start="161.04" dur="2.01">So, you know, I had to
put that to the test.</text><text start="163.05" dur="1.5">So for the past four straight days</text><text start="164.55" dur="2.1">I&amp;#39;ve been that guy walking around</text><text start="166.65" dur="2.34">with both an Apple Watch Ultra,</text><text start="168.99" dur="2.76">which claims 36 hours of normal use</text><text start="171.75" dur="0.96">and this thing.</text><text start="172.71" dur="2.1">Doing all the same stuff
with both watches on,</text><text start="174.81" dur="2.4">getting notifications, doing workouts,</text><text start="177.21" dur="1.77">just poking around the UI.</text><text start="178.98" dur="3.06">And by the end, I was actually
very impressed with both.</text><text start="182.04" dur="2.64">So the $800 Apple Watch Ultra</text><text start="184.68" dur="3.51">actually over performed the
36 claimed hours for me.</text><text start="188.19" dur="3.12">By hour 56 it was about ready to die.</text><text start="191.31" dur="4.26">Now meanwhile, the OnePlus
Watch had about 15% left.</text><text start="195.57" dur="0.84">Now you&amp;#39;re probably thinking, wait,</text><text start="196.41" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;s not even close to
100, it&amp;#39;s like 50 something.</text><text start="199.56" dur="1.44">But OnePlus told me that</text><text start="201" dur="2.46">if you turn the always on display off,</text><text start="203.46" dur="1.98">that&amp;#39;s good for two more
days of battery life,</text><text start="205.44" dur="1.17">it&amp;#39;s actually off by default.</text><text start="206.61" dur="1.65">I turned it on for this test,</text><text start="208.26" dur="4.17">but that would get you well
over the 100 hour mark.</text><text start="212.43" dur="1.29">To be fair, that&amp;#39;s also probably true</text><text start="213.72" dur="1.47">about the Apple Watch Ultra.</text><text start="215.19" dur="2.07">Now one detail to consider
that I think actually mattered</text><text start="217.26" dur="1.17">for this particular test.</text><text start="218.43" dur="1.53">I&amp;#39;ve been wearing hoodies a lot</text><text start="219.96" dur="1.89">&amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s that type of weather.</text><text start="221.85" dur="3.69">And so even with the sleeves
on this Chevron Hoodie,</text><text start="225.54" dur="1.35">which I&amp;#39;ll link it below</text><text start="226.89" dur="2.04">&amp;#39;cause you probably wanna check it out.</text><text start="228.93" dur="1.59">It covers the watch.</text><text start="230.52" dur="2.04">And so when you cover the
watch with your sleeve,</text><text start="232.56" dur="1.26">it thinks it&amp;#39;s in the dark</text><text start="233.82" dur="1.17">&amp;#39;cause the light sensors are covered</text><text start="234.99" dur="3.09">so it turns the brightness
way down on the watch.</text><text start="238.08" dur="2.19">And so I think that&amp;#39;s why it outperformed</text><text start="240.27" dur="1.59">the battery numbers that it&amp;#39;s claiming</text><text start="241.86" dur="1.89">is &amp;#39;cause I had a sleeve
over it a lot of the times</text><text start="243.75" dur="1.14">and the brightness was low.</text><text start="244.89" dur="3.36">But even still, this $300 watch</text><text start="248.25" dur="4.23">outperformed this $800 smartwatch
just in terms of battery.</text><text start="252.48" dur="1.17">Now here&amp;#39;s the thing.</text><text start="253.65" dur="3.6">The way that they&amp;#39;re
achieving this battery life</text><text start="257.25" dur="2.82">is, I think, more interesting
than the battery life itself.</text><text start="260.07" dur="1.08">This is the twist.</text><text start="261.15" dur="2.94">See, most smart watches
have a chip inside,</text><text start="264.09" dur="1.08">computing everything,</text><text start="265.17" dur="2.97">with some high powered cores
and some high efficiency cores</text><text start="268.14" dur="2.46">to balance out power and battery life.</text><text start="270.6" dur="4.56">This watch has two entirely
separate processors</text><text start="275.16" dur="1.92">and two different operating systems</text><text start="277.08" dur="1.83">running for each of them.</text><text start="278.91" dur="2.97">So there&amp;#39;s a high powered
Snapdragon W5 inside,</text><text start="281.88" dur="2.01">that&amp;#39;s powering Wear OS 4</text><text start="283.89" dur="3.45">and that only lights up for
things connected to that.</text><text start="287.34" dur="3.51">Then there&amp;#39;s also a BES 2,700 chip</text><text start="290.85" dur="3.21">that is always on and runs RTOS.</text><text start="294.06" dur="2.79">And they both share the
same 32 gigs of base storage</text><text start="296.85" dur="1.32">and two gigs of RAM.</text><text start="298.17" dur="4.17">So Wear OS kicks on for
the more intensive tasks</text><text start="302.34" dur="2.73">like maps or music playback.</text><text start="305.07" dur="1.98">But the RTOS that&amp;#39;s always on</text><text start="307.05" dur="2.28">is for those basic, low power tasks:</text><text start="309.33" dur="1.98">heart rate monitoring, phone calls,</text><text start="311.31" dur="1.89">notifications, background stuff.</text><text start="313.2" dur="2.01">It&amp;#39;s like a hybrid car.</text><text start="315.21" dur="1.59">It&amp;#39;s really interesting.</text><text start="316.8" dur="1.98">And a fully electric car,
you guys already know</text><text start="318.78" dur="2.34">has all the benefits of
being really responsive</text><text start="321.12" dur="2.19">but not the best range.</text><text start="323.31" dur="2.04">But a gas car has a ton of range,</text><text start="325.35" dur="2.04">just not as responsive as fully electric.</text><text start="327.39" dur="2.97">So if you get a hybrid,
best of the both worlds,</text><text start="330.36" dur="2.28">responsive and range.</text><text start="332.64" dur="4.08">And this watch, it&amp;#39;s a hybrid
with the best of both worlds,</text><text start="336.72" dur="2.34">responsiveness and range.</text><text start="339.06" dur="1.2">So I&amp;#39;ve been pretty impressed.</text><text start="340.26" dur="2.13">You know, using this
thing, it&amp;#39;s responsive.</text><text start="342.39" dur="2.58">It has a ton of watch faces.</text><text start="344.97" dur="1.59">There&amp;#39;s a lot of custom workouts</text><text start="346.56" dur="2.64">which look very familiar with tracking</text><text start="349.2" dur="1.8">and everything that
still sends all the data</text><text start="351" dur="2.76">to the OHealth app in
plenty of detail for me.</text><text start="353.76" dur="2.64">I do still wish now, shoveling
snow was a workout type,</text><text start="356.4" dur="1.17">but that&amp;#39;s another story.</text><text start="357.57" dur="2.58">But you know, these here are
regular weightlifting workouts.</text><text start="360.15" dur="2.76">And also, can I say I
really like that it is</text><text start="362.91" dur="3.24">hold to end the workout, not tap to end.</text><text start="366.15" dur="2.55">So it&amp;#39;s way harder to
accidentally stop a workout.</text><text start="368.7" dur="1.26">Great idea.</text><text start="369.96" dur="1.14">Also another weird quirk,</text><text start="371.1" dur="3.51">this button here has a crown that rotates.</text><text start="374.61" dur="2.73">But that rotation doesn&amp;#39;t
actually do anything.</text><text start="377.34" dur="1.17">It doesn&amp;#39;t change the volume,</text><text start="378.51" dur="2.19">it doesn&amp;#39;t scroll up or down in anything.</text><text start="380.7" dur="1.62">It does nothing. It&amp;#39;s not
connected to anything.</text><text start="382.32" dur="1.29">It just freely spins.</text><text start="383.61" dur="1.74">apparently, that&amp;#39;s
literally just to make it</text><text start="385.35" dur="2.22">more durable upon impact.</text><text start="387.57" dur="2.28">Doesn&amp;#39;t serve any function.</text><text start="389.85" dur="1.89">Also, it does have this weird hitch,</text><text start="391.74" dur="2.1">that it hasn&amp;#39;t really
gotten any less annoying,</text><text start="393.84" dur="1.74">which is if I get a notification,</text><text start="395.58" dur="1.65">I feel the buzz on my wrist,</text><text start="397.23" dur="1.62">then I lift up my wrist</text><text start="398.85" dur="2.22">and it takes like a full two seconds</text><text start="401.07" dur="2.37">to show me the notification I just got.</text><text start="403.44" dur="3.57">Not that two seconds is a
disaster, it&amp;#39;s not a ton of time,</text><text start="407.01" dur="2.22">but it&amp;#39;s longer than you expect,</text><text start="409.23" dur="2.13">and it kind of annoys me to have to wait</text><text start="411.36" dur="1.32">in comparison to other watches,</text><text start="412.68" dur="2.28">which will just show me the
notification right away.</text><text start="414.96" dur="2.25">And I feel like you can
actually see the moment</text><text start="417.21" dur="2.43">that it fires up the Snapdragon W5</text><text start="419.64" dur="2.94">and Wear OS kind of snaps
on right in front of you</text><text start="422.58" dur="1.71">before it shows you that notification.</text><text start="424.29" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s very odd.</text><text start="425.123" dur="1.477">But here&amp;#39;s the other twist on top of</text><text start="426.6" dur="1.86">everything we&amp;#39;ve already talked about.</text><text start="428.46" dur="2.76">I don&amp;#39;t think this dual chip system</text><text start="431.22" dur="3.81">is all of the magic creating
this great battery life,</text><text start="435.03" dur="3.21">because this watch also has
a 500 MilliAmp hour battery.</text><text start="438.24" dur="1.77">Now 500 MilliAmp hours
doesn&amp;#39;t sound like a lot,</text><text start="440.01" dur="2.73">but here&amp;#39;s the sizes
of other smart watches</text><text start="442.74" dur="2.22">in competition with this
and their battery sizes</text><text start="444.96" dur="1.95">and how long they last.</text><text start="446.91" dur="1.89">And it&amp;#39;s a little bigger
than you&amp;#39;d expect.</text><text start="448.8" dur="2.7">Now if I gave the Pixel Watch 2,</text><text start="451.5" dur="2.64">which also has a
Snapdragon W5, by the way.</text><text start="454.14" dur="3.48">If I gave the Pixel Watch 2
a 500 MilliAmp hour battery,</text><text start="457.62" dur="4.05">do we think it would last 50 hours?</text><text start="461.67" dur="2.61">I don&amp;#39;t know, but there you go.</text><text start="464.28" dur="0.93">Honestly, at the end of the day</text><text start="465.21" dur="2.13">I just came away from
this mostly just impressed</text><text start="467.34" dur="3.66">that they actually kept the
price of this watch so low.</text><text start="471" dur="2.61">Because two chips and two OSs</text><text start="473.61" dur="1.83">and the work that goes into that,</text><text start="475.44" dur="1.8">I dunno, to me that just sounds expensive</text><text start="477.24" dur="2.67">and it&amp;#39;s really not missing
anything else too drastic.</text><text start="479.91" dur="2.73">I think it&amp;#39;s competitive in a
lot of good ways at 300 bucks.</text><text start="482.64" dur="2.28">So I think the clear positives would be:</text><text start="484.92" dur="3.18">a nice design, really classy
looking design, nice display,</text><text start="488.1" dur="2.94">dual frequency GPS, so
that&amp;#39;s for better accuracy,</text><text start="491.04" dur="3">and then of course
really good battery life.</text><text start="494.04" dur="2.37">The four days we talked about is awesome,</text><text start="496.41" dur="1.47">but if you put on power saver mode,</text><text start="497.88" dur="2.4">it&amp;#39;s up to 12 days of battery life.</text><text start="500.28" dur="2.97">Now this is gonna disable a
lot of the Wear OS things,</text><text start="503.25" dur="3.75">so it&amp;#39;s just basic stuff,
exercises, heart rate monitoring,</text><text start="507" dur="2.76">but you could get it to really
last a week if you wanted to.</text><text start="509.76" dur="1.2">But then the weaknesses are</text><text start="510.96" dur="2.85">definitely the delay in
checking your notifications.</text><text start="513.81" dur="2.07">The haptics also aren&amp;#39;t that nice,</text><text start="515.88" dur="1.23">and there&amp;#39;s no iPhone compatibility,</text><text start="517.11" dur="1.68">but you already knew that.</text><text start="518.79" dur="4.11">But I would also say the
charger is not that cool.</text><text start="522.9" dur="1.02">Honestly, it&amp;#39;s kind of clunky.</text><text start="523.92" dur="2.04">I mean it works perfectly
fine, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong,</text><text start="525.96" dur="1.8">but it&amp;#39;s just like a big plastic block</text><text start="527.76" dur="1.8">with pins and magnets in it.</text><text start="529.56" dur="2.52">But it&amp;#39;ll get you a full
day&amp;#39;s charge in 10 minutes</text><text start="532.08" dur="2.1">and a full charge in an hour.</text><text start="534.18" dur="0.93">So that&amp;#39;s acceptable.</text><text start="535.11" dur="3.84">But for 300 bucks, I&amp;#39;d say
OnePlus has redeemed itself</text><text start="538.95" dur="1.86">from its previous
efforts in smart watches.</text><text start="540.81" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s pretty good.</text><text start="541.643" dur="1.447">Like in a world of smartwatch gimmicks,</text><text start="543.09" dur="2.4">there&amp;#39;s the one with earbuds inside,</text><text start="545.49" dur="2.25">there&amp;#39;s the one for fitness,</text><text start="547.74" dur="2.07">there&amp;#39;s the one for the iPhone.</text><text start="549.81" dur="3.03">Maybe this is the one
with the hybrid system</text><text start="552.84" dur="2.496">and pretty good battery life.</text><text start="555.336" dur="1.584">(upbeat music)
Maybe that&amp;#39;s enough for you.</text><text start="556.92" dur="1.59">Let me know in the comments below.</text><text start="558.51" dur="1.92">Either way, that&amp;#39;s been it.</text><text start="560.43" dur="1.17">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="561.6" dur="2.236">Catch you the next one. Peace.</text><text start="563.836" dur="2.667">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
