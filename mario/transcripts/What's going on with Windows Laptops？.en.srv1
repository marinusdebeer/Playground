<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.126" dur="3.024">(Windows chiming)</text><text start="3.15" dur="1.65">- Okay, I&amp;#39;ve been waiting
for this for a while.</text><text start="4.8" dur="1.65">As someone who&amp;#39;s been on the sidelines</text><text start="6.45" dur="1.8">of the Windows game for a little while now</text><text start="8.25" dur="1.71">and seeing all this hype</text><text start="9.96" dur="1.65">and this new matte black laptop</text><text start="11.61" dur="2.28">that&amp;#39;s supposed to be generational,</text><text start="13.89" dur="1.05">it&amp;#39;s got me thinking,</text><text start="16.11" dur="1.89">is it legit?</text><text start="18" dur="2.85">Like have Windows laptops
actually caught up</text><text start="20.85" dur="2.4">to the Apple Silicon leap
from a couple years ago?</text><text start="23.25" dur="2.25">Because this is a new
Microsoft Surface laptop</text><text start="25.5" dur="1.71">and it doesn&amp;#39;t have an Intel chip inside,</text><text start="27.21" dur="1.56">it doesn&amp;#39;t have an AMD chip inside,</text><text start="28.77" dur="3.51">this laptop has a Qualcomm
Snapdragon X Elite chip inside,</text><text start="32.28" dur="1.8">meaning it is an ARM laptop.</text><text start="34.08" dur="2.55">Now, years ago, Apple went
through this transition</text><text start="36.63" dur="2.32">from Intel chips to ARM chips</text><text start="38.95" dur="2.12">and it was crazy successful,</text><text start="41.07" dur="2.49">like, no one could really
match their efficiency</text><text start="43.56" dur="1.44">and seamless integration,</text><text start="45" dur="0.9">the vertical integration,</text><text start="45.9" dur="2.43">the overall package of their laptops</text><text start="48.33" dur="1.56">just took a quantum leap forward.</text><text start="49.89" dur="2.61">Now Windows laptops around
the same time, actually,</text><text start="52.5" dur="1.59">if you remember kind of
tried the same thing,</text><text start="54.09" dur="2.278">I don&amp;#39;t know if you
remember the Surface Pro X,</text><text start="56.368" dur="1.712">that didn&amp;#39;t go so well</text><text start="58.08" dur="1.68">and so we&amp;#39;ve continued to have</text><text start="59.76" dur="1.98">Intel and AMD laptops since then.</text><text start="61.74" dur="3.9">But it seems like this
one has gone way better.</text><text start="65.64" dur="2.16">So I&amp;#39;ve been using this laptop
for the past couple weeks,</text><text start="67.8" dur="1.98">you might have seen me with
it on the Waveform Podcast,</text><text start="69.78" dur="3.45">and I&amp;#39;ve got a pretty good
idea now of what&amp;#39;s gone well</text><text start="73.23" dur="2.85">and what is still a trade off.</text><text start="76.08" dur="1.08">So the big advantage,</text><text start="77.16" dur="3.09">the mega quantum leap
forward was inefficiency,</text><text start="80.25" dur="2.16">which in a laptop with
the same size battery</text><text start="82.41" dur="2.28">means a dramatically
improved battery life,</text><text start="84.69" dur="3.09">and this laptop absolutely
got a big bump up.</text><text start="87.78" dur="2.67">So I remember reading reviews
of the last Surface laptop</text><text start="90.45" dur="1.02">with an Intel chip,</text><text start="91.47" dur="1.92">which already had a
pretty solid battery life,</text><text start="93.39" dur="2.34">and the Microsoft quote was 19 hours.</text><text start="95.73" dur="3.3">This one&amp;#39;s quote is 23 hours,</text><text start="99.03" dur="1.68">but what that&amp;#39;s translated to for me,</text><text start="100.71" dur="1.83">basically, is all day battery life</text><text start="102.54" dur="1.71">for mixed use with no worries,</text><text start="104.25" dur="3.21">like, that&amp;#39;s high brightness,
web browsing, email,</text><text start="107.46" dur="2.88">watching videos, research type activities,</text><text start="110.34" dur="2.97">and then, ending the
day at like 40% easily.</text><text start="113.31" dur="2.13">So I just really don&amp;#39;t
think about charging much,</text><text start="115.44" dur="2.28">which is awesome for a 14-inch laptop.</text><text start="117.72" dur="1.38">On paper, it&amp;#39;s getting compared a lot</text><text start="119.1" dur="3.489">to the M3 13-inch MacBook Air</text><text start="122.589" dur="3.381">and it even outlasts it on
some synthetic benchmarks,</text><text start="125.97" dur="1.14">which is awesome.</text><text start="127.11" dur="2.49">So that&amp;#39;s one success,
definitely check the box,</text><text start="129.6" dur="1.83">great battery life, love that.</text><text start="131.43" dur="2.19">And then, the other second success</text><text start="133.62" dur="1.05">that we were looking forward to</text><text start="134.67" dur="3.594">was just a well optimized performance.</text><text start="138.264" dur="3.216">And it&amp;#39;s not like the super
high end gaming performance,</text><text start="141.48" dur="1.59">I&amp;#39;m not talking about
that type of performance,</text><text start="143.07" dur="3.72">but I just mean like a general
smoothness and consistency</text><text start="146.79" dur="1.56">and rock solid performance</text><text start="148.35" dur="2.07">across all your everyday regular tasks,</text><text start="150.42" dur="0.96">that sort of performance.</text><text start="151.38" dur="2.16">Now I&amp;#39;m gonna get into
app support in a minute,</text><text start="153.54" dur="3.09">but I basically found this
to be a very capable laptop.</text><text start="156.63" dur="1.5">Now again, I&amp;#39;ve been on the sidelines</text><text start="158.13" dur="1.05">from Windows for a bit,</text><text start="159.18" dur="1.8">so I don&amp;#39;t have as many reference points,</text><text start="160.98" dur="3.06">but this is a $2,000 14-inch laptop</text><text start="164.04" dur="2.28">that can basically do anything I ask of it</text><text start="166.32" dur="0.99">without breaking a sweat.</text><text start="167.31" dur="2.176">Photo editing in Affinity, not a problem.</text><text start="169.486" dur="2.504">Literally anything in the
Microsoft Office Suite,</text><text start="171.99" dur="2.25">no problem, whether
you&amp;#39;re plugged in or not.</text><text start="174.24" dur="2.31">You know, I found the track
pad gestures are pretty smooth,</text><text start="176.55" dur="2.19">the graphics of the whole UI in general</text><text start="178.74" dur="3.09">are consistent from full
battery to nearly dead.</text><text start="181.83" dur="2.79">So using a software
that runs natively on it</text><text start="184.62" dur="2.19">is snappy and a great experience.</text><text start="186.81" dur="2.46">But that very quickly gets
you into the conversation</text><text start="189.27" dur="3.06">about the downside of switching to ARM.</text><text start="192.33" dur="3.99">This is what I was curious
about repeating from last time,</text><text start="196.32" dur="2.22">and this actually happened
in the Mac world too</text><text start="198.54" dur="1.26">when they made this transition,</text><text start="199.8" dur="1.8">the number one difficulty</text><text start="201.6" dur="3.828">to changing the entire
architecture of your computer</text><text start="205.428" dur="2.142">is actually app compatibility.</text><text start="207.57" dur="1.71">So I remember, when the
Mac went through this,</text><text start="209.28" dur="2.871">there were basically three types of apps.</text><text start="212.151" dur="3.669">There&amp;#39;s obviously optimized
apps at the top of the list,</text><text start="215.82" dur="1.35">like that&amp;#39;s the ideal,</text><text start="217.17" dur="1.41">obviously, all the first party apps</text><text start="218.58" dur="1.11">are optimized off the bat</text><text start="219.69" dur="1.29">and Apple did a lot of work</text><text start="220.98" dur="2.28">trying to get as many
developers onboard as possible</text><text start="223.26" dur="2.46">to get their apps optimized on ARM.</text><text start="225.72" dur="4.26">But then there were apps
that were built for x86</text><text start="229.98" dur="4.05">but would still work on
ARM through emulation.</text><text start="234.03" dur="3.63">So they&amp;#39;d not perform necessarily
as well as they could,</text><text start="237.66" dur="2.34">but at least they worked anyway.</text><text start="240" dur="2.22">And then, there were apps
that just didn&amp;#39;t work at all.</text><text start="242.22" dur="2.01">So right now for Windows on ARM,</text><text start="244.23" dur="2.28">you have these three types of apps again,</text><text start="246.51" dur="1.41">and my assessment is that,</text><text start="247.92" dur="1.53">at this very moment,</text><text start="249.45" dur="2.52">there&amp;#39;s pretty good
support for native apps</text><text start="251.97" dur="2.07">as far as things people use every day.</text><text start="254.04" dur="2.34">But it&amp;#39;s definitely still not perfect.</text><text start="256.38" dur="3.06">So, okay, Photoshop and
Lightroom CC run native,</text><text start="259.44" dur="4.56">Chrome, Spotify, Prime
Video, Dropbox, Zoom,</text><text start="264" dur="1.8">like there&amp;#39;s a lot of
popular apps across the board</text><text start="265.8" dur="0.96">that just run natively</text><text start="266.76" dur="1.41">and they&amp;#39;re super smooth
and they&amp;#39;re great,</text><text start="268.17" dur="2.34">they don&amp;#39;t hit battery
hard at all, love that.</text><text start="270.51" dur="1.89">So then there are some apps that I used</text><text start="272.4" dur="3">that don&amp;#39;t support Windows on ARM</text><text start="275.4" dur="5">but do get emulated, so
they still work technically.</text><text start="280.53" dur="2.76">So Lightroom Classic is a big one,</text><text start="283.29" dur="2.577">my to-do list app of Choice is TickTick,</text><text start="285.867" dur="0.933">you might have heard of it,</text><text start="286.8" dur="1.8">I&amp;#39;ve referenced it a few times
and it&amp;#39;s a great example.</text><text start="288.6" dur="1.14">If you go to their website,</text><text start="289.74" dur="2.4">they only have x86 versions of the app</text><text start="292.14" dur="5">and I downloaded and ran the
64 bit version and it works,</text><text start="297.15" dur="2.7">but it doesn&amp;#39;t actually run very well.</text><text start="299.85" dur="3.48">I actually notice some
real chop and some lag</text><text start="303.33" dur="1.86">with certain parts of the UI,</text><text start="305.19" dur="1.38">and it&amp;#39;s not even that heavy of an app,</text><text start="306.57" dur="1.14">it&amp;#39;s just a to-do list app.</text><text start="307.71" dur="3.9">And there&amp;#39;s a long list of apps
in this sort of limbo phase</text><text start="311.61" dur="1.86">where you don&amp;#39;t necessarily know</text><text start="313.47" dur="1.86">if there&amp;#39;s going to be an ARM native app</text><text start="315.33" dur="1.2">around the corner or not</text><text start="316.53" dur="1.32">&amp;#39;cause adoption&amp;#39;s not super high,</text><text start="317.85" dur="3.136">it&amp;#39;s not really a huge incentive
for them to make one yet,</text><text start="320.986" dur="2.024">but you can still use it,</text><text start="323.01" dur="2.4">it&amp;#39;s just not gonna be
the ideal experience.</text><text start="325.41" dur="2.73">It might churn through
battery a little bit quickly,</text><text start="328.14" dur="1.14">but it still works.</text><text start="329.28" dur="1.08">But then there are just apps</text><text start="330.36" dur="2.816">that straight up don&amp;#39;t work at all yet.</text><text start="333.176" dur="3.604">Arc browser, Google Drive on desktop,</text><text start="336.78" dur="1.38">I rely heavily on that,</text><text start="338.16" dur="1.92">that does not have any
compatibility at all</text><text start="340.08" dur="1.83">with Windows on ARM,</text><text start="341.91" dur="3.63">VMware doesn&amp;#39;t work, a
lot of VPNs don&amp;#39;t work,</text><text start="345.54" dur="2.22">and a lot of games straight up don&amp;#39;t run,</text><text start="347.76" dur="1.26">like some of &amp;#39;em are uncompatible,</text><text start="349.02" dur="3.6">but also a lot of them which
might have ordinarily run</text><text start="352.62" dur="4.08">have anti-cheat software that
doesn&amp;#39;t run on Windows on ARM</text><text start="356.7" dur="1.77">so the game just doesn&amp;#39;t work at all.</text><text start="358.47" dur="0.87">And there&amp;#39;s even some apps</text><text start="359.34" dur="2.16">that actually now that I
think about it are compatible,</text><text start="361.5" dur="3.09">but their websites for the
companies that make them</text><text start="364.59" dur="3.24">don&amp;#39;t actually highlight
or prominently show</text><text start="367.83" dur="1.83">the download for the ARM version,</text><text start="369.66" dur="1.92">so it&amp;#39;s kind of confusing
and it&amp;#39;s hard to find.</text><text start="371.58" dur="2.22">So it&amp;#39;s just kind of all
over the place right now.</text><text start="373.8" dur="1.26">So my take here is,</text><text start="375.06" dur="3.99">look, if you are at all
considering a Windows ARM laptop,</text><text start="379.05" dur="3.09">specifically, look up the
apps that you have to use</text><text start="382.14" dur="1.65">and make sure they&amp;#39;re at least compatible,</text><text start="383.79" dur="1.05">at least emulatable</text><text start="384.84" dur="1.2">&amp;#39;cause there might be some promises</text><text start="386.04" dur="1.44">of ARM versions coming soon,</text><text start="387.48" dur="1.56">or just statements from a developer,</text><text start="389.04" dur="1.05">I&amp;#39;ve seen lots of those.</text><text start="390.09" dur="2.07">But just check the programs that you know</text><text start="392.16" dur="2.73">you&amp;#39;re gonna need to work
because, depending on who you are,</text><text start="394.89" dur="3.3">you could be totally covered
and fine or totally outta luck.</text><text start="398.19" dur="2.49">So there are a couple Windows
ARM laptops out there,</text><text start="400.68" dur="1.98">this is the one I obviously
chose to mess with,</text><text start="402.66" dur="3.543">the premium matte black one
with the Snapdragon X Elite.</text><text start="407.46" dur="1.71">So here&amp;#39;s a couple more of my observations</text><text start="409.17" dur="2.85">scattered from my couple
of weeks of using it.</text><text start="412.02" dur="2.46">I gotta say the build
quality is pretty awesome,</text><text start="414.48" dur="2.31">as they have been with Surface
for a little while now.</text><text start="416.79" dur="1.44">I love the all metal design,</text><text start="418.23" dur="1.26">the keyboard&amp;#39;s rock solid,</text><text start="419.49" dur="2.61">big track pad with excellent haptics,</text><text start="422.1" dur="1.98">and just really good
fundamentals all around.</text><text start="424.08" dur="1.68">The port selection is all right,</text><text start="425.76" dur="1.68">it&amp;#39;s still got that full size USB-A</text><text start="427.44" dur="2.58">and then there&amp;#39;s two USB-C
with the headphone jack.</text><text start="430.02" dur="1.86">My only real downside I would say</text><text start="431.88" dur="2.25">with it getting as pricey as it can get</text><text start="434.13" dur="2.25">is that there is no OLED option.</text><text start="436.38" dur="3.72">So instead it&amp;#39;s a 2304x1536,</text><text start="440.1" dur="2.58">120 hertz LCD touchscreen</text><text start="442.68" dur="1.56">with that 3x2 aspect ratio,</text><text start="444.24" dur="1.17">and I love that it&amp;#39;s tall,</text><text start="445.41" dur="3.21">it&amp;#39;s just, it can&amp;#39;t quite
match the deep blacks</text><text start="448.62" dur="1.77">and contrast of an OLED, obviously,</text><text start="450.39" dur="1.44">even though it&amp;#39;s a pretty good LCD.</text><text start="451.83" dur="2.91">So I just feel like I
basically traded the OLED</text><text start="454.74" dur="1.41">for a high refresh rate here,</text><text start="456.15" dur="2.25">but I would&amp;#39;ve liked to
have seen an OLED option.</text><text start="458.4" dur="1.92">And then just know that it&amp;#39;s not,</text><text start="460.32" dur="2.4">like, it&amp;#39;s not like a
super high-end gaming PC.</text><text start="462.72" dur="2.55">It&amp;#39;s very strong in
performance across the board,</text><text start="465.27" dur="2.1">it&amp;#39;ll do all the other things.</text><text start="467.37" dur="2.7">But similar to Apple&amp;#39;s M Series laptops,</text><text start="470.07" dur="1.92">like it&amp;#39;s a built-in GPU,</text><text start="471.99" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s not gonna be as
powerful as a dedicated GPU.</text><text start="475.17" dur="2.991">So don&amp;#39;t expect, I mean, you
can still play some games,</text><text start="478.161" dur="2.409">sure, but you&amp;#39;re not getting this laptop</text><text start="480.57" dur="2.22">to max out frame rates in
&amp;quot;Elden Ring&amp;quot; or something.</text><text start="482.79" dur="1.17">If you study the benchmarks enough,</text><text start="483.96" dur="3.27">you&amp;#39;ll find that these
chips have a lot of cores,</text><text start="487.23" dur="2.744">but weaker individual performance</text><text start="489.974" dur="1.816">on like a single core basis.</text><text start="491.79" dur="2.46">So it&amp;#39;s good at throwing
a lot of cores at tasks</text><text start="494.25" dur="2.91">and getting things done and
that&amp;#39;s nice, just note that.</text><text start="497.16" dur="3.72">And it&amp;#39;s generally pretty
good at staying cool</text><text start="500.88" dur="2.7">and not spinning up the fans,
which I also think is great.</text><text start="503.58" dur="0.833">And then, of course,</text><text start="504.413" dur="3.067">this is also one of the
very first copilot PCs,</text><text start="507.48" dur="3.09">so it&amp;#39;s got the dedicated
copilot button on the keyboard.</text><text start="510.57" dur="2.58">And so, yeah, this chip has an NPU,</text><text start="513.15" dur="2.73">which does specific AI related processing.</text><text start="515.88" dur="2.58">Things like the studio camera effects</text><text start="518.46" dur="1.5">that are built into the camera</text><text start="519.96" dur="3.51">or the forced artificial
eye contact in the camera,</text><text start="523.47" dur="1.83">and it&amp;#39;ll do it without pulling anything</text><text start="525.3" dur="1.443">from the CPU or GPU.</text><text start="526.743" dur="2.217">And, of course, you can
always hit that copilot button</text><text start="528.96" dur="1.65">to talk to Microsoft Copilot,</text><text start="530.61" dur="1.17">ask it anything,</text><text start="531.78" dur="3.72">the same way you&amp;#39;d talk to
Bing or ChatGPT or Gemini.</text><text start="535.5" dur="4.14">But overall, this laptop
is a good start, I think.</text><text start="539.64" dur="1.23">I mean, I&amp;#39;ve been waiting personally</text><text start="540.87" dur="3.54">for a premium built matte
black Windows laptop</text><text start="544.41" dur="2.85">for a while on ARM and this is that,</text><text start="547.26" dur="2.1">it&amp;#39;s actually what we&amp;#39;ve been waiting for.</text><text start="550.29" dur="1.32">I think the question really is,</text><text start="551.61" dur="3.87">does the software you use work on ARM?</text><text start="555.48" dur="1.92">Like, that&amp;#39;s the main question
you should be considering</text><text start="557.4" dur="1.77">when thinking about if you&amp;#39;re
gonna buy one of these things.</text><text start="559.17" dur="1.44">Now, before you go, here&amp;#39;s a question.</text><text start="560.61" dur="1.83">Have you ever looked at
a laptop or a smartphone</text><text start="562.44" dur="3.39">and wondered, what&amp;#39;s going on inside it?</text><text start="565.83" dur="2.82">Because channel sponsor
dbrand has your answers.</text><text start="568.65" dur="1.14">Now you&amp;#39;ve seen, for years now,</text><text start="569.79" dur="1.08">one of my favorite party tricks</text><text start="570.87" dur="2.28">has been this sheet of magnet paper.</text><text start="573.15" dur="1.35">You just lay it down on any device</text><text start="574.5" dur="1.86">to see where a few of the internals are,</text><text start="576.36" dur="2.76">like the MagSafe magnet
array or the speaker.</text><text start="579.12" dur="3.39">dbrand&amp;#39;s x-ray line takes
that magnet paper experience</text><text start="582.51" dur="1.05">to a whole nother level,</text><text start="583.56" dur="1.92">letting you see basically
every single component</text><text start="585.48" dur="0.87">inside your device,</text><text start="586.35" dur="3.75">and yes, this is an actual
legit X-ray of that device.</text><text start="590.1" dur="3.51">Yes, dbrand took hundreds of
