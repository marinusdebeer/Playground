<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.12" dur="4.35">- The most dangerous thing
about the Tesla Cybertruck</text><text start="4.47" dur="2.55">is not the pointy edges and corners.</text><text start="7.02" dur="2.16">It&amp;#39;s not the fact that
it weighs over three tons</text><text start="9.18" dur="1.77">and goes from zero to 60 miles an hour</text><text start="10.95" dur="1.5">faster than a Corvette.</text><text start="12.45" dur="1.59">It&amp;#39;s not even the way that reflections</text><text start="14.04" dur="1.5">glare off the stainless steel</text><text start="15.54" dur="2.04">and can blind people on the highway.</text><text start="17.58" dur="3.76">No, the most dangerous
thing about the Cybertruck</text><text start="22.2" dur="1.8">is the way it makes other people</text><text start="24" dur="2.043">around you on the road behave.</text><text start="27.054" dur="2.75">(rhythmic music)</text><text start="35.909" dur="2.833">(music continues)</text><text start="44.762" dur="2.833">(music continues)</text><text start="53.528" dur="2.833">(music continues)</text><text start="60.24" dur="3.66">Okay, I genuinely can&amp;#39;t
tell if the Cybertruck</text><text start="63.9" dur="3.96">is good looking or not, and
I&amp;#39;m being completely serious.</text><text start="67.86" dur="2.19">Like if you just check the
comment section online,</text><text start="70.05" dur="1.89">it&amp;#39;s actually mostly negative.</text><text start="71.94" dur="1.47">Most people are saying it looks horrible.</text><text start="73.41" dur="2.04">It looks like a refrigerator on wheels.</text><text start="75.45" dur="1.95">It&amp;#39;s a disaster of a design.</text><text start="77.4" dur="1.59">But once you start living with this thing,</text><text start="78.99" dur="2.28">you drive around with it and
you talk to people about it</text><text start="81.27" dur="1.47">who have never heard of it,</text><text start="82.74" dur="1.98">they&amp;#39;re saying things
like, &amp;quot;This is crazy.</text><text start="84.72" dur="1.62">This is like a movie prop.</text><text start="86.34" dur="3.36">It&amp;#39;s sci-fi, looks something alien.&amp;quot;</text><text start="89.7" dur="2.13">So there&amp;#39;s a lot to it.</text><text start="91.83" dur="3.48">Here, first of all, stainless
steel and black plastic.</text><text start="95.31" dur="1.223">That&amp;#39;s mostly what
you&amp;#39;re working with here.</text><text start="96.533" dur="3.247">And the front, I think
it has a good angle.</text><text start="99.78" dur="2.13">To be honest, I&amp;#39;m a
sucker for a light bar,</text><text start="101.91" dur="2.1">but the actual headlights are down here</text><text start="104.01" dur="1.68">so they stay outta people&amp;#39;s eyes.</text><text start="105.69" dur="2.97">In general, it&amp;#39;s like a square jawline,</text><text start="108.66" dur="2.34">no curves, just angles.</text><text start="111" dur="4.02">But the back, the back not so much.</text><text start="115.02" dur="2.04">You know, it&amp;#39;s still
technically a bar, yes,</text><text start="117.06" dur="2.64">but it&amp;#39;s a little bit
dinker in my opinion.</text><text start="119.7" dur="3.54">And also just tons of
black plastic in the back.</text><text start="123.24" dur="1.89">Really high tailgate.</text><text start="125.13" dur="2.91">I&amp;#39;m getting like, dump
truck vibes from back here.</text><text start="128.04" dur="1.56">I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m the only one.</text><text start="129.6" dur="2.04">I just, I don&amp;#39;t think the
back is its best angle.</text><text start="131.64" dur="1.89">But if I had to narrow it down,</text><text start="133.53" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the most
iconic profile is the side.</text><text start="137.4" dur="1.74">And the two elements of this truck</text><text start="139.14" dur="5">that really stand out are this
slope, these high shoulders,</text><text start="144.27" dur="2.58">and then the pointy
corners on the other side.</text><text start="146.85" dur="3.69">See, most pickup trucks have
basically this general shape.</text><text start="150.54" dur="2.1">It&amp;#39;s the traditional pickup truck look.</text><text start="152.64" dur="3.78">And so we&amp;#39;re not used to
seeing this angle right here</text><text start="156.42" dur="3.06">and this huge slope right here.</text><text start="159.48" dur="2.97">It&amp;#39;s unusual, it&amp;#39;s weird, it&amp;#39;s
very visually interesting.</text><text start="162.45" dur="1.74">So I&amp;#39;ve been living with the Cybertruck</text><text start="164.19" dur="4.29">for about a month now,
well over 1,500 miles.</text><text start="168.48" dur="1.05">And you notice a couple things.</text><text start="169.53" dur="2.88">First of all, people, whenever
you go park somewhere,</text><text start="172.41" dur="2.213">always wanna come up to
you and talk about it.</text><text start="174.623" dur="2.587">Naturally, I&amp;#39;ve entertained
a lot of these conversations</text><text start="177.21" dur="1.14">&amp;#39;cause they&amp;#39;re fun.</text><text start="178.35" dur="2.88">And they usually say two things.</text><text start="181.23" dur="1.38">One, you&amp;#39;d be surprised</text><text start="182.61" dur="2.34">how many people have never
heard of the Cybertruck.</text><text start="184.95" dur="3.03">I know for us online people,
people watching this video,</text><text start="187.98" dur="1.62">you&amp;#39;re like, how could
anyone have not heard</text><text start="189.6" dur="1.47">of the Tesla Cybertruck?</text><text start="191.07" dur="1.59">But you&amp;#39;d be shocked.</text><text start="192.66" dur="2.79">And two, most people just want to know,</text><text start="195.45" dur="2.04">how much does that thing cost?</text><text start="197.49" dur="1.56">And I got asked that so many times,</text><text start="199.05" dur="2.34">eventually I just started
having people guess.</text><text start="201.39" dur="4.38">And 100% of the people
who guessed were too high.</text><text start="205.77" dur="4.35">People were guessing
$250, $300K, $180K, $150K.</text><text start="210.12" dur="1.359">They&amp;#39;re all way over.</text><text start="211.479" dur="1.371">But you know, how could they know?</text><text start="212.85" dur="1.74">They don&amp;#39;t know what the
rest of the truck is.</text><text start="214.59" dur="0.99">They&amp;#39;ve just seen this thing</text><text start="215.58" dur="2.31">they&amp;#39;ve never seen for the first time.</text><text start="217.89" dur="3.09">And so I guess the conclusion is the looks</text><text start="220.98" dur="3">are really distracting
people from the rest</text><text start="223.98" dur="3.45">of what makes the
Cybertruck, the Cybertruck.</text><text start="227.43" dur="2.22">Okay, let&amp;#39;s play a little game.</text><text start="229.65" dur="1.83">I&amp;#39;m going to name a feature</text><text start="231.48" dur="2.43">and all you have to do is
think about it for a second</text><text start="233.91" dur="4.14">and think about if you believe
it&amp;#39;s overrated or underrated.</text><text start="238.05" dur="2.01">And then I, someone who&amp;#39;s
been driving this truck,</text><text start="240.06" dur="2.16">will tell you the real answer.</text><text start="242.22" dur="3.18">So first feature, steer by wire.</text><text start="245.4" dur="1.41">I&amp;#39;ve seen a few good pieces cover</text><text start="246.81" dur="0.99">what&amp;#39;s actually happening here,</text><text start="247.8" dur="2.55">talking about the complete
physical disconnect</text><text start="250.35" dur="2.13">between the steering wheel you&amp;#39;re holding</text><text start="252.48" dur="1.92">and the wheels that are
moving under the truck.</text><text start="254.4" dur="2.67">Instead, it&amp;#39;s a bunch of
sensors reacting to your input</text><text start="257.07" dur="1.35">like a video game controller.</text><text start="258.42" dur="2.43">But combined with the
variable steering ratio</text><text start="260.85" dur="1.8">and the four wheel steering,</text><text start="262.65" dur="4.05">this is the most nimble,
agile-feeling truck</text><text start="266.7" dur="1.11">that I have ever driven.</text><text start="267.81" dur="2.37">And I don&amp;#39;t think a lot
of people realize that.</text><text start="270.18" dur="1.47">So I&amp;#39;m going underrated.</text><text start="271.65" dur="2.01">It&amp;#39;s one of those things
where Tesla definitely</text><text start="273.66" dur="1.2">didn&amp;#39;t have to do this.</text><text start="274.86" dur="2.46">Like, they&amp;#39;ve made their
headlines already with the looks.</text><text start="277.32" dur="2.1">It could just be a Model 3 underneath.</text><text start="279.42" dur="2.22">But they went through the extra measures</text><text start="281.64" dur="1.44">and the extra engineering</text><text start="283.08" dur="2.425">to ship a full steer by wire system</text><text start="285.505" dur="4.025">and all the redundancies that
come with making it safe.</text><text start="289.53" dur="1.77">I believe they&amp;#39;re the
first ones to do this.</text><text start="291.3" dur="1.68">But the variable steering ratio is really</text><text start="292.98" dur="1.26">what gives it all of its utility.</text><text start="294.24" dur="2.13">So at low speeds, the ability</text><text start="296.37" dur="2.67">to turn really quickly gets dialed up.</text><text start="299.04" dur="2.04">It&amp;#39;s a much more
responsive-feeling steering wheel.</text><text start="301.08" dur="3.27">So if I want to turn right
here, I only have to give it</text><text start="304.35" dur="2.07">what, half a turn, a quarter turn,</text><text start="306.42" dur="1.17">and I&amp;#39;m fully maneuvering.</text><text start="307.59" dur="1.77">The way you can pull into parking spots</text><text start="309.36" dur="2.13">and make 90 degree turns and everything</text><text start="311.49" dur="1.8">is a total game changer.</text><text start="313.29" dur="3.96">But then at highway speeds
it softens that ratio a lot.</text><text start="317.25" dur="1.62">So you have a little bit of steering input</text><text start="318.87" dur="3.18">to sort of glide left and
right between different lanes.</text><text start="322.05" dur="1.44">It&amp;#39;s much more subtle.</text><text start="323.49" dur="1.2">You kind of need that.</text><text start="324.69" dur="2.61">But then on top of that, throw
in the four wheel steering.</text><text start="327.3" dur="1.47">So four wheel steering is not new,</text><text start="328.77" dur="1.08">lots of vehicles have done it.</text><text start="329.85" dur="2.22">But the amount of steer</text><text start="332.07" dur="2.97">that you get from these rear
wheels is pretty dramatic</text><text start="335.04" dur="1.41">to the point where you
can look in the mirrors</text><text start="336.45" dur="2.43">and see those wheels turning.</text><text start="338.88" dur="1.65">And this can also be
adjusted with software.</text><text start="340.53" dur="3.42">But that really lets this
huge truck basically pivot</text><text start="343.95" dur="2.25">around a much smaller axis.</text><text start="346.2" dur="2.22">The steering ratio now I think gives it</text><text start="348.42" dur="2.1">the same steering circle as a Model S,</text><text start="350.52" dur="2.43">but it feels really, really impressive</text><text start="352.95" dur="2.16">just because of how big
the actual vehicle is.</text><text start="355.11" dur="1.29">It definitely takes some getting used to.</text><text start="356.4" dur="1.47">You can&amp;#39;t ignore that fact.</text><text start="357.87" dur="1.47">But once you get used to it,</text><text start="359.34" dur="3">you literally feel like when
you go back to like, an F-150</text><text start="362.34" dur="1.11">or any other truck where you have</text><text start="363.45" dur="2.67">all this hand over hand
steering to do the K turns,</text><text start="366.12" dur="2.471">that feels weird, it feels archaic.</text><text start="368.591" dur="1.879">It feels like you
shouldn&amp;#39;t have to do that.</text><text start="370.47" dur="2.04">So again, Tesla definitely
didn&amp;#39;t have to do that,</text><text start="372.51" dur="3.87">but just the way you can
drive it like a smaller car</text><text start="376.38" dur="1.61">and really point the nose,</text><text start="377.99" dur="3.07">I don&amp;#39;t know, it&amp;#39;s definitely underrated.</text><text start="381.06" dur="4.68">All right, next feature,
bulletproof stainless steel,</text><text start="385.74" dur="1.353">overrated or underrated?</text><text start="388.503" dur="2.487">I&amp;#39;m going with, you probably
saw this one coming,</text><text start="390.99" dur="1.26">I&amp;#39;m going with overrated.</text><text start="392.25" dur="1.327">Now look, first of all I get it.</text><text start="393.577" dur="3.443">Obviously having a very durable truck</text><text start="397.02" dur="2.1">is super useful of course.</text><text start="399.12" dur="3.741">But bulletproof up to
nine millimeter rounds?</text><text start="402.861" dur="3.417">(Marques thumping truck)</text><text start="412.241" dur="1.939">(sledgehammer thunking)</text><text start="414.18" dur="1.38">Yeah, I&amp;#39;m not gonna test that.</text><text start="415.56" dur="1.74">But you know, there are some
other YouTubers out there</text><text start="417.3" dur="0.99">who totally will.</text><text start="418.29" dur="2.85">And apparently it can
literally stop smaller rounds</text><text start="421.14" dur="1.86">without being punctured.</text><text start="423" dur="2.76">But also, the glass
windows aren&amp;#39;t bulletproof,</text><text start="425.76" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;re more of just
stronger than regular glass.</text><text start="428.37" dur="2.4">And then it&amp;#39;s regular
wheels, regular tires</text><text start="430.77" dur="1.11">that can still get slashed.</text><text start="431.88" dur="1.02">So don&amp;#39;t go getting any ideas</text><text start="432.9" dur="2.13">that this thing is invincible
or anything like that.</text><text start="435.03" dur="4.05">But clearly, cold rolled
stainless steel alloy</text><text start="439.08" dur="2.001">is going to be much stronger</text><text start="441.081" dur="2.289">than the regular outside of the vehicle.</text><text start="443.37" dur="3.03">So that&amp;#39;s the shopping cart in
the back of the parking lot,</text><text start="446.4" dur="1.77">that&amp;#39;s fender benders.</text><text start="448.17" dur="4.05">Or if someone hits you, you&amp;#39;ll be fine.</text><text start="452.22" dur="0.9">You&amp;#39;ll be fine.</text><text start="453.12" dur="0.833">But guess what?</text><text start="453.953" dur="1.627">It also means your truck is now made</text><text start="455.58" dur="2.91">of an extremely fingerprinting material.</text><text start="458.49" dur="1.92">And it also doesn&amp;#39;t
have normal door handles</text><text start="460.41" dur="2.01">so you just cannot keep it clean</text><text start="462.42" dur="1.17">if you use this thing daily.</text><text start="463.59" dur="4.35">And then steel just happens to
be really hard to manipulate.</text><text start="467.94" dur="2.7">Apparently Tesla had to create
new machines strong enough</text><text start="470.64" dur="1.89">to stamp this material together.</text><text start="472.53" dur="1.14">There&amp;#39;s a reason why there aren&amp;#39;t a bunch</text><text start="473.67" dur="1.65">of other cars rolling
around looking like this.</text><text start="475.32" dur="2.28">So when I say in the Auto Focus review</text><text start="477.6" dur="1.65">that low VIN Cybertrucks</text><text start="479.25" dur="2.777">will have low VIN production issues,</text><text start="482.027" dur="2.233">that&amp;#39;s not actually new to Tesla.</text><text start="484.26" dur="2.61">They&amp;#39;ve had to spin up
manufacturing for different types</text><text start="486.87" dur="1.41">of vehicles before,</text><text start="488.28" dur="4.05">and usually the first few
thousand of them aren&amp;#39;t pretty.</text><text start="492.33" dur="1.53">But then they learn from those issues</text><text start="493.86" dur="1.71">and then one or two years down the road</text><text start="495.57" dur="1.68">they&amp;#39;re making millions of the thing</text><text start="497.25" dur="1.74">and they&amp;#39;re much better
quality controlled.</text><text start="498.99" dur="2.03">So this particular Cybertruck</text><text start="501.02" dur="2.05">is the dual motor all-wheel drive.</text><text start="503.07" dur="1.95">This was borrowed from Ridge.</text><text start="505.02" dur="1.05">Shout out to Ridge by the way.</text><text start="506.07" dur="1.47">I&amp;#39;ll leave a link below
if you aren&amp;#39;t caught up</text><text start="507.54" dur="1.02">on my partnership with them.</text><text start="508.56" dur="4.29">But on delivery, this one
had a pretty big panel gap</text><text start="512.85" dur="1.89">on the driver&amp;#39;s side door.</text><text start="514.74" dur="2.49">And you know, I never really
care about panel gaps,</text><text start="517.23" dur="3.9">but this one in particular
actually started growing</text><text start="521.13" dur="1.26">and getting worse.</text><text start="522.39" dur="1.95">It literally looked
like the door was open,</text><text start="524.34" dur="2.16">and then it started making
weird noises while closing.</text><text start="526.5" dur="3.15">Until one day it actually broke.</text><text start="529.65" dur="1.74">So turns out it wasn&amp;#39;t a panel gap,</text><text start="531.39" dur="3.27">it was actually a manufacturing
issue where the bolts</text><text start="534.66" dur="1.92">that hold this latch in place</text><text start="536.58" dur="1.38">were actually not torqued tight enough</text><text start="537.96" dur="2.46">and they loosened over
time and it fell out.</text><text start="540.42" dur="1.92">And so Miles actually had the bright idea</text><text start="542.34" dur="3.03">to just gaffe tape the latch
securely back in place.</text><text start="545.37" dur="4.5">And now when you close the
door, lines up perfectly.</text><text start="549.87" dur="3.06">So Elon Musk addressed this
on Twitter after my video.</text><text start="552.93" dur="3.21">Apparently only 15 trucks had this issue,</text><text start="556.14" dur="1.8">so lucky me, I guess.</text><text start="557.94" dur="1.44">So if you are one of the few,</text><text start="559.38" dur="1.47">then you can apparently just take this</text><text start="560.85" dur="1.08">to a Tesla service center</text><text start="561.93" dur="1.35">and they&amp;#39;ll be able to fix it in no time</text><text start="563.28" dur="1.53">as long as you get an appointment.</text><text start="564.81" dur="2.64">The Cyberbeast that I took
delivery of under my name</text><text start="567.45" dur="2.55">has been flawless so far.</text><text start="570" dur="1.68">But I think the point
I&amp;#39;m trying to make is</text><text start="571.68" dur="3.45">these early Cybertrucks, as
with any other early Tesla,</text><text start="575.13" dur="0.84">they&amp;#39;re going to find,</text><text start="575.97" dur="1.68">I guarantee you, more issues like this.</text><text start="577.65" dur="2.01">And they&amp;#39;ll work on &amp;#39;em and fix &amp;#39;em.</text><text start="579.66" dur="3.42">But yeah, this Foundation
Series badge right here,</text><text start="583.08" dur="1.89">kind of clouted in the Tesla community</text><text start="584.97" dur="3">&amp;#39;cause it basically means
you got one of the first few.</text><text start="587.97" dur="5">But it also kind of means
willing beta tester in a way.</text><text start="593.49" dur="2.31">So you know, these materials
and this new stamping technique</text><text start="595.8" dur="2.07">and all this should
eventually make the vehicles</text><text start="597.87" dur="3.33">much easier to produce
en masse, and cheaper.</text><text start="601.2" dur="2.463">But that&amp;#39;s eventually, eventually.</text><text start="604.56" dur="2.13">All right, next feature, truck stuff.</text><text start="606.69" dur="2.7">I&amp;#39;m talking about the
theoretical reasons why someone</text><text start="609.39" dur="5">would logically buy a truck
over any other vehicle</text><text start="614.43" dur="4.05">like a van or an SUV or a car.</text><text start="618.48" dur="4.83">And that would be for towing,
hauling and off-roading.</text><text start="623.31" dur="3.72">And I know it looks like
this truck would be amazing</text><text start="627.03" dur="2.25">at all of that stuff, but I&amp;#39;m gonna say</text><text start="629.28" dur="3.12">that this one, it&amp;#39;s overrated.</text><text start="632.4" dur="1.47">It&amp;#39;s overrated here,
and I&amp;#39;ll tell you why.</text><text start="633.87" dur="3.36">Now, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, the
Cybertruck, very capable.</text><text start="637.23" dur="3.09">It&amp;#39;s much more capable than
any other Tesla, obviously.</text><text start="640.32" dur="2.94">I can confirm it handles
winter weather really well.</text><text start="643.26" dur="2.49">Like it has heated windshield
wiper and the heated mirrors</text><text start="645.75" dur="2.82">and the door can in fact
open in icy weather.</text><text start="648.57" dur="1.68">They added a wade mode</text><text start="650.25" dur="1.83">that lifts the suspension all the way up</text><text start="652.08" dur="2.31">and pressurizes the battery
so that you can drive</text><text start="654.39" dur="1.89">through really deep water.</text><text start="656.28" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s insane.</text><text start="657.113" dur="1.777">And it also has off-road driving modes</text><text start="658.89" dur="2.31">and towing modes right
here in the settings.</text><text start="661.2" dur="2.88">There&amp;#39;s also only one
wheel and tire option</text><text start="664.08" dur="1.32">right now with Cybertruck.</text><text start="665.4" dur="1.47">Every single Cybertruck ships</text><text start="666.87" dur="5">with the same Goodyear Territory
Wrangler RT Tire, whatever.</text><text start="672.03" dur="1.29">It&amp;#39;s a pretty popular tire</text><text start="673.32" dur="2.31">and they ship them on, you
know, Jeep Grand Cherokees</text><text start="675.63" dur="1.29">and F-150s all the time.</text><text start="676.92" dur="1.32">And it&amp;#39;s reinforced</text><text start="678.24" dur="2.13">and it&amp;#39;s capable of
some light off-roading.</text><text start="680.37" dur="2.01">But I think if we&amp;#39;re being honest,</text><text start="682.38" dur="3.87">most people will be driving
this thing mostly on the street,</text><text start="686.25" dur="1.59">like a glorified SUV.</text><text start="687.84" dur="4.47">So here&amp;#39;s a number to think about, 63.</text><text start="692.31" dur="4.86">63% is the percent of truck
drivers who admit to rarely</text><text start="697.17" dur="3.96">or never towing anything at all.</text><text start="701.13" dur="1.26">And that&amp;#39;s just the ones that admit it.</text><text start="702.39" dur="0.99">Like, look at this chart.</text><text start="703.38" dur="2.43">This is from a survey of F-150 owners,</text><text start="705.81" dur="2.61">so the most popular truck in the country.</text><text start="708.42" dur="3.33">People are almost never actually
towing with these things.</text><text start="711.75" dur="0.9">So before we leave a comment</text><text start="712.65" dur="3.3">that this thing sucks for
towing, yeah, they know, we know.</text><text start="715.95" dur="3.21">Everyone buying it kind
of should already know.</text><text start="719.16" dur="2.31">If you&amp;#39;re buying a truck
specifically for towing,</text><text start="721.47" dur="2.19">then you have a short list
of trucks you&amp;#39;re considering</text><text start="723.66" dur="1.59">and none of them are electric.</text><text start="725.25" dur="1.95">But I think my main
realization with this thing</text><text start="727.2" dur="2.73">is there are millions of preorders
for this thing right now.</text><text start="729.93" dur="2.67">Because it&amp;#39;s Tesla, it&amp;#39;s
going to be very popular.</text><text start="732.6" dur="3.54">This is gonna be a lot
of people&amp;#39;s first truck</text><text start="736.14" dur="3.33">and it will come with all of
the first truck realizations.</text><text start="739.47" dur="0.833">Like to a lot of people,</text><text start="740.303" dur="3.097">the Cybertruck looks absolutely huge,</text><text start="743.4" dur="2.34">but it&amp;#39;s actually smaller than an F-150.</text><text start="745.74" dur="1.29">And these people, when they get the truck,</text><text start="747.03" dur="2.58">they&amp;#39;ll think they&amp;#39;re invincible
and they can drive off road</text><text start="749.61" dur="2.76">and just go wherever they want
without even thinking about</text><text start="752.37" dur="2.13">strategically going certain routes</text><text start="754.5" dur="1.59">or airing down the tires</text><text start="756.09" dur="2.67">that literally come at
50 PSI from the factory.</text><text start="758.76" dur="1.56">They&amp;#39;re gonna start
getting stuck in all sorts</text><text start="760.32" dur="1.83">of embarrassing situations, which means</text><text start="762.15" dur="1.92">of course then there will
be countless articles</text><text start="764.07" dur="0.833">written about them</text><text start="764.903" dur="1.897">because of course no other truck has ever</text><text start="766.8" dur="1.62">been stuck in the snow before.</text><text start="768.42" dur="1.71">And it&amp;#39;s just, sorry,</text><text start="770.13" dur="1.26">I&amp;#39;m definitely getting ahead of myself.</text><text start="771.39" dur="2.91">But look, we will be using a Cybertruck</text><text start="774.3" dur="2.46">at our video production studio
for a lot of the same reasons</text><text start="776.76" dur="1.53">that we&amp;#39;ve used an R1T.</text><text start="778.29" dur="3.69">It&amp;#39;s got a tow hitch, it&amp;#39;s
spacious, it hauls a lot of gear,</text><text start="781.98" dur="2.25">it&amp;#39;s quick, it&amp;#39;s quiet, it&amp;#39;s great.</text><text start="784.23" dur="2.1">But I think the point
I&amp;#39;m trying to make is</text><text start="786.33" dur="3.33">most of the millions of
people who will end up</text><text start="789.66" dur="3.225">with these Cybertrucks eventually</text><text start="792.885" dur="3.225">are going to use them on the street</text><text start="796.11" dur="2.04">just like a glorified SUV</text><text start="798.15" dur="2.97">just &amp;#39;cause they think
this one looks cool.</text><text start="801.12" dur="0.833">And that&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="804.81" dur="3.72">All right, next category, performance.</text><text start="808.53" dur="2.76">Overrated or underrated?</text><text start="811.29" dur="1.23">Well, you might have
seen this little video</text><text start="812.52" dur="2.07">that Tesla did on their YouTube channel</text><text start="814.59" dur="3.45">racing the Cybertruck
against a Porsche 911</text><text start="818.04" dur="3.78">while towing a 911 and beating that 911.</text><text start="821.82" dur="3.18">And that, that was a very clever video.</text><text start="825" dur="1.2">It&amp;#39;s an ad, of course,</text><text start="826.2" dur="1.29">but it also takes advantage of the fact</text><text start="827.49" dur="2.82">that EVs all have this commoditization</text><text start="830.31" dur="2.55">of this enormous straight
line performance,</text><text start="832.86" dur="1.26">great acceleration.</text><text start="834.12" dur="1.2">Anyone can get it.</text><text start="835.32" dur="4.107">But you know, I&amp;#39;d normally
never compare a pickup truck</text><text start="839.427" dur="2.346">to a sports car, right?</text><text start="842.76" dur="2.223">But well, we&amp;#39;re here.</text><text start="846.013" dur="2.833">(energetic music)</text><text start="854.723" dur="2.833">(music continues)</text><text start="863.46" dur="2.833">(music continues)</text><text start="867.26" dur="5">(car revving)
(truck humming)</text><text start="874.91" dur="3.311">(race signal beeping)</text><text start="878.221" dur="2.5">(car roaring)</text><text start="882.302" dur="2.833">(music continues)</text><text start="890.942" dur="2.833">(music continues)</text><text start="897.521" dur="2.833">(music continues)</text><text start="902.97" dur="3.03">So like most drag races,
this one was just for fun.</text><text start="906" dur="1.59">But while we have some
time at this drag strip,</text><text start="907.59" dur="3.12">we did a bunch of these, we
did back to back to back races.</text><text start="910.71" dur="2.82">And it shed a lot of
light on Tesla&amp;#39;s video</text><text start="913.53" dur="1.29">and on the Cybertruck in general.</text><text start="914.82" dur="2.94">So first of all, EVs are quick, right?</text><text start="917.76" dur="1.14">We&amp;#39;ve known this for years.</text><text start="918.9" dur="3.39">Ludicrous mode, Plaid mode, Beast mode.</text><text start="922.29" dur="1.38">This is not new information.</text><text start="923.67" dur="3.96">But cars with gears can be faster.</text><text start="927.63" dur="2.91">So there&amp;#39;s a difference
between quick and fast.</text><text start="930.54" dur="2.49">So when you go to a real drag
strip with timing equipment</text><text start="933.03" dur="2.85">and all that stuff, you
get one of these after.</text><text start="935.88" dur="0.93">This is a time slip.</text><text start="936.81" dur="1.17">Breaks down in both lanes,</text><text start="937.98" dur="1.86">not just the end of the 1/4 mile</text><text start="939.84" dur="2.07">but multiple points along the race.</text><text start="941.91" dur="2.22">And so I&amp;#39;ve expanded it here.</text><text start="944.13" dur="2.94">So this was the triple
motor Cybertruck&amp;#39;s best run,</text><text start="947.07" dur="1.2">one of the first runs.</text><text start="948.27" dur="2.49">It runs a 10.9 second 1/4 mile,</text><text start="950.76" dur="3.99">which if you don&amp;#39;t know,
is absolutely ridiculous.</text><text start="954.75" dur="2.82">There are bonafide sports cars
that don&amp;#39;t run in the 10s.</text><text start="957.57" dur="2.58">And for a 7,000 pound pickup truck</text><text start="960.15" dur="4.05">to do it on all terrain tires
is just kind of hilarious.</text><text start="964.2" dur="1.59">But when you actually
look at and break down</text><text start="965.79" dur="2.76">each of these times,
this shows the difference</text><text start="968.55" dur="2.37">between quick and fast.</text><text start="970.92" dur="1.74">So first of all, off the launch,</text><text start="972.66" dur="1.41">just from zero miles an hour,</text><text start="974.07" dur="1.8">the Cyberbeast with its triple motors</text><text start="975.87" dur="2.25">and with its 1000 hertz traction control</text><text start="978.12" dur="3.96">managing slip at the rear
wheels basically in real time</text><text start="982.08" dur="2.01">is able to explode off the line</text><text start="984.09" dur="1.95">through the first 60 feet of the race</text><text start="986.04" dur="2.4">faster than the 911 Turbo S,</text><text start="988.44" dur="1.92">one of the fastest-launching
cars ever made.</text><text start="990.36" dur="2.01">Now from there, it holds that lead,</text><text start="992.37" dur="2.07">continues putting down all of this power</text><text start="994.44" dur="2.4">all the way out to 330 feet.</text><text start="996.84" dur="1.38">So you can see that at 330 feet,</text><text start="998.22" dur="2.94">4.4 versus 4.5, it&amp;#39;s still out ahead.</text><text start="1001.16" dur="2.1">But by the time you get to 660 feet,</text><text start="1003.26" dur="2.52">which is roughly halfway through the race,</text><text start="1005.78" dur="3.27">that&amp;#39;s when the 911
has changed gears twice</text><text start="1009.05" dur="1.41">and continues to pull.</text><text start="1010.46" dur="1.68">And this is when it shifts</text><text start="1012.14" dur="2.76">and passes the truck around
halfway through the race.</text><text start="1014.9" dur="1.29">Physics just takes over,</text><text start="1016.19" dur="2.94">and the lighter car with many
more gears continues to shift.</text><text start="1019.13" dur="1.44">It passes the truck.</text><text start="1020.57" dur="1.89">Crazy enough, the Cybertruck hits</text><text start="1022.46" dur="3.33">its 114 mile an hour
electronically limited top speed,</text><text start="1025.79" dur="1.44">probably &amp;#39;cause of the tires,</text><text start="1027.23" dur="1.77">well before the end of the 1/4 mile,</text><text start="1029" dur="2.73">while my child, I mean the car,</text><text start="1031.73" dur="2.52">continues to pull into the 140s.</text><text start="1034.25" dur="1.05">No, it&amp;#39;s not stock.</text><text start="1035.3" dur="2.61">Now Tesla made this video
that I&amp;#39;ve talked about,</text><text start="1037.91" dur="2.55">and they wanted to showcase the Cyberbeast</text><text start="1040.46" dur="1.53">against a Porsche 911.</text><text start="1041.99" dur="1.26">And they know all of this</text><text start="1043.25" dur="3.78">so they had to get clever, I&amp;#39;ll say.</text><text start="1047.03" dur="1.86">So if you haven&amp;#39;t seen
it, I&amp;#39;ll link it below.</text><text start="1048.89" dur="2.7">Their video shows the Cybertruck
pulling up to the line.</text><text start="1051.59" dur="1.92">It&amp;#39;s racing a Porsche 911.</text><text start="1053.51" dur="1.89">It beats the 911 in a drag race</text><text start="1055.4" dur="0.833">and then it&amp;#39;s revealed</text><text start="1056.233" dur="2.227">that it was towing a 911 the whole time.</text><text start="1058.46" dur="3.09">So they&amp;#39;re saying you can
beat one while towing one.</text><text start="1061.55" dur="1.5">And then it flashes the 1/4 mile time</text><text start="1063.05" dur="1.62">on the screen, 11 seconds.</text><text start="1064.67" dur="3.36">So first of all, there&amp;#39;s
about 50 different models</text><text start="1068.03" dur="1.98">and variations of the Porsche 911.</text><text start="1070.01" dur="1.65">So just based on what we saw</text><text start="1071.66" dur="2.01">and from the performance in
the video, I&amp;#39;m gonna guess</text><text start="1073.67" dur="1.56">that they went with the cheapest</text><text start="1075.23" dur="1.37">and slowest possible 911.</text><text start="1076.6" dur="2.17">So that would be the 911 Carrera T.</text><text start="1078.77" dur="1.41">It&amp;#39;s a manual transmission.</text><text start="1080.18" dur="2.46">It does zero to 60 in around 4.3 seconds.</text><text start="1082.64" dur="3.21">So now the Cybertruck with
its 2.6 second zero to 60</text><text start="1085.85" dur="1.14">has a massive advantage.</text><text start="1086.99" dur="2.1">And so they&amp;#39;re able to handicap it</text><text start="1089.09" dur="3.09">by having it tow the
911, like 3,000 pounds.</text><text start="1092.18" dur="1.62">Okay, so then they run the race.</text><text start="1093.8" dur="2.43">And if you watch the
video, they run it out</text><text start="1096.23" dur="2.85">to this yellow mark right here.</text><text start="1099.08" dur="1.14">Which it turns out</text><text start="1100.22" dur="2.7">is actually the halfway
point of the drag strip.</text><text start="1102.92" dur="1.38">So shout out to Engineering Explained</text><text start="1104.3" dur="1.47">for doing the math on this one.</text><text start="1105.77" dur="1.29">I&amp;#39;ll leave the video below.</text><text start="1107.06" dur="3.24">But it turns out the Carrera
T, thanks to its gearbox,</text><text start="1110.3" dur="3.51">is still eventually
faster than a Cybertruck,</text><text start="1113.81" dur="1.92">especially if it&amp;#39;s towing 3,000 pounds,</text><text start="1115.73" dur="1.5">but it&amp;#39;s really an 1/8 mile race</text><text start="1117.23" dur="1.08">that they&amp;#39;re showcasing here,</text><text start="1118.31" dur="2.58">and then they quote the
1/4 mile time at the end</text><text start="1120.89" dur="1.62">as if they ran a 1/4 mile race.</text><text start="1122.51" dur="4.11">But as we&amp;#39;ve learned today, quick, fast.</text><text start="1126.62" dur="1.44">People will point out that difference</text><text start="1128.06" dur="1.14">but I&amp;#39;ll let it slide.</text><text start="1129.2" dur="1.2">It&amp;#39;s just a drag race, it&amp;#39;s fun,</text><text start="1130.4" dur="1.38">it&amp;#39;s not that huge of a deal.</text><text start="1131.78" dur="1.74">But I will say, if you can,</text><text start="1133.52" dur="2.58">from stoplight to
stoplight be just as quick</text><text start="1136.1" dur="3.993">as basically any other car
in a 7,000 pound truck,</text><text start="1140.99" dur="2.67">that&amp;#39;s incredible, that&amp;#39;s
hilarious, that&amp;#39;s really fun.</text><text start="1143.66" dur="1.92">But hopefully, at least now
you understand why I&amp;#39;m saying</text><text start="1145.58" dur="2.04">performance is a bit overrated.</text><text start="1147.62" dur="2.67">It&amp;#39;s more of a one trick
pony in a straight line.</text><text start="1150.29" dur="2.79">Now that one trick is very fun</text><text start="1153.08" dur="1.12">and very appealing to certain people.</text><text start="1154.2" dur="3.02">There are people every day
who pick the F-150 Raptor</text><text start="1157.22" dur="2.46">over the F-150 for stuff like this.</text><text start="1159.68" dur="3.48">But you know, then you get to
a turn and it&amp;#39;s a truck again.</text><text start="1163.16" dur="1.53">But also one more thing
I just wanna highlight,</text><text start="1164.69" dur="4.47">again, in our best run
we got 10.995 seconds</text><text start="1169.16" dur="0.833">in the Cybertruck.</text><text start="1169.993" dur="0.937">Is this the fastest?</text><text start="1170.93" dur="0.99">Is this the world record</text><text start="1171.92" dur="2.61">for fastest Cybertruck 1/4 mile?</text><text start="1174.53" dur="3.18">I haven&amp;#39;t seen any faster,
so lemme know if you do.</text><text start="1177.71" dur="1.89">But shout out to Miles, the driver mod.</text><text start="1179.6" dur="2.103">I think we might have a world record here.</text><text start="1184.22" dur="1.98">All right, the 800 volt architecture</text><text start="1186.2" dur="1.62">and the 48 volt low voltage system,</text><text start="1187.82" dur="1.383">both new to the Cybertruck.</text><text start="1190.49" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;m going underrated, if only
for the fun fact that this,</text><text start="1193.97" dur="4.53">this is technically the lightest
fully electric pickup truck</text><text start="1198.5" dur="1.17">in the world.</text><text start="1199.67" dur="1.89">Which is not the highest bar to clear.</text><text start="1201.56" dur="2.43">But yes, thanks to the lesser wire weight,</text><text start="1203.99" dur="1.83">it is lighter than the Hummer EV.</text><text start="1205.82" dur="2.4">It&amp;#39;s also lighter than
the F-150 Lightning.</text><text start="1208.22" dur="4.14">And it is lighter than the
dramatically smaller Rivian R1T.</text><text start="1212.36" dur="1.35">So that&amp;#39;s an accomplishment.</text><text start="1213.71" dur="2.16">I was also hoping it would charge like,</text><text start="1215.87" dur="1.95">just as fast or faster than other Teslas.</text><text start="1217.82" dur="2.01">But it seems right in line, you know,</text><text start="1219.83" dur="1.98">250 kilowatts out of V3 Superchargers</text><text start="1221.81" dur="2.52">for about the first 1/3 of the curve.</text><text start="1224.33" dur="2.91">You know, it looks like less
as far as miles per hour</text><text start="1227.24" dur="0.96">that you&amp;#39;re adding to the battery,</text><text start="1228.2" dur="2.4">but that&amp;#39;s including driving efficiency.</text><text start="1230.6" dur="3.45">Which is, thanks to the
aerodynamics of a refrigerator,</text><text start="1234.05" dur="0.833">not great.</text><text start="1234.883" dur="0.833">Now I also wanna give a shout out</text><text start="1235.716" dur="1.724">specifically to the suspension,</text><text start="1237.44" dur="1.68">just the suspension on the Cybertruck,</text><text start="1239.12" dur="1.44">which I think is underrated.</text><text start="1240.56" dur="2.13">First of all, there&amp;#39;s
a huge amount of travel</text><text start="1242.69" dur="2.04">between the lowest and firmest</text><text start="1244.73" dur="2.04">and the highest and softest settings.</text><text start="1246.77" dur="2.01">And no one&amp;#39;s gonna say this
thing drives like a sports car,</text><text start="1248.78" dur="2.16">but it is pretty impressively low and firm</text><text start="1250.94" dur="1.41">in its lowest setting,</text><text start="1252.35" dur="1.11">and it&amp;#39;s very high,</text><text start="1253.46" dur="1.5">and it can move between those low</text><text start="1254.96" dur="1.95">and high settings really quickly.</text><text start="1256.91" dur="1.41">And I was also very impressed</text><text start="1258.32" dur="3.12">by how little roll and yaw there was.</text><text start="1261.44" dur="1.83">Typically a big truck, you hit accelerate</text><text start="1263.27" dur="1.38">and the nose comes up a lot.</text><text start="1264.65" dur="2.79">This one goes up a little.</text><text start="1267.44" dur="0.833">Not bad.</text><text start="1268.273" dur="1.447">But then also we gotta talk
about, just for a second,</text><text start="1269.72" dur="2.01">Tesla&amp;#39;s minimalism.</text><text start="1271.73" dur="3.33">Because it&amp;#39;s kind of a staple
of Teslas at this point,</text><text start="1275.06" dur="2.46">especially with the Cybertruck
here with the design.</text><text start="1277.52" dur="3.12">But also on the inside and with materials</text><text start="1280.64" dur="1.74">and the choices they make.</text><text start="1282.38" dur="2.07">I think a lot of us would agree</text><text start="1284.45" dur="2.37">that a physical button in a lot of ways</text><text start="1286.82" dur="1.89">is better than a digital button.</text><text start="1288.71" dur="2.25">I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a hot take.</text><text start="1290.96" dur="0.93">But one of the reasons</text><text start="1291.89" dur="1.98">Tesla&amp;#39;s been so successful business wise</text><text start="1293.87" dur="2.55">over the past couple years
in such a competitive market</text><text start="1296.42" dur="1.08">is because they&amp;#39;ve figured out a way</text><text start="1297.5" dur="1.77">to make a profit on every vehicle,</text><text start="1299.27" dur="2.4">and they minimize all of the extra pieces,</text><text start="1301.67" dur="1.26">all of the moving parts.</text><text start="1302.93" dur="1.74">And they&amp;#39;ve gotten rid
of a lot of buttons.</text><text start="1304.67" dur="1.38">Actually, they&amp;#39;ve gotten rid of basically</text><text start="1306.05" dur="2.13">every button in the Cybertruck.</text><text start="1308.18" dur="2.16">But because of Tesla&amp;#39;s success,</text><text start="1310.34" dur="2.94">I feel like auto manufacturers
have started to copy</text><text start="1313.28" dur="1.794">a lot of what Tesla does,</text><text start="1315.074" dur="2.586">to the detriment of
some of their vehicles.</text><text start="1317.66" dur="2.31">I would&amp;#39;ve liked to have
seen in the Cybertruck,</text><text start="1319.97" dur="3.15">this big special vehicle,
maybe a cool key fob</text><text start="1323.12" dur="2.61">that has access to a button
to open the front trunk,</text><text start="1325.73" dur="1.86">or maybe real climate control buttons.</text><text start="1327.59" dur="2.88">Or maybe, we all know they
should have done a mirror</text><text start="1330.47" dur="1.17">that&amp;#39;s actually a screen</text><text start="1331.64" dur="1.35">so you can see out the back of the truck</text><text start="1332.99" dur="1.77">without looking down at the screen.</text><text start="1334.76" dur="1.32">But they didn&amp;#39;t do that.</text><text start="1336.08" dur="4.26">So I&amp;#39;m saying Tesla&amp;#39;s minimalism,
kind of overrated here.</text><text start="1340.34" dur="1.38">But I also do need you to know</text><text start="1341.72" dur="2.79">that despite all the other
interesting technical stuff</text><text start="1344.51" dur="1.92">that I&amp;#39;ve talked about in this video,</text><text start="1346.43" dur="3.03">this is still a Tesla under the hood,</text><text start="1349.46" dur="1.98">and all of the things
that we love about that</text><text start="1351.44" dur="2.13">and all the other stuff
that comes with it.</text><text start="1353.57" dur="1.83">That means it works
with Tesla Superchargers</text><text start="1355.4" dur="1.23">all over the country.</text><text start="1356.63" dur="2.04">That also means it has a super heavy</text><text start="1358.67" dur="2.76">123 kilowatt-hour battery in the floor.</text><text start="1361.43" dur="2.19">It means that the quiet
interior of the vehicle</text><text start="1363.62" dur="2.43">makes the speaker system sound way better</text><text start="1366.05" dur="1.2">than it probably should.</text><text start="1367.25" dur="1.5">And it also means a bunch of things</text><text start="1368.75" dur="2.73">are missing about these early
trucks as they deliver them.</text><text start="1371.48" dur="2.67">The super heavy additional
range extender battery</text><text start="1374.15" dur="1.65">in the back isn&amp;#39;t shipping yet,</text><text start="1375.8" dur="1.53">and nobody knows when it will.</text><text start="1377.33" dur="2.64">The screen also has no
CarPlay or Android Auto,</text><text start="1379.97" dur="3.75">but the software is really
good and super fast.</text><text start="1383.72" dur="2.52">But there&amp;#39;s also no Autopilot right now,</text><text start="1386.24" dur="1.26">even if you paid for it.</text><text start="1387.5" dur="2.4">No light bar right now,
even if you paid for it.</text><text start="1389.9" dur="2.79">No aero caps right now,
and you did pay for those.</text><text start="1392.69" dur="2.37">The locking differential at
the rear axle doesn&amp;#39;t work</text><text start="1395.06" dur="2.04">in the dual motor version
of this truck yet.</text><text start="1397.1" dur="2.76">And there&amp;#39;s only one
tire option, for a truck!</text><text start="1399.86" dur="2.37">All of these are
decisions that Tesla makes</text><text start="1402.23" dur="3.45">knowing the priorities
of the probable buyers,</text><text start="1405.68" dur="2.46">the millions of pre-orders
of the Cybertruck.</text><text start="1408.14" dur="2.79">They know what people are
probably going to do with these.</text><text start="1410.93" dur="2.4">They know what people think
they&amp;#39;re going to do with these.</text><text start="1413.33" dur="1.47">And they know what people want</text><text start="1414.8" dur="1.89">when they buy one of these things.</text><text start="1416.69" dur="1.26">It&amp;#39;s a Tesla under the hood.</text><text start="1417.95" dur="1.53">So I was driving to the
studio the other day,</text><text start="1419.48" dur="2.7">and on my way there I&amp;#39;m
coming up over this hill,</text><text start="1422.18" dur="1.44">and on the other side of the hill</text><text start="1423.62" dur="2.28">is this biker across the street.</text><text start="1425.9" dur="1.71">And as I came over the hill, he looked up</text><text start="1427.61" dur="2.19">and he saw the truck
for about two seconds.</text><text start="1429.8" dur="2.475">And then he reached out
and he just did this</text><text start="1432.275" dur="2.625">as he biked past me.</text><text start="1434.9" dur="1.65">But later that same night,</text><text start="1436.55" dur="1.65">I was on my way home from practice</text><text start="1438.2" dur="2.52">around the bridge somewhere
in New York City at night.</text><text start="1440.72" dur="1.92">And slowing down in traffic,</text><text start="1442.64" dur="2.46">this car pulls up next to
me, kind of in front of me</text><text start="1445.1" dur="2.16">and all four of the windows roll down</text><text start="1447.26" dur="2.64">and these super happy faces all stick out</text><text start="1449.9" dur="2.19">and just like, give me thumbs up</text><text start="1452.09" dur="1.8">and they&amp;#39;re grinning the entire time.</text><text start="1453.89" dur="3.15">And I&amp;#39;d say that&amp;#39;s about the ratio of joy</text><text start="1457.04" dur="1.47">to absolute disgust</text><text start="1458.51" dur="1.47">that you bring into the world</text><text start="1459.98" dur="2.67">driving the Cybertruck around,
it&amp;#39;s probably like 80-20.</text><text start="1462.65" dur="2.88">So what&amp;#39;s the verdict with
the Cybertruck, right?</text><text start="1465.53" dur="3.15">I think there&amp;#39;s a lot going
on between those four corners,</text><text start="1468.68" dur="3.75">a lot of interesting choices
and materials and technologies</text><text start="1472.43" dur="3.69">and steer by wire and 800 volt
systems and all this stuff.</text><text start="1476.12" dur="5">But a lot of it frankly is
overshadowed by the design again.</text><text start="1481.19" dur="1.77">So we keep coming back to the design.</text><text start="1482.96" dur="4.323">And I feel like we can use
that word again, iconic.</text><text start="1488.27" dur="1.26">I would say as a product person,</text><text start="1489.53" dur="4.11">I do think this is
already an iconic design.</text><text start="1493.64" dur="1.92">Now, that comes with a lot of baggage.</text><text start="1495.56" dur="1.59">I feel like when you say that word,</text><text start="1497.15" dur="2.07">it&amp;#39;s kind of like joining the rare air</text><text start="1499.22" dur="4.32">of like, the bedroom poster
of some on some kid&amp;#39;s wall.</text><text start="1503.54" dur="3.96">It&amp;#39;s like the Lamborghini
Countach or the Bugatti Veyron</text><text start="1507.5" dur="2.46">or something like a Tesla Cybertruck.</text><text start="1509.96" dur="3.091">But the thing about those iconic cars</text><text start="1513.051" dur="3.992">is they&amp;#39;re also almost always rare.</text><text start="1517.91" dur="2.13">And that&amp;#39;s the thing, it&amp;#39;s like
if you saw a Bugatti Veyron</text><text start="1520.04" dur="2.46">on the street, that&amp;#39;s probably
the only Bugatti Veyron</text><text start="1522.5" dur="1.98">you&amp;#39;re gonna see on the
street for a long time.</text><text start="1524.48" dur="2.67">There&amp;#39;s not that many
Lamborghini Countaches</text><text start="1527.15" dur="0.84">out on the world.</text><text start="1527.99" dur="3.36">Now the Cybertruck today is super rare.</text><text start="1531.35" dur="1.62">And there&amp;#39;s all these
articles about, you know,</text><text start="1532.97" dur="1.59">celebrities driving them around.</text><text start="1534.56" dur="2.19">And when you see one, it&amp;#39;s an event.</text><text start="1536.75" dur="1.95">That&amp;#39;s why people are
reacting the way they are.</text><text start="1538.7" dur="1.89">It&amp;#39;s probably because it&amp;#39;s the first time</text><text start="1540.59" dur="1.35">they&amp;#39;re ever seeing one.</text><text start="1541.94" dur="4.8">But the Cybertruck is
slotted to be mass produced.</text><text start="1546.74" dur="3.48">So I feel like this actually
has to wear off after a while.</text><text start="1550.22" dur="1.47">Like obviously it hits different</text><text start="1551.69" dur="1.2">seeing your 10th or 50th</text><text start="1554.125" dur="2.335">or 100th Cybertruck of the day, right?</text><text start="1556.46" dur="1.86">So how does that match up?</text><text start="1558.32" dur="2.85">I think there&amp;#39;s like, two
million plus pre-orders</text><text start="1561.17" dur="1.947">of the Cybertruck, and more coming.</text><text start="1563.117" dur="1.323">There were only ever</text><text start="1564.44" dur="3.51">about 2000 Lamborghini
Countaches ever made.</text><text start="1567.95" dur="3.93">There was less than 500
Bugatti Veyrons ever made.</text><text start="1571.88" dur="2.58">So it&amp;#39;s kinda hard to
find a comp for a vehicle</text><text start="1574.46" dur="3.51">that starts off its life as iconic,</text><text start="1577.97" dur="1.62">but then is mass produced.</text><text start="1579.59" dur="1.29">And there was this really
interesting comment</text><text start="1580.88" dur="2.04">on the Auto Focus video
I made about this truck</text><text start="1582.92" dur="3.78">on owning the PT Cruiser
when it first came out.</text><text start="1586.7" dur="1.86">And I wasn&amp;#39;t really old
enough to remember this,</text><text start="1588.56" dur="1.44">so I&amp;#39;m purely taking their word for it,</text><text start="1590" dur="2.97">but it apparently it was
a crazy enough design</text><text start="1592.97" dur="1.44">that it got a lot of attention</text><text start="1594.41" dur="1.47">when it first started being made.</text><text start="1595.88" dur="2.73">You know, it&amp;#39;s a weird shape,
had some odd material choices</text><text start="1598.61" dur="1.05">and all that.</text><text start="1599.66" dur="4.05">But eventually Chrysler made
over a million PT cruisers.</text><text start="1603.71" dur="4.08">But now we know exactly
how cool the PT Cruiser is.</text><text start="1607.79" dur="1.71">You know, it gets humanized more and more</text><text start="1609.5" dur="1.38">the more you see them on the road.</text><text start="1610.88" dur="2.19">You see them get in accidents</text><text start="1613.07" dur="1.62">and have to maneuver through traffic,</text><text start="1614.69" dur="2.43">and they&amp;#39;re just regular
people and regular cars,</text><text start="1617.12" dur="1.74">and they&amp;#39;re everywhere.</text><text start="1618.86" dur="3.21">And I guess the question
is, is that the arc</text><text start="1622.07" dur="1.38">for the Tesla Cybertruck?</text><text start="1623.45" dur="0.833">Like, we don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="1624.283" dur="2.857">But it has to go from being
this crazy unobtainium</text><text start="1627.14" dur="3.633">that it is right now, to being something.</text><text start="1632.15" dur="1.083">Only time will tell.</text><text start="1634.25" dur="1.56">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="1635.81" dur="1.71">Catch you guys in the next one.</text><text start="1637.52" dur="0.833">Peace.</text><text start="1639.452" dur="2.75">(rhythmic music)</text></transcript>
