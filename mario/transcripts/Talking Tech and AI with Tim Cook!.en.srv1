<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="3.191">(upbeat music)</text><text start="3.191" dur="1.309">- All right, Tim.</text><text start="4.5" dur="0.87">- Great to see you.</text><text start="5.37" dur="1.23">- Thanks for spending the time.</text><text start="6.6" dur="1.11">- Thank you for coming.</text><text start="7.71" dur="2.417">So you had the WWDC keynote today.</text><text start="10.127" dur="0.833">- Yeah.</text><text start="10.96" dur="1.978">- Which was really fun to
watch. It was a whole two hours.</text><text start="12.938" dur="1.582">I wanna zoom all the way out,</text><text start="14.52" dur="3">&amp;#39;cause, obviously, a lot of
talk about AI in general.</text><text start="17.52" dur="0.833">- [Tim] Yeah.</text><text start="18.353" dur="1.837">- And I&amp;#39;m kind of just left wondering</text><text start="20.19" dur="2.33">how Apple defines AI in general,</text><text start="22.52" dur="2.59">because I know, if you
ask a regular person,</text><text start="25.11" dur="2.7">you might hear about
generative AI, chat bots,</text><text start="27.81" dur="0.956">things like that.</text><text start="28.766" dur="0.833">- Yeah.</text><text start="29.599" dur="1.271">- And these are relatively new additions</text><text start="30.87" dur="2.71">to Apple&amp;#39;s AI portfolio.</text><text start="33.58" dur="2.84">How do you look at AI as Apple?</text><text start="36.42" dur="4.431">- Well, we&amp;#39;ve been executing
with AI for a long time.</text><text start="40.851" dur="1.449">- [Marques] Right.</text><text start="42.3" dur="2.64">- It&amp;#39;s at the, you&amp;#39;re wearing a watch.</text><text start="44.94" dur="2.64">It&amp;#39;s at the root of the watch.</text><text start="47.58" dur="2.7">I mean, you think about
things like crash detection,</text><text start="50.28" dur="3.267">fall detection, things like Afib,</text><text start="53.547" dur="1.263">and all of this kind of stuff is</text><text start="54.81" dur="2.16">machine learning at the end of the day,</text><text start="56.97" dur="3.06">and so, but what has
captured people&amp;#39;s imagination</text><text start="60.03" dur="5">is generative AI, and we
see it as the opportunity</text><text start="66.93" dur="3.573">for a whole new curve of technology</text><text start="70.503" dur="4.857">and providing and doing
more things for people,</text><text start="75.36" dur="3.35">providing an assistant for people,</text><text start="78.71" dur="3.22">things that really improve people&amp;#39;s lives.</text><text start="81.93" dur="1.653">So that&amp;#39;s how we see it.</text><text start="85.112" dur="3.784">Obviously, it&amp;#39;s not without downside,</text><text start="88.896" dur="2.724">and so we approach it very thoughtfully.</text><text start="91.62" dur="0.833">- Sure.</text><text start="92.453" dur="5">- And as you heard, we have
always been focused on privacy,</text><text start="97.589" dur="5">and so privacy is a very key
tenet of our thrust into AI.</text><text start="102.63" dur="0.833">- Right.</text><text start="103.463" dur="2.047">It&amp;#39;s been interesting to
watch Apple&amp;#39;s arc with AI.</text><text start="105.51" dur="3.75">&amp;#39;cause I made a whole piece,
not more than about a year ago,</text><text start="109.26" dur="2.569">about how Apple seems to never say AI,</text><text start="111.829" dur="2.351">even though they have
all these neural engines</text><text start="114.18" dur="1.32">and machine learning and things like that.</text><text start="115.5" dur="1.59">- Yeah.</text><text start="117.09" dur="1.92">- And so now we have almost this pivot,</text><text start="119.01" dur="1.71">where now we&amp;#39;re just saying it.</text><text start="120.72" dur="3">We&amp;#39;re actually branding
it Apple Intelligence now.</text><text start="123.72" dur="2.702">I&amp;#39;m curious why that changed now.</text><text start="126.422" dur="3.284">- Well, in the beginning,</text><text start="129.706" dur="3.674">and throughout almost
everything that we always do,</text><text start="133.38" dur="3.21">we always talk about
the benefit to the user,</text><text start="136.59" dur="2.43">and so the benefit to the user is</text><text start="139.02" dur="2.67">crash detection and fall detection,</text><text start="141.69" dur="3.78">not the technology behind the feature.</text><text start="145.47" dur="0.833">- Sure.</text><text start="146.303" dur="4.447">- And so we still view it like that,</text><text start="150.75" dur="1.69">but it became clear</text><text start="153.48" dur="3.927">that people wanted to know our views</text><text start="157.407" dur="2.433">on generative AI in particular.</text><text start="159.84" dur="0.9">- [Marques] Yeah.</text><text start="160.74" dur="2.94">- And so we decided to embrace it</text><text start="163.68" dur="2.4">and called it Apple Intelligence.</text><text start="166.08" dur="1.35">- Okay.</text><text start="167.43" dur="2.88">I have a quote from the Dua
Lipa interview that you did.</text><text start="170.31" dur="0.833">- [Tim] Oh, okay.</text><text start="171.143" dur="0.927">- [Marques] That was great.</text><text start="172.07" dur="1.765">- [Tim] It was fun. She&amp;#39;s fantastic.</text><text start="173.835" dur="2.055">- I loved it. It was great.</text><text start="175.89" dur="2.647">You had a quote that said, about AI,</text><text start="178.537" dur="2.063">&amp;quot;If it can be used for nefarious things,</text><text start="180.6" dur="1.26">we won&amp;#39;t go down that road.&amp;quot;</text><text start="181.86" dur="0.833">- Yeah.</text><text start="182.693" dur="1.447">- And at the time, I assumed that</text><text start="184.14" dur="1.784">that meant generative
AI was off the table,</text><text start="185.924" dur="1.666">&amp;#39;cause of all the things
that we&amp;#39;ve seen about</text><text start="187.59" dur="1.8">what it was potentially capable of</text><text start="189.39" dur="2.121">or things that it might do.</text><text start="191.511" dur="1.569">Has that changed?</text><text start="193.08" dur="2.1">Is that something that was off the table</text><text start="195.18" dur="2.499">and you figured now
you&amp;#39;ve got the right tools</text><text start="197.679" dur="2.181">or the right restrictions</text><text start="199.86" dur="1.89">to make sure that that
all goes super well?</text><text start="201.75" dur="0.833">How do you think about that?</text><text start="202.583" dur="2.167">- Generative AI was never off the table.</text><text start="204.75" dur="5">It was always about pursuing
it in a thoughtful kind of way,</text><text start="209.97" dur="3.12">and so that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve done,</text><text start="213.09" dur="1.83">and we&amp;#39;ve implemented it in ways</text><text start="214.92" dur="5">that are less likely to create issues.</text><text start="220.74" dur="1.11">- How so?</text><text start="221.85" dur="0.833">- How so?</text><text start="222.683" dur="2.137">Well, things that, if you think about</text><text start="224.82" dur="1.71">the kinds of things that we talked about,</text><text start="226.53" dur="3.041">we talked about personal context</text><text start="229.571" dur="5">and we talked about privacy,
and so we are not waiting for</text><text start="234.614" dur="5">a comprehensive privacy
legislation regulation</text><text start="239.842" dur="2.198">to come into effect.</text><text start="242.04" dur="2.76">We already view privacy as
a fundamental human right,</text><text start="244.8" dur="4.173">and so that&amp;#39;s the lens that we see it at,</text><text start="249.944" dur="3.66">and given that we&amp;#39;re doing those things,</text><text start="253.604" dur="2.776">personal context and privacy,</text><text start="256.38" dur="3.21">we wanted to integrate it at a deep level,</text><text start="259.59" dur="2.317">so you&amp;#39;re not having to think,</text><text start="261.907" dur="2.273">&amp;quot;Oh, well, now I want to do something</text><text start="264.18" dur="1.98">that uses Intelligence.&amp;quot;</text><text start="266.16" dur="2.25">We put it into the apps
that you&amp;#39;re already using.</text><text start="268.41" dur="0.833">- Right.</text><text start="269.243" dur="1.267">- And integrate it in deeply.</text><text start="270.51" dur="1.02">- Right. Yeah.</text><text start="271.53" dur="2.46">I think also, now, there&amp;#39;s
a lot of talk about it now</text><text start="273.99" dur="1.5">that there is generative AI.</text><text start="275.49" dur="1.38">- [Tim] Yeah.</text><text start="276.87" dur="1.47">- A lot of people have, I mean,</text><text start="278.34" dur="2.73">Apple&amp;#39;s notorious for never
sending anything to the cloud.</text><text start="281.07" dur="1.05">Everything&amp;#39;s on device,</text><text start="282.12" dur="2.64">because that is the most
secure way to do it,</text><text start="284.76" dur="1.59">and was applauded for it.</text><text start="286.35" dur="1.8">Interestingly, this is a
little bit different now.</text><text start="288.15" dur="3.1">With a lot of these larger
models, more complex requests,</text><text start="291.25" dur="1.85">you actually do have to
go off of the device,</text><text start="293.1" dur="2.01">so you&amp;#39;ve developed, I
wanna get the name right.</text><text start="295.11" dur="2.25">Private Cloud Compute.
- Private Cloud Compute.</text><text start="297.36" dur="0.84">- Explain this to us,</text><text start="298.2" dur="2.22">because I think the
general chatter online is,</text><text start="300.42" dur="3.66">well, they have to be sending
data to OpenAI, for example,</text><text start="304.08" dur="2.7">to get a request back from ChatGPT.</text><text start="306.78" dur="1.5">- Well, there&amp;#39;s Private Cloud Compute,</text><text start="308.28" dur="4.62">and then there&amp;#39;s the
arrangement with OpenAI.</text><text start="312.9" dur="1.47">These two things are different.</text><text start="314.37" dur="0.833">- Okay.</text><text start="315.203" dur="3.543">- And so if you look at
Private Cloud Compute,</text><text start="318.746" dur="5">we&amp;#39;re utilizing the same
silicon, or not the same silicon,</text><text start="323.876" dur="4.174">but the same basic architecture
as the silicon that&amp;#39;s in-</text><text start="328.05" dur="0.833">- [Marques] Right.</text><text start="328.883" dur="1.597">- Well, that&amp;#39;s in the iPhone.</text><text start="330.48" dur="1.626">- 15. Yeah, right.</text><text start="332.106" dur="3.834">- And we&amp;#39;re using the same software,</text><text start="335.94" dur="3.685">and so we believe that
we&amp;#39;ve done it in such a way</text><text start="339.625" dur="3.535">that it&amp;#39;s as safe and secure and private</text><text start="343.16" dur="4.57">in the Private Cloud
Compute as the device,</text><text start="347.73" dur="4.5">and so we really worked on this a lot</text><text start="352.23" dur="3.963">and put a lot of wood behind
that arrow to ensure that.</text><text start="357.819" dur="1.671">If you&amp;#39;re working on something</text><text start="359.49" dur="4.763">that requires world knowledge,
so you&amp;#39;re out of the domain</text><text start="365.7" dur="2.7">of personal context and so forth.</text><text start="368.4" dur="1.05">- Yeah.</text><text start="369.45" dur="1.895">- Then you may want to go</text><text start="371.345" dur="2.485">and use one of the large language models</text><text start="373.83" dur="1.29">that are on the market,</text><text start="375.12" dur="3.49">and we selected what
we feel is the best one</text><text start="378.61" dur="3.694">with OpenAI and ChatGPT,</text><text start="382.304" dur="3.076">but you&amp;#39;ll make a conscious
decision to do that</text><text start="385.38" dur="0.833">- Every time.</text><text start="386.213" dur="0.833">- Every time.</text><text start="387.046" dur="0.833">- So you can guarantee</text><text start="387.879" dur="2.211">that there will never be
any data sent to OpenAI</text><text start="390.09" dur="1.59">without your explicit user-</text><text start="391.68" dur="2.1">- That&amp;#39;s right. That&amp;#39;s right.</text><text start="393.78" dur="0.833">You decide.</text><text start="394.613" dur="0.967">- Right.</text><text start="395.58" dur="2.82">I also feel like there
was this blip on the radar</text><text start="398.4" dur="4.178">of stand-alone AI devices, which
I found really interesting.</text><text start="402.578" dur="2.002">They didn&amp;#39;t land too well.</text><text start="404.58" dur="1.62">I think smartphones are pretty great,</text><text start="406.2" dur="2.1">but there was an interesting
conversation around that,</text><text start="408.3" dur="1.92">about using your phone less,</text><text start="410.22" dur="2.31">maybe having AI help you out in ways</text><text start="412.53" dur="2.07">that let you spend less
time on the screen,</text><text start="414.6" dur="1.38">and this is something you echoed also</text><text start="415.98" dur="0.96">in the Dua Lipa interview.</text><text start="416.94" dur="1.35">Like, if you&amp;#39;re looking at your phone</text><text start="418.29" dur="2.04">more than you&amp;#39;re looking
at someone else&amp;#39;s eyes,</text><text start="420.33" dur="1.14">something&amp;#39;s off there.</text><text start="421.47" dur="0.833">- Yeah.</text><text start="422.303" dur="0.833">- Do you think there&amp;#39;s a potential future</text><text start="423.136" dur="1.154">where we&amp;#39;re using our phones less</text><text start="424.29" dur="3.179">because of how well
the Intelligence works?</text><text start="427.469" dur="4.411">- I think it&amp;#39;s a possibility
and a significant possibility.</text><text start="431.88" dur="3.42">I mean, for us, we&amp;#39;ve never
been motivated for people</text><text start="435.3" dur="3.235">to spend their lives on their devices.</text><text start="438.535" dur="5">Our model is not one that
needs engagement to succeed.</text><text start="445.325" dur="3.115">Our model is one where
we want to empower you</text><text start="448.44" dur="3.007">to be able to do things
you couldn&amp;#39;t do otherwise.</text><text start="451.447" dur="4.901">We want to give you a tool so
you can do incredible things</text><text start="456.348" dur="3.372">that you couldn&amp;#39;t do without the tool.</text><text start="459.72" dur="1.95">That&amp;#39;s what motivates us,</text><text start="461.67" dur="3.84">and so, you know, we
come out with things like</text><text start="465.51" dur="4.671">Screen Time, et cetera,
so it&amp;#39;s a bit in your face</text><text start="470.181" dur="2.259">as to how much you&amp;#39;re using your device.</text><text start="472.44" dur="0.833">- True.</text><text start="474.12" dur="3.69">- We come out with, we count
your notifications and so forth</text><text start="477.81" dur="2.317">so that you can go in and say,</text><text start="480.127" dur="2.724">&amp;quot;Do I really want this
many notifications?&amp;quot;</text><text start="482.851" dur="4.736">And we have focus kinds of states</text><text start="487.587" dur="3.813">where you can silence
the phone, et cetera,</text><text start="491.4" dur="2.946">and so I do believe that,</text><text start="494.346" dur="4.914">as things get smarter and
smarter with Apple Intelligence,</text><text start="499.26" dur="5">that you can even take things
that were taking more time</text><text start="505.35" dur="1.83">will take less time now.</text><text start="507.18" dur="0.833">- Right.</text><text start="508.013" dur="3.247">- And so I do think
that opportunity exists.</text><text start="511.26" dur="0.9">- Interesting.</text><text start="512.16" dur="2.16">Yeah. It&amp;#39;s a curious future.</text><text start="514.32" dur="1.14">- It is.</text><text start="515.46" dur="5">It is, and I think I&amp;#39;m
really optimistic about it.</text><text start="521.436" dur="1.494">- Yeah.</text><text start="522.93" dur="2.16">I also feel like there was tons of chatter</text><text start="525.09" dur="2.7">when you were first CEO of Apple,</text><text start="527.79" dur="3.57">about this new shift, obviously,
coming from Steve Jobs,</text><text start="531.36" dur="3.63">and you&amp;#39;ve been CEO for what
feels like a long time now,</text><text start="534.99" dur="1.86">and we&amp;#39;re entering this new age of AI,</text><text start="536.85" dur="1.5">and I&amp;#39;m curious now.</text><text start="538.35" dur="1.05">Now, there&amp;#39;s new chatter about</text><text start="539.4" dur="1.29">who the next CEO is gonna be.</text><text start="540.69" dur="5">What do you feel like your
legacy as CEO at Apple should be?</text><text start="545.82" dur="1.73">- Yeah, Marques, I don&amp;#39;t think about it.</text><text start="547.55" dur="0.833">- Okay.</text><text start="548.383" dur="4.447">- And so, to me, a legacy is
something that is defined by</text><text start="554.197" dur="2.66">other people looking at you,</text><text start="556.857" dur="3.445">not something that you define yourself.</text><text start="560.302" dur="1.088">- Very fair.</text><text start="561.39" dur="2.01">- And so,</text><text start="563.4" dur="4.199">and I typically am always
focused on the forward,</text><text start="567.599" dur="2.641">not the rear-view mirror,</text><text start="570.24" dur="3.78">and that is a characteristic
of Apple in general,</text><text start="574.02" dur="2.071">is we&amp;#39;re very focused on the forward.</text><text start="576.091" dur="3.059">You won&amp;#39;t find a museum here,</text><text start="579.15" dur="2.19">and yet we would have lots of things</text><text start="581.34" dur="3.33">that you might like to
see and reminisce about,</text><text start="584.67" dur="1.08">but we just don&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="585.75" dur="2.16">It&amp;#39;s just not a part of our culture.</text><text start="587.91" dur="0.833">- [Marques] Yeah.</text><text start="588.743" dur="2.825">- And so I feel the same way personally.</text><text start="591.568" dur="3.875">At some point, there will be another CEO,</text><text start="598.62" dur="3.528">and my whole focus in life</text><text start="602.148" dur="3.492">will be on making them successful.</text><text start="605.64" dur="1.29">- Yeah. I like that answer.</text><text start="606.93" dur="1.05">It&amp;#39;s a very LeBron answer.</text><text start="607.98" dur="0.833">I feel like he said something-</text><text start="608.813" dur="0.833">- Oh, is that right?</text><text start="609.646" dur="0.833">- Yeah.</text><text start="610.479" dur="1.701">All right. I wanna end with a little game.</text><text start="612.18" dur="1.14">I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve seen these,</text><text start="613.32" dur="2.29">where it&amp;#39;s a blind ranking.</text><text start="615.61" dur="1.4">Have you seen what these are?</text><text start="617.01" dur="0.84">- A blind ranking?</text><text start="617.85" dur="0.833">- A blind ranking.</text><text start="618.683" dur="3.367">So we&amp;#39;re gonna do a top five
Apple products of all time,</text><text start="622.05" dur="1.5">but I&amp;#39;m gonna give you them one at a time,</text><text start="623.55" dur="1.35">and you don&amp;#39;t know what
the rest of them are.</text><text start="624.9" dur="1.2">So you have to rank the first one</text><text start="626.1" dur="2.65">without knowing what two,
three, four, and five are.</text><text start="628.75" dur="1.007">- Oh.
- Okay.</text><text start="629.757" dur="1.623">- And this is your ranking?</text><text start="631.38" dur="2.31">- This will be your unofficial ranking,</text><text start="633.69" dur="2.28">just based on your gut reaction of</text><text start="635.97" dur="0.833">how you feel about the products.</text><text start="636.803" dur="1.387">- All right, this is a tough one because-</text><text start="638.19" dur="0.833">- It is a tough one.</text><text start="639.023" dur="1.177">- It&amp;#39;s like asking you</text><text start="640.2" dur="4.336">your favorite kids or nephews or nieces.</text><text start="644.536" dur="1.274">- We&amp;#39;ll see how it goes.</text><text start="645.81" dur="0.833">- Yeah.</text><text start="646.643" dur="1.867">Okay, number one. MacBook Air.</text><text start="648.51" dur="1.35">Had that iconic moment of, like,</text><text start="649.86" dur="2.43">taking it out the envelope on stage.</text><text start="652.29" dur="1.988">It&amp;#39;s the most popular laptop
in the world, I think.</text><text start="654.278" dur="2.332">- It&amp;#39;s the most popular in the world,</text><text start="656.61" dur="4.48">and that moment of taking
it out of the folder</text><text start="662.994" dur="3.5">established a characteristic</text><text start="666.494" dur="3.163">about that device that lives today.</text><text start="669.657" dur="4.368">The first one, it wasn&amp;#39;t about
how many people would buy it.</text><text start="674.025" dur="1.083">- [Marques] Yeah.</text><text start="675.108" dur="2.922">- It was about establishing
the foundation.</text><text start="678.03" dur="3.27">- Was that the first Air product?</text><text start="681.3" dur="1.95">- Of any line?</text><text start="683.25" dur="1.68">- Yeah. It might have been.</text><text start="684.93" dur="1.47">- I believe so. Yes.</text><text start="686.4" dur="0.833">- Okay.</text><text start="687.233" dur="0.833">- I believe so,</text><text start="688.066" dur="3.685">and so I&amp;#39;m gonna fail miserably
at giving you a ranking,</text><text start="691.751" dur="1.755">but it was a huge moment.</text><text start="693.506" dur="0.904">- [Marques] Yeah.</text><text start="694.41" dur="2.13">- A huge moment for the company.</text><text start="696.54" dur="1.543">- The iPad.</text><text start="698.083" dur="1.397">- Oh, wow.</text><text start="699.48" dur="3.733">You know, tablets had been in
the market for a long time.</text><text start="703.213" dur="2.28">Our objective is never to be first.</text><text start="705.493" dur="2.117">Our objective is to be best.</text><text start="707.61" dur="1.59">- I remember all the
rumors leading up to it.</text><text start="709.2" dur="2.64">- And there were many
rumors leading up to it,</text><text start="711.84" dur="2.71">and people thought</text><text start="715.92" dur="4.02">many things that weren&amp;#39;t too
nice about it in the beginning,</text><text start="719.94" dur="1.203">including the name,</text><text start="722.481" dur="4.299">and yet I couldn&amp;#39;t live
without my iPad today.</text><text start="726.78" dur="0.884">- [Marques] Yeah.</text><text start="727.664" dur="5">- And so another huge
moment for the company.</text><text start="733.877" dur="3.442">- My number three is the Magic Mouse.</text><text start="737.319" dur="2.214">- The Magic Mouse.</text><text start="742.687" dur="3.446">It was also an incredible moment.</text><text start="747.219" dur="3.771">People don&amp;#39;t think of that as much</text><text start="750.99" dur="2.58">as they would the MacBook Air and the iPad</text><text start="753.57" dur="2.763">and whatever else you&amp;#39;re
going to name probably,</text><text start="757.92" dur="4.677">but getting the ergonomics</text><text start="764.52" dur="1.42">well done</text><text start="767.46" dur="0.909">was key.</text><text start="768.369" dur="1.101">- With the Magic Mouse.</text><text start="769.47" dur="0.833">- [Tim] Yeah.</text><text start="770.303" dur="3.296">- Okay. Four out of five, the iPhone.</text><text start="773.599" dur="3.161">- Oh my God. It changed the world.</text><text start="776.76" dur="0.93">- It definitely changed the world.</text><text start="777.69" dur="1.413">- It changed the world,</text><text start="781.645" dur="4.632">and the simplicity of
defining the three things.</text><text start="787.552" dur="0.833">- [Marques] Yeah.</text><text start="788.385" dur="3.075">- That were on the phone was brilliant</text><text start="791.46" dur="4.05">to get people to think about it like that,</text><text start="795.51" dur="3.3">and, of course, opening up,</text><text start="798.81" dur="2.34">this isn&amp;#39;t talked about as much,</text><text start="801.15" dur="2.279">but, initially, you&amp;#39;ll remember that</text><text start="803.429" dur="1.831">there was not an App Store.</text><text start="805.26" dur="0.833">- Right.</text><text start="806.093" dur="2.467">- The App Store came a year later,</text><text start="808.56" dur="4.219">and that changed everything
in the developer community,</text><text start="812.779" dur="5">because, now, I meet
with students every WWDC,</text><text start="819.21" dur="2.52">and they give me such great inspiration.</text><text start="821.73" dur="2.67">There were no students in
the developer community</text><text start="824.4" dur="2.01">at that particular point in time.</text><text start="826.41" dur="4.53">Now, the developer
population is very diverse</text><text start="830.94" dur="3.33">from an age point of
view and everything else,</text><text start="834.27" dur="4.317">and it just, fundamentally,</text><text start="838.587" dur="3.306">it became an economic miracle for people,</text><text start="844.121" dur="3.922">and got well outside of
just doing it for a hobby.</text><text start="849.57" dur="3.33">You look at all the businesses
that came out of it.</text><text start="852.9" dur="1.53">- Yeah, and now we have WWDC.</text><text start="854.43" dur="1.2">- That&amp;#39;s right.</text><text start="855.63" dur="2.223">- Last but not least, Vision Pro.</text><text start="858.9" dur="0.833">- Oh.</text><text start="862.08" dur="1.26">I love Vision Pro.</text><text start="863.34" dur="5">I was just using it last night
to look at the screening.</text><text start="868.92" dur="1.5">- Yeah. What do you use Vision Pro for?</text><text start="870.42" dur="1.8">I ask everybody who has
one what they use it for.</text><text start="872.22" dur="4.947">- I use it for the entertainment value.</text><text start="877.167" dur="3.631">I use it when I want to do multitasking,</text><text start="880.798" dur="4.022">because I find the multiple windows</text><text start="884.82" dur="2.733">really effective in doing this.</text><text start="888.396" dur="4.314">Of course, I&amp;#39;m reviewing
lots of app on it right now,</text><text start="892.71" dur="2.82">and some of those are enterprise apps,</text><text start="895.53" dur="1.95">some people&amp;#39;s proprietary apps</text><text start="897.48" dur="2.25">that they wanna share with us,</text><text start="899.73" dur="3.833">and I&amp;#39;m seeing an extraordinary number</text><text start="904.564" dur="3.896">and variety of things coming
out of the enterprise area,</text><text start="908.46" dur="3.043">far earlier than we would&amp;#39;ve predicted.</text><text start="911.503" dur="0.917">- Interesting.</text><text start="912.42" dur="3.884">- Because businesses
generally move slow to adopt.</text><text start="916.304" dur="1.021">- [Marques] Yeah.</text><text start="917.325" dur="4.815">- And what we&amp;#39;re seeing is
that half of the Fortune 100</text><text start="922.14" dur="3.66">is now buying Vision Pro for
some project or the other,</text><text start="925.8" dur="1.111">or exploring it.</text><text start="926.911" dur="1.2">- [Marques] Interesting.</text><text start="929.19" dur="4.193">- And so I&amp;#39;m looking at
several of those and, yeah,</text><text start="936.45" dur="3.48">I find that it&amp;#39;s still
an emotional experience</text><text start="939.93" dur="3.747">to look at your photos,
and with visionOS 2,</text><text start="943.677" dur="3.247">being able to take your old photos.</text><text start="946.924" dur="0.866">- [Marques] Yeah.</text><text start="947.79" dur="3.93">- [Tim] And make them 3D, I
think is a big, big thing.</text><text start="951.72" dur="0.833">- [Marques] Yeah.</text><text start="952.553" dur="2.777">- And, you know, I lost both of my parents</text><text start="956.951" dur="5">before Vision Pro came out,
and being able to go back</text><text start="962.919" dur="3.441">and look at those photos differently</text><text start="966.36" dur="3.657">is something that, you know,</text><text start="970.017" dur="2.763">it&amp;#39;s an experience you can&amp;#39;t replicate.</text><text start="972.78" dur="0.853">- For sure.</text><text start="973.633" dur="1.847">Well, we didn&amp;#39;t get a blind ranking,</text><text start="975.48" dur="1.47">but we got a pretty good retrospective.</text><text start="976.95" dur="0.833">- Yeah.</text><text start="977.783" dur="0.937">- Of some of these products.</text><text start="978.72" dur="1.596">Thanks again for your time.
- Thank you.</text><text start="980.316" dur="1.631">- Thank you.
- I&amp;#39;m looking forward to</text><text start="981.947" dur="1.783">when the next feature
drops in the next WW,</text><text start="983.73" dur="0.99">but this was fun.</text><text start="984.72" dur="1.68">Thank you.
- Yeah, it was great fun.</text><text start="986.4" dur="0.976">Thank you for coming.</text><text start="987.376" dur="0.833">- Same.</text><text start="988.209" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
