or what year you&amp;#39;re
talking about,</text><text start="6.338" dur="4.439">the idea of flying cars
always seems to come up</text><text start="10.81" dur="4.238">as cementing
when the future has arrived.</text><text start="16.715" dur="1.936">&lt;i&gt; So, what future
 were we promised,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="18.684" dur="1.635">&lt;i&gt; how far have we gotten,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="20.352" dur="2.837">and how much further up
do we have to go?</text><text start="25.357" dur="2.737">&lt;i&gt; And I&amp;#39;m Marques Brownlee
 and I review dope new tech.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="28.127" dur="2.536">&lt;i&gt; But on this show,
 I&amp;#39;m rewinding the clock&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="30.696" dur="1.602">&lt;i&gt; to look at the tech
 of the past&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="32.331" dur="3.437">&lt;i&gt; that we thought
 would be our future.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="35.801" dur="3.571">&lt;i&gt; This is &amp;quot;Retro Tech:
 Flying Cars.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="39.405" dur="2.236">Hey, what&amp;#39;s up? MKBHD here.</text><text start="41.674" dur="1.668">I know I&amp;#39;m unboxing
something today</text><text start="43.375" dur="1.836">that has something
to do with flying cars,</text><text start="45.244" dur="2.203">that it&amp;#39;s this, uh,
iconic piece of tech</text><text start="47.48" dur="2.269">that apparently
was going to usher us</text><text start="49.782" dur="2.97">into this new era
of personal transportation.</text><text start="52.785" dur="1.802">We&amp;#39;ll see about that.</text><text start="56.155" dur="1.535">This is definitely
the biggest box</text><text start="57.723" dur="1.869">we&amp;#39;ve had on this show.</text><text start="59.625" dur="2.77">There is no indication though
anywhere on this box what it is.</text><text start="64.163" dur="2.67">It&amp;#39;s like a riddle.
What would be a piece of tech</text><text start="66.866" dur="3.437">that would promise
to revolutionize
personal transport,</text><text start="70.336" dur="2.87">but also not fit
in a smaller box than this?</text><text start="73.239" dur="2.536">I&amp;#39;m guessing it&amp;#39;s not
a flying car.</text><text start="75.808" dur="5.739">There is a giant wheel.
Oh, is this the Segway?</text><text start="81.58" dur="3.804">Oh, it&amp;#39;s a Segway.
I know what a Segway is. Okay.</text><text start="85.417" dur="3.304">I cannot wait
to try to ride this.</text><text start="92.158" dur="2.235">It&amp;#39;s really hea--
oh, well, it has to be heavy</text><text start="94.426" dur="2.337">because it&amp;#39;s got
to counterbalance.</text><text start="99.265" dur="3.604">There it is,
the original Segway.</text><text start="102.902" dur="2.369">Is it a flying car? No.</text><text start="105.304" dur="3.838">Is it even a hovercraft? No.
Well, let&amp;#39;s get into it.</text><text start="109.175" dur="3.236">This is the
&amp;quot;Welcome to the evolution</text><text start="112.444" dur="3.004">of personal mobility&amp;quot; pamphlet.</text><text start="115.481" dur="1.935">Lots of warnings.</text><text start="117.449" dur="2.07">&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t roll this over bumps.</text><text start="119.552" dur="2.035">Don&amp;#39;t ride this
over curbs and steps</text><text start="121.62" dur="1.569">and obstacles
and steep slopes</text><text start="123.222" dur="2.169">and slippery surfaces
and loose materials.&amp;quot;</text><text start="125.424" dur="1.135">Whew.</text><text start="126.592" dur="3.771">All right.
Can I get a helmet?</text><text start="130.396" dur="3.47">Okay, I&amp;#39;m going
to be the expert.</text><text start="133.899" dur="2.503">I&amp;#39;m going to put all the swag
that came with it on.</text><text start="138.27" dur="1.402">This is a Segway armband.</text><text start="139.705" dur="2.236">The expert would probably
have this on, right?</text><text start="141.974" dur="2.536">It&amp;#39;s too bad
I&amp;#39;m too swole for this.</text><text start="144.543" dur="2.036">I&amp;#39;ll probably have
to put it on my wrist.</text><text start="146.612" dur="2.67">That is nerdy. Wow.</text><text start="149.315" dur="1.468">I hate to break it
to you, Segway,</text><text start="150.816" dur="2.403">but this is the nerdiest part
of this whole thing.</text><text start="153.252" dur="2.103">There you go.
Let&amp;#39;s fire it up.</text><text start="156.989" dur="1.202">Oh!</text><text start="160.559" dur="2.003">Okay.</text><text start="170.736" dur="2.537">I&amp;#39;m a little dizzy.
I&amp;#39;ll be right back.</text><text start="174.873" dur="1.703">Wow.</text><text start="179.845" dur="1.802">That was fun.</text><text start="181.68" dur="2.97">Is this a flying car? No.</text><text start="184.683" dur="2.17">But this is my segue
into the next segment.</text><text start="193.859" dur="3.604">I&amp;#39;m gonna have you
check underneath your chair.</text><text start="197.496" dur="3.37">( laughs )</text><text start="200.899" dur="2.103">Oh, yeah, it&amp;#39;s my buddy.!</text><text start="203.035" dur="3.404">Oh, guys. It&amp;#39;s the &amp;#39;80s?</text><text start="206.472" dur="1.468">It&amp;#39;s the &amp;#39;80s in a car?</text><text start="207.973" dur="2.57">A DeLorean, a DMC-12,
with Mr. Fusion on the back.</text><text start="210.576" dur="2.436">This is the flying car
that most people think of</text><text start="213.045" dur="1.669">when they think of
a flying car.</text><text start="214.747" dur="1.768">Marques: All right,
I guess let&amp;#39;s walk back</text><text start="216.548" dur="2.437">to, like, the concept
of flying cars in general.</text><text start="219.018" dur="4.605">Why was this such
an obsession for us?</text><text start="223.656" dur="2.035">Negin:&lt;i&gt;
 It&amp;#39;s kind of not surprising
 that Americans&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="225.724" dur="1.636">would be obsessed
with flying cars</text><text start="227.393" dur="1.602">because we&amp;#39;re just
a car culture.</text><text start="229.028" dur="2.736">- ( engine revs )
- ( tires squeal )</text><text start="231.797" dur="1.902">Tim:&lt;i&gt;
 The key to the automotive
 interest in the United States&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="233.732" dur="2.303">has been always
that notion of freedom.</text><text start="236.068" dur="1.802">Announcer:&lt;i&gt;
 Well, the automobile&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="237.903" dur="1.769">&lt;i&gt; has brought with it
 a new way of life.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="239.705" dur="2.97">And that freedom is just key
to the American experience.</text><text start="242.708" dur="1.902">Cars are everything
in America.</text><text start="244.643" dur="2.169">Even though we don&amp;#39;t have
flying cars today,</text><text start="246.845" dur="1.769">it&amp;#39;s not because
we didn&amp;#39;t try.</text><text start="248.647" dur="2.303">Announcer:&lt;i&gt;
 Just an ordinary plane,
 but, wait.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="250.983" dur="3.304">Negin:&lt;i&gt;
 There&amp;#39;s been multiple versions&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="254.32" dur="3.07">&lt;i&gt; of attempts of cars
 that were supposed to fly,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="257.423" dur="3.337">and they crashed.</text><text start="260.793" dur="2.236">Tim:&lt;i&gt; Well, one of
 the earliest flying cars&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="263.062" dur="1.702">&lt;i&gt; that actually looked like
 it had a road to production,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="264.797" dur="2.703">it was called the Aerocar,
way back in the 1940s.</text><text start="267.533" dur="2.469">The Aerocar,
it had the wings in the back</text><text start="270.035" dur="2.97">&lt;i&gt; that could turn it
 into a functioning airplane.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="273.038" dur="3.537">And this 60-mile-an-hour
car takes off.</text><text start="276.608" dur="1.436">Announcer:&lt;i&gt;
 Let&amp;#39;s put traffic woes
 behind us&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="278.077" dur="2.669">&lt;i&gt; and fly
 that wild blue yonder.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="280.779" dur="2.803">Joseph:
Is it a car that can fly,</text><text start="283.615" dur="2.47">or is it just a plane
that can be broken down?</text><text start="286.118" dur="1.936">( imitates explosion )</text><text start="288.087" dur="1.435">Cooler heads prevailed,</text><text start="289.555" dur="2.369">and the Aerocar
didn&amp;#39;t move forward.</text><text start="291.957" dur="1.902">Marques:
Okay, so, there were
actually some attempts</text><text start="293.892" dur="1.869">at flying cars for real.</text><text start="295.794" dur="1.302">But how did science fiction</text><text start="297.129" dur="2.403">impact how we thought
about flying cars?</text><text start="299.565" dur="3.137">Science fiction has really
been obsessed with flying cars--</text><text start="302.735" dur="2.703">&lt;i&gt; movies like &amp;quot;Blade Runner&amp;quot;
 and &amp;quot;Star Wars,&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="305.471" dur="2.069">&lt;i&gt; and of course
 &amp;quot;Back to the Future.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="307.573" dur="4.471">The first time I ever
saw a flying car was
in &amp;quot;The Jetsons.&amp;quot;</text><text start="312.077" dur="3.537"> Joseph:&lt;i&gt; The Jetsons
 have moving sidewalks&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="315.647" dur="1.769">&lt;i&gt; very similar to the ones
 that we see in airports,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="317.449" dur="1.602">&lt;i&gt; television screens
 where they can video chat&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="319.084" dur="1.602">&lt;i&gt; like we do with FaceTime,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="320.719" dur="2.069">&lt;i&gt; and they have flying cars.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="322.821" dur="2.036">So you say to yourself,
&amp;quot;Well, why not flying cars?</text><text start="324.89" dur="1.836">Why can&amp;#39;t I have a flying car
in my garage?&amp;quot;</text><text start="326.759" dur="2.135">Caseen:&lt;i&gt;
 It&amp;#39;s the ultimate fantasy
 for everyone.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="328.927" dur="1.669">But obviously there are
all sorts of challenges</text><text start="330.629" dur="3.137">to making that happen
in real life.</text><text start="333.799" dur="2.269">Marques:&lt;i&gt;
So, science fiction can help us
 imagine the future,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="336.101" dur="1.836">&lt;i&gt; but just envisioning
 a piece of technology&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="337.97" dur="1.769">&lt;i&gt; isn&amp;#39;t enough
 to bring it into being.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="339.772" dur="1.702">&lt;i&gt; No matter
 how compelling the idea&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="341.507" dur="1.568">&lt;i&gt; of a flying car may seem,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="343.108" dur="1.636">&lt;i&gt; the technology
 and the physics&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="344.777" dur="1.835">&lt;i&gt; just doesn&amp;#39;t seem
 to want to play along.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="346.645" dur="2.169">&lt;i&gt; So, today I&amp;#39;m meeting up
with fellow car tech enthusiast&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="348.847" dur="1.802">&lt;i&gt; Gali Russell
 from HyperChange&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="350.682" dur="3.137">&lt;i&gt; to find out just how close--
 er, how far we are&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="353.852" dur="3.204">&lt;i&gt; from this future
 of flying cars.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="357.089" dur="2.036">Marques:
All right, so I guess
the basic challenge</text><text start="359.158" dur="3.337">for a car like this today
to get it to fly</text><text start="362.528" dur="2.269">is to get all the air
underneath it.</text><text start="364.83" dur="2.169">Yeah, it&amp;#39;s a first principles
physics problem</text><text start="367.032" dur="4.004">of literally moving
all of this air super quickly</text><text start="371.069" dur="2.503">&lt;i&gt; with enough force
 to get some sort of lift-off.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="373.605" dur="1.502">Marques:&lt;i&gt;
 Getting all that air
 underneath the car,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="375.14" dur="1.302">that sounds like
a lot of energy.</text><text start="376.475" dur="1.268">To lift it off the ground,</text><text start="377.776" dur="3.07">we would need
1.6 megawatts of power.</text><text start="380.879" dur="1.536">And that just gets you
into the air,</text><text start="382.448" dur="0.968">and then you have
to stay there.</text><text start="383.449" dur="1.401">Yeah.</text><text start="384.883" dur="2.136">Even if we theoretically
solve that problem,</text><text start="387.052" dur="3.471">how are we transferring
the air below the car?</text><text start="390.556" dur="1.969">So, there&amp;#39;s two schools
of thought</text><text start="392.558" dur="2.302">of how we can actually
get enough force at once
to lift this thing.</text><text start="394.893" dur="1.936">&lt;i&gt; You could have some sort
 of propeller system,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="396.862" dur="1.869">-&lt;i&gt; basically like a huge drone. &lt;/i&gt;
-&lt;i&gt; Right.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="398.764" dur="1.735">And then you have
Elon and Tesla working on</text><text start="400.532" dur="2.103">literally repurposing
rocket tech</text><text start="402.668" dur="4.471">&lt;i&gt; with all these kind of
 mini cold gas thrusters
 to get it to lift off.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="407.172" dur="1.869">Okay, so, a system like this,</text><text start="409.074" dur="1.969">if you were to build it
into this car,</text><text start="411.076" dur="1.336">how would it work?
Where would you put it?</text><text start="414.146" dur="2.069">So, this is where
the system would go.</text><text start="416.248" dur="1.869">Okay, so the back seats
are just gone?</text><text start="418.15" dur="1.635">Yeah, we&amp;#39;re pushing
the laws of physics.</text><text start="419.818" dur="2.003">You&amp;#39;d need to use
all the space.</text><text start="421.854" dur="2.202">Marques:&lt;i&gt;
 So, that&amp;#39;s the cold
 compressed air,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="424.089" dur="2.636">&lt;i&gt; the pumps, the thruster,
 everything&amp;#39;s going back here.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="426.758" dur="2.336">- Gali:&lt;i&gt; Yeah. &lt;/i&gt;
-&lt;i&gt; That&amp;#39;s a dramatic
 amount of space&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="429.127" dur="2.937">- to remove from
  the inside of a car.
- Yeah.</text><text start="432.097" dur="2.737">Marques:&lt;i&gt; So, basically,
 to get this nearly 5,000-pound
 car off the ground,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="434.867" dur="3.203">&lt;i&gt; you would need around
 1.6 megawatts of power&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="438.103" dur="2.636">&lt;i&gt; for the car to hover
 with no forward movement.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="440.772" dur="1.803">&lt;i&gt; And this model&amp;#39;s
 100-kilowatt hour battery&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="442.608" dur="1.969">&lt;i&gt; would be able to sustain
 that hovering&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="444.61" dur="1.869">&lt;i&gt; for about 3 to 4 minutes,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="446.512" dur="1.635">&lt;i&gt; as opposed to
 the nearly 400 miles&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="448.18" dur="2.369">&lt;i&gt; you&amp;#39;d be able to travel
 if you stayed on the ground.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="450.582" dur="2.169">&lt;i&gt; And the calculations
 only account for the weight
 of the driver,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="452.784" dur="1.436">&lt;i&gt; so if you want to bring
 your friends along,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="454.253" dur="3.37">&lt;i&gt; your time in the air
 would be even shorter.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="457.656" dur="2.937">All right, so, we&amp;#39;re making
our way into the future.</text><text start="460.626" dur="1.268">The original idea
for flying cars though</text><text start="461.927" dur="2.67">was just, like,
get from point A to point B.</text><text start="464.63" dur="2.603">Maybe there&amp;#39;s better
versions of that future
that aren&amp;#39;t flying.</text><text start="467.266" dur="1.602">The Tesla in some way
embodies that</text><text start="468.901" dur="1.702">&lt;i&gt; because what makes it
 so advanced&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="470.636" dur="1.902">&lt;i&gt; is not that it can fly,
 but it has software.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="472.571" dur="1.302">You know, it can
kind of drive itself.</text><text start="476.708" dur="2.403">I wasn&amp;#39;t around in the &amp;#39;60s,</text><text start="479.144" dur="4.472">&amp;#39;70s, &amp;#39;80s, &amp;#39;90s when
we were imagining flying cars,</text><text start="483.649" dur="2.97">so when I first
was growing up and thinking
about the future of cars,</text><text start="486.652" dur="2.936">&lt;i&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t think
 they should fly.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="489.621" dur="1.168">I thought, &amp;quot;Wow,
they should be more like</text><text start="490.822" dur="1.469">the high-tech stuff
we have today.&amp;quot;</text><text start="492.324" dur="2.803">And now we&amp;#39;re actually kind of
seeing that start to happen.</text><text start="495.16" dur="1.736">&lt;i&gt; Our desire to innovate
 and create&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="496.929" dur="3.036">&lt;i&gt; the next revolutionary
 technology is never-ending.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="499.998" dur="3.638">&lt;i&gt; And so while we may
 still be pretty far away
 from a world of flying cars,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="503.669" dur="2.603">&lt;i&gt; there is another type
 of cutting-edge flying tech&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="506.305" dur="2.703">&lt;i&gt; that we&amp;#39;ve been dreaming
 about for decades.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="509.041" dur="1.702">- Hey!
- I need to borrow your...</text><text start="510.776" dur="2.069">Hover Board?</text><text start="512.878" dur="4.371">Nothing captured the imagination
more than Hover Boards.</text><text start="517.282" dur="2.87">I wanted one.
I know as a kid, that&amp;#39;s
something you could feel</text><text start="520.185" dur="1.102">&lt;i&gt; you could talk your parents
 into buying you.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="521.32" dur="1.868">A DeLorean? Not so much.</text><text start="523.221" dur="1.602">I mean, what&amp;#39;s better
than a skateboard</text><text start="524.856" dur="1.436">than a skateboard that can
lift you off the ground?</text><text start="526.325" dur="1.802">And I remember as a kid</text><text start="528.16" dur="3.771">believing that these things
might actually be real.</text><text start="531.964" dur="3.036">As a joke, Robert Zemeckis,
before the film came out,</text><text start="535.033" dur="3.271">gave an interview and said
that Hover Boards were real.</text><text start="538.337" dur="1.668">Zemeckis:&lt;i&gt;
 They&amp;#39;ve been around
 for years,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="540.038" dur="2.537">&lt;i&gt; it&amp;#39;s just that parents&amp;#39; groups
 have not let&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="542.608" dur="3.37">the toy manufacturers make &amp;#39;em,
and we got our hands on some.</text><text start="546.011" dur="2.102">Tim:&lt;i&gt; Of course,
 it was all made up. It was all

than the Internet.</text><text start="579.111" dur="3.136">It&amp;#39;s finally time

once they removed the handlebars</text><text start="624.156" dur="1.568">&lt;i&gt; and they became

thanks for joining me.</text><text start="691.857" dur="1.301">What is your experience
with hoverboards over the years?</text><text start="693.191" dur="1.936">- Almost none.
- Okay, perfect.</text><text start="695.16" dur="1.969">I guess we just get
into the first one.</text><text start="697.162" dur="2.636">Here it is
under our desk here.</text><text start="699.831" dur="1.636">Uh, this is what--
this is what I&amp;#39;m used to.</text><text start="701.5" dur="2.236">- Right.
- I&amp;#39;m from this era.</text><text start="703.769" dur="1.535">- So, you have experience
  with this.
- I do. </text><text start="705.337" dur="1.402">- Do you?
- No. No.</text><text start="706.772" dur="1.468">Oh, this is gonna be good.</text><text start="708.273" dur="1.735">Marques, I&amp;#39;m 49 years old.</text><text start="710.041" dur="2.437">What this looks like to me
is a stress fracture.</text><text start="712.511" dur="3.77">- Button. Okay.
- ( beeps, chimes )</text><text start="716.314" dur="1.87">So you look
kinda like this.</text><text start="721.119" dur="2.37">Yeah, that is not
superior to walking.</text><text start="723.522" dur="2.502">But you just look
so much cooler.</text><text start="726.057" dur="2.003">This is--
this is already dope.</text><text start="728.093" dur="1.335">I know I&amp;#39;m giving this
a dope already.</text><text start="729.461" dur="1.535">- This is amazing.
- I mean, you do look cool on it</text><text start="731.029" dur="1.402">because you have
a kind of confidence on it</text><text start="732.464" dur="1.535">that I don&amp;#39;t think
I&amp;#39;m gonna possess.</text><text start="734.032" dur="1.368">- ( beeps )
- Oh-- all right.</text><text start="735.433" dur="2.637">Oh, jeez. Oh, come on!</text><text start="738.103" dur="2.202">- Jesus.
- All right, here.</text><text start="740.338" dur="2.17">Oh, my God, I&amp;#39;ve never
felt older in my life.</text><text start="745.911" dur="2.069">- Slowly get your balance.
- Mm-hmm.</text><text start="748.013" dur="3.137">I&amp;#39;m not trying to move.
All right.</text><text start="751.183" dur="2.369">That&amp;#39;s not bad.
There you go.</text><text start="753.585" dur="2.97">- There you go.
- Do I look terrified?</text><text start="756.588" dur="2.236">You look better than if
you were walking that speed.</text><text start="758.857" dur="1.568">- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.</text><text start="760.458" dur="2.637">- You were really good at that.
- I love this thing.</text><text start="763.128" dur="4.405">- I have to give it a dope.
- Much to my dismay,</text><text start="767.566" dur="2.502">I also have to give it a dope</text><text start="770.101" dur="1.335">because I want to
be able to do it.</text><text start="771.469" dur="2.07">All right, dope.
Next up.</text><text start="773.572" dur="2.97">- Oh, jeez.
- Oh, boy.</text><text start="776.575" dur="1.735">I&amp;#39;ve never seen
one of these.</text><text start="778.343" dur="1.569">It&amp;#39;s called the Airwheel.</text><text start="779.945" dur="1.635">To me, it looks
like a Rascal</text><text start="781.613" dur="1.936">that you drive around
in the grocery store,</text><text start="783.582" dur="2.769">except that--
just so much less safe.</text><text start="786.384" dur="2.17">- I&amp;#39;ll try it. Yeah.
- Want to give it a shot?</text><text start="788.587" dur="1.735">- All right,
  so I&amp;#39;m gonna get on.
- You think kickstand out</text><text start="790.355" dur="2.803">- and you just go for it?
- Just...</text><text start="793.191" dur="1.235">- give me a second.
- All right.</text><text start="794.459" dur="2.036">I&amp;#39;m terrified.</text><text start="796.528" dur="2.536">Bailing looks
a lot harder on that.</text><text start="799.097" dur="3.838">- But you look comfortable.
- Yeah, well, I&amp;#39;m sitting.</text><text start="802.968" dur="3.337">Sitting is something that
I feel like I do fairly well.</text><text start="806.338" dur="2.703">I know I look like I&amp;#39;m taking
a ( bleep ) right now.</text><text start="809.074" dur="4.872">When you&amp;#39;re too lazy to walk
and even too lazy to stand,</text><text start="813.979" dur="2.636">this is the gift gizmo for you.</text><text start="816.648" dur="1.602">- You want to try it?
- Yeah.</text><text start="822.354" dur="1.869">You looked much cooler
on the other one.</text><text start="824.256" dur="3.203">Marques: Yeah, this is--
this feels kinda ominous.</text><text start="829.394" dur="3.137">This is a great solution
to a problem nobody had.</text><text start="832.564" dur="3.904">- I&amp;#39;m gonna say
  that&amp;#39;s a nope.
- Nope.</text><text start="836.501" dur="2.536">All right, next up.
Ooh, that&amp;#39;s heavy.</text><text start="839.07" dur="2.47">- Wow.
- Segway Robotics.</text><text start="841.573" dur="3.037">I mean,
I&amp;#39;m sold right here.</text><text start="844.643" dur="2.336">&amp;quot;Robot inside.
The future is coming.&amp;quot;</text><text start="847.012" dur="4.071">Which is pervy. I&amp;#39;m sorry.
That&amp;#39;s perverted.</text><text start="851.116" dur="1.835">It&amp;#39;s got a name. Loomo.</text><text start="852.984" dur="2.203">Open the box from the front.
That&amp;#39;s the front.</text><text start="855.22" dur="2.369">Well, that seems to be
the robot. Out.</text><text start="857.622" dur="1.702">Oh, look at the size of this.</text><text start="859.357" dur="1.969">Here&amp;#39;s the power button.</text><text start="861.359" dur="1.569">( whirring )</text><text start="862.961" dur="1.969">Does it balance itself
and roll around by itself?</text><text start="864.963" dur="3.17">- Seems to.
- I&amp;#39;m gonna get on it
  and see what happens.</text><text start="868.166" dur="1.502">- All right.
- It&amp;#39;s a hoverboard
  in some respects,</text><text start="869.701" dur="2.336">but I&amp;#39;m not even sure
what it does.</text><text start="872.07" dur="1.368">I know my feet go here.</text><text start="873.471" dur="2.103">Much easier to get on
than the other thing.</text><text start="875.607" dur="1.935">- Oh, jeez.
- Oh, my God.</text><text start="877.575" dur="2.337">I mean, it&amp;#39;s cool,
but what is its purpose?</text><text start="879.945" dur="4.071">I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="884.049" dur="1.902">Oh, my God,
there&amp;#39;s a transform button.</text><text start="885.984" dur="2.369">- Michael:
  Oh, it transforms?
- You transform it,</text><text start="888.386" dur="2.871">the head swivels around,
and it&amp;#39;s a robot.</text><text start="892.357" dur="1.702">Michael:
Weird. Okay.</text><text start="894.092" dur="4.138">Loomo personal companion,
follow me.</text><text start="898.263" dur="3.103">Loomo: Here you are.
I will follow you now.</text><text start="901.399" dur="2.169">Please watch out

transportation and it&amp;#39;s
your camera on wheels.</text><text start="917.549" dur="4.004">- Hey, Loomo, follow me.
- I cannot find you.</text><text start="921.586" dur="1.969">- Hey, Loomo, follow me.

I found you.</text><text start="934.165" dur="1.536">I found you. I found you.</text><text start="935.734" dur="2.269">Dang.
That&amp;#39;s locked in right now.</text><text start="938.036" dur="2.97">- Michael: Loomo, sit.
- Loomo, stop following.</text><text start="941.039" dur="2.336">Loomo: I cannot find you.
Please stand in front of me.</text><text start="943.408" dur="1.268">- I cannot find you.
- Loomo.</text><text start="944.709" dur="1.736">Please stand in--

and I hate to say it,</text><text start="958.056" dur="2.369">but there&amp;#39;s just no
good use of it</text><text start="960.458" dur="2.136">and I can&amp;#39;t imagine
it&amp;#39;s cheap.</text><text start="962.627" dur="2.937">- So that&amp;#39;s a nope.
- I agree with your
  entire assessment.</text><text start="965.597" dur="2.603">It&amp;#39;s nope.

 Although we&amp;#39;re not
 quite there yet,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="982.08" dur="2.202">&lt;i&gt; in theory, riding around
 on hoverboards&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="984.315" dur="2.036">&lt;i&gt; is a future

 to that reality,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="990.255" dur="2.436">&lt;i&gt; I&amp;#39;m gonna speak to a duo
 that&amp;#39;s spent the last 10 years&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="992.724" dur="2.603">&lt;i&gt; perfecting their
 hoverboard technology--&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="995.36" dur="4.104">&lt;i&gt; Alexandru Duru
 and Philippe Maalouf
 from Omni Hoverboards.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="999.497" dur="2.77">So, if you were to explain
this hoverboard to me,</text><text start="1002.3" dur="3.437">someone who&amp;#39;s never seen it,
what is it and how does it work?</text><text start="1005.77" dur="2.003">Alexandru:&lt;i&gt;
The hoverboard uses propellers.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1007.806" dur="5.005">&lt;i&gt; The propellers apply force
 on a larger area.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1012.844" dur="2.87">Philippe:&lt;i&gt;
 Using the propellers,
 that&amp;#39;s the challenge.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1015.747" dur="3.604">And to succeed with it, that in
itself was the innovation.</text><text start="1019.384" dur="1.435">Marques:&lt;i&gt;
 The Omni Hoverboard&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1020.852" dur="1.769">&lt;i&gt; has an array of
 10 miniature propellers,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1022.654" dur="1.935">&lt;i&gt; which are powered
 by a bank of batteries&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1024.622" dur="1.702">&lt;i&gt; in the center console
 and a handheld throttle&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1026.357" dur="2.136">&lt;i&gt; that allows the rider
 to control the height,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1028.526" dur="3.137">&lt;i&gt; which can be as high
 as 100 meters.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1031.696" dur="1.969">How do you think
your hoverboard is different</text><text start="1033.698" dur="3.804">from the hoverboards
that people saw</text><text start="1037.535" dur="3.17">in, like, movies and TV that
they might be inspired by?</text><text start="1040.738" dur="3.504">Well, one thing about the movie
&amp;quot;Back to the Future Part II,&amp;quot;</text><text start="1044.275" dur="2.236">&lt;i&gt; it was an extension
 of a skateboard.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1046.544" dur="3.638">&lt;i&gt; And a lot of people wanted
 to create a hoverboard&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1050.215" dur="3.003">&lt;i&gt; that looked visually
 like the one in the movie.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1053.251" dur="2.903">&lt;i&gt; But for us
 to have a hoverboard&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1056.187" dur="2.169">&lt;i&gt; that functions the way
 it does in the movie,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1058.389" dur="2.336">&lt;i&gt; we had to not care
 about how it looks.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1060.758" dur="2.07">&lt;i&gt; It&amp;#39;s all about functionality.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1062.861" dur="2.769">&lt;i&gt; It&amp;#39;s not like
 you&amp;#39;re riding the vehicle.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1065.663" dur="2.003">It&amp;#39;s you yourself
that&amp;#39;s flying.</text><text start="1072.237" dur="1.602">&lt;i&gt; You lean in one direction,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1073.872" dur="2.402">&lt;i&gt; you will go forward
 in that direction.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1076.307" dur="3.371">&lt;i&gt; It&amp;#39;s like a surfboard,
 but you&amp;#39;re surfing the air.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1079.711" dur="2.97">&lt;i&gt; It&amp;#39;s biomechanical.
 It&amp;#39;s an extension
 of your body.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1082.714" dur="2.903">It&amp;#39;s a bit like you
acquired a superpower.</text><text start="1085.65" dur="3.904">I&amp;#39;m sort of picturing,
like, a futuristic field</text><text start="1089.587" dur="2.603">where there&amp;#39;s a bunch of people
all sort of hovering around</text><text start="1092.223" dur="1.535">&lt;i&gt; and going
 through these courses.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1093.791" dur="2.103">&lt;i&gt; It&amp;#39;s a fun world to picture.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1095.927" dur="2.803">Yeah, it&amp;#39;s fun just to fly.
Like, it&amp;#39;s a real trip.</text><text start="1098.763" dur="2.47">I mean, you know,
some people just want to fly it.</text><text start="1101.266" dur="3.604">&lt;i&gt; I think that&amp;#39;s the best part
 of the hoverboard.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1104.903" dur="3.637">&lt;i&gt; The very idea
 that you&amp;#39;re flying,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1108.573" dur="2.87">&lt;i&gt; it&amp;#39;s a classic dream
 of mankind.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1111.476" dur="3.304">I think the hoverboard
could be the beginning
of something.</text><text start="1124.455" dur="1.436">All right, after all that,</text><text start="1125.924" dur="2.502">I guess, uh,
turns out flying cars,</text><text start="1128.459" dur="2.97">aka giving everyone
helicopters,</text><text start="1131.462" dur="3.805">is probably not the best idea.</text><text start="1135.3" dur="1.602">But I still love the idea</text><text start="1136.935" dur="4.504">of recreational
individual flight.</text><text start="1141.472" dur="3.137">Like, I think if you ask
anyone what superpower
they would want to have,</text><text start="1144.642" dur="3.971">a lot of people would say
they would just want to
be able to fly like a bird.</text><text start="1148.646" dur="2.603">So maybe let&amp;#39;s keep
working on that.</text><text start="1151.282" dur="2.103">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="1153.418" dur="2.002">Catch you guys
in the next one. Peace.</text></transcript>
