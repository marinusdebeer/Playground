they had to cut corners on,</text><text start="10.02" dur="1.8">you&amp;#39;ll find the thing
that they trimmed back</text><text start="11.82" dur="2.1">to get it to be a budget phone.</text><text start="13.92" dur="1.77">And so for picking one for
you, it&amp;#39;s just a matter</text><text start="15.69" dur="2.1">of picking the one that
makes the trade offs</text><text start="17.79" dur="0.93">that you&amp;#39;re okay with.</text><text start="18.72" dur="1.08">Like maybe you love,</text><text start="19.8" dur="2.43">you gotta have good build
quality and cameras.</text><text start="22.23" dur="2.22">Well then, iPhone SE is
probably a good one for you.</text><text start="24.45" dur="2.04">And then you know you&amp;#39;re
not gonna get a great screen</text><text start="26.49" dur="1.65">or battery life or things like that.</text><text start="28.14" dur="3.03">Or maybe you gotta have
a great big screen.</text><text start="31.17" dur="1.98">Samsung makes the Galaxy A54.</text><text start="33.15" dur="2.91">Ar maybe you gotta have
good software and cameras.</text><text start="36.06" dur="1.68">Pixel 7A.</text><text start="37.74" dur="4.11">This phone is 350 bucks.</text><text start="41.85" dur="3.629">And this, this is the designer one.</text><text start="45.479" dur="4.25">(sophisticated electro-jazz music)</text><text start="55.386" dur="2.934">(electronic crackling)</text><text start="58.32" dur="2.76">So, this phone is not
going to win anyone over</text><text start="61.08" dur="1.35">with raw specs.</text><text start="62.43" dur="2.73">It&amp;#39;s not gonna win by
having the best camera</text><text start="65.16" dur="2.73">or the best battery life
of any budget phone.</text><text start="67.89" dur="1.89">The performance isn&amp;#39;t gonna
blow you outta the water,</text><text start="69.78" dur="1.89">but you could definitely argue</text><text start="71.67" dur="2.43">that it&amp;#39;s the prettiest $350 phone.</text><text start="74.1" dur="2.1">So Nothing has had this
transparent aesthetic going</text><text start="76.2" dur="1.05">for a while with their phones,</text><text start="77.25" dur="1.23">and then also the earbuds.</text><text start="78.48" dur="2.01">This one definitely also has that.</text><text start="80.49" dur="2.13">There&amp;#39;s also a white version of this.</text><text start="82.62" dur="2.97">I think it looks better, it
also has like black buttons,</text><text start="85.59" dur="1.41">so it&amp;#39;s kinda this nice contrast,</text><text start="87" dur="1.98">but, you know, dark
version looks cool too.</text><text start="88.98" dur="3.21">And honestly if the mission is
to look like a Nothing phone,</text><text start="92.19" dur="1.44">and not be mistaken for anything else,</text><text start="93.63" dur="2.07">then, yeah, mission
definitely accomplished.</text><text start="95.7" dur="2.22">The dual cameras in the
middle and near the top</text><text start="97.92" dur="1.26">is pretty unique.</text><text start="99.18" dur="1.65">Kinda like a pair of eyes maybe.</text><text start="100.83" dur="2.76">And the NFC coil actually
surrounds the cameras.</text><text start="103.59" dur="3.36">Then there are three bars of
LEDs making a glyph design</text><text start="106.95" dur="1.68">around the camera circle again.</text><text start="108.63" dur="2.07">Then it&amp;#39;s kinda this split design,</text><text start="110.7" dur="2.79">the bottom half is like
a PCB-inspired look,</text><text start="113.49" dur="2.58">apparently inspired by the
New York City subway map.</text><text start="116.07" dur="1.23">And Nothing&amp;#39;s already shown people this,</text><text start="117.3" dur="1.95">like there&amp;#39;s been some
reactions to the design already.</text><text start="119.25" dur="2.4">Some people love it, some
people actually hate it.</text><text start="121.65" dur="1.35">I don&amp;#39;t know, it&amp;#39;s a bit asymmetrical,</text><text start="123" dur="2.52">so it&amp;#39;s unconventional for
sure, but I think it&amp;#39;s nice,</text><text start="125.52" dur="0.87">not gonna lie.</text><text start="126.39" dur="2.1">But even if you don&amp;#39;t like
it, at least you can say</text><text start="128.49" dur="2.67">it&amp;#39;s at least somewhat
visually interesting.</text><text start="131.16" dur="2.91">You know, there&amp;#39;s some textures,
there&amp;#39;s some exposed screws</text><text start="134.07" dur="2.19">and some text and that little red square,</text><text start="136.26" dur="2.46">it&amp;#39;s not functional, it&amp;#39;s
just purely to look cool,</text><text start="138.72" dur="1.53">so, I appreciate that.</text><text start="140.25" dur="1.2">And if you do like this look</text><text start="141.45" dur="1.56">but have maybe a more boring phone</text><text start="143.01" dur="1.65">that you&amp;#39;re not willing to give up,</text><text start="144.66" dur="1.23">then channel sponsor dbrand</text><text start="145.89" dur="2.16">has you covered with
their Something skins.</text><text start="148.05" dur="1.23">So if you haven&amp;#39;t heard of it already,</text><text start="149.28" dur="1.8">dbrand has performed some,</text><text start="151.08" dur="1.387">and these are their words, not mine,</text><text start="152.467" dur="3.683">&amp;quot;Creative plagiarism&amp;quot; on
Nothing&amp;#39;s whole design language,</text><text start="156.15" dur="2.04">both in light mode and dark mode,</text><text start="158.19" dur="2.4">so I&amp;#39;ll leave a link below
if you wanna check those out.</text><text start="160.59" dur="0.93">But guess what?</text><text start="161.52" dur="2.01">It&amp;#39;s an extremely
competitive price bracket,</text><text start="163.53" dur="1.38">so you get a good looking phone,</text><text start="164.91" dur="2.73">but you still will have to
make some sacrifices to get it.</text><text start="167.64" dur="4.26">So first of all, it&amp;#39;s clear
plastic, not glass, at the back.</text><text start="171.9" dur="0.833">Which, you know,</text><text start="172.733" dur="1.927">I&amp;#39;m sure Zach will get to
this phone at some point,</text><text start="174.66" dur="3.09">but I think it&amp;#39;ll be easier
to scuff and scratch,</text><text start="177.75" dur="2.76">but harder to shatter,
like glass would be,</text><text start="180.51" dur="1.95">so, but I think it&amp;#39;s a
reasonable trade off.</text><text start="182.46" dur="3.03">It&amp;#39;s also a textured
plastic frame as well,</text><text start="185.49" dur="1.14">so it looks like aluminum,</text><text start="186.63" dur="2.43">but it&amp;#39;s this plastic all
the way around the phone,</text><text start="189.06" dur="2.37">to the point where this phone
actually ends up feeling</text><text start="191.43" dur="2.07">surprisingly light in the
hand for how big it is.</text><text start="193.5" dur="1.47">But we should just get to that,</text><text start="194.97" dur="4.35">this is a huge, it&amp;#39;s a
jumbo-sized phone, it&amp;#39;s gigantic.</text><text start="199.32" dur="1.47">Some people might not love that,</text><text start="200.79" dur="2.22">but I think a lotta people
like really big screens,</text><text start="203.01" dur="1.26">and you get the natural advantages</text><text start="204.27" dur="1.02">that come with a big phone,</text><text start="205.29" dur="2.37">which is a big battery and a big screen.</text><text start="207.66" dur="3.27">So this is a relatively
giant 6.7-inch display</text><text start="210.93" dur="1.2">corner to corner.</text><text start="212.13" dur="2.16">It&amp;#39;s literally ultra phone size.</text><text start="214.29" dur="1.23">And it gets pretty bright too,</text><text start="215.52" dur="1.86">so definitely not flagship bright,</text><text start="217.38" dur="1.71">&amp;#39;cause we have some
crazy numbers these days,</text><text start="219.09" dur="2.07">but 1300 knits peak brightness</text><text start="221.16" dur="2.34">is very visible in bright indoor lighting,</text><text start="223.5" dur="1.65">and bezels are even</text><text start="225.15" dur="1.44">all the way around the front of the phone,</text><text start="226.59" dur="2.76">so, aesthetically, I have no complaints.</text><text start="229.35" dur="2.31">And then even at this price, it&amp;#39;s AMOLED,</text><text start="231.66" dur="2.58">it has an optical fingerprint
reader under the glass.</text><text start="234.24" dur="2.82">Its variable refresh rate up to 120 hertz.</text><text start="237.06" dur="2.97">And it even has 2160 hertz PWM dimming.</text><text start="240.03" dur="1.92">So if you don&amp;#39;t like
the back of this phone,</text><text start="241.95" dur="1.08">at least the front of it,</text><text start="243.03" dur="1.77">that you&amp;#39;re actually
looking at all the time,</text><text start="244.8" dur="1.83">is pretty impressive for 350 bucks.</text><text start="246.63" dur="1.62">But I&amp;#39;d say an even bigger
strength to this phone</text><text start="248.25" dur="1.53">is battery life.</text><text start="249.78" dur="2.91">So battery always comes from
three main things, basically,</text><text start="252.69" dur="2.97">obviously having a huge physical battery.</text><text start="255.66" dur="3.15">Also good software and an efficient chip.</text><text start="258.81" dur="1.26">We&amp;#39;ll get to the software.</text><text start="260.07" dur="2.52">But, this phone has a
5000-milliamp hour battery,</text><text start="262.59" dur="1.11">that&amp;#39;s literally bigger</text><text start="263.7" dur="2.34">than their flagship phones from Nothing,</text><text start="266.04" dur="1.8">so, really big battery.</text><text start="267.84" dur="1.68">It doesn&amp;#39;t have wireless charging,</text><text start="269.52" dur="3.54">but it does have 45-watt wire charging.</text><text start="273.06" dur="2.82">Which is pretty good, that&amp;#39;s
zero to full in an hour.</text><text start="275.88" dur="2.64">And the chip it&amp;#39;s running
is this little thing</text><text start="278.52" dur="4.89">called the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro.</text><text start="283.41" dur="2.46">So, this was my biggest
question mark, actually,</text><text start="285.87" dur="1.5">going into testing this phone,</text><text start="287.37" dur="0.9">&amp;#39;cause, you know how Nothing</text><text start="288.27" dur="2.19">teases the specs and stuff ahead of time.</text><text start="290.46" dur="2.13">So we find out it&amp;#39;s a MediaTek chip,</text><text start="292.59" dur="2.13">and I&amp;#39;m not sure if this
one&amp;#39;s going to perform</text><text start="294.72" dur="1.62">the way I&amp;#39;ve been used
to some other phones,</text><text start="296.34" dur="1.86">like they&amp;#39;re showcasing
all these, you know,</text><text start="298.2" dur="2.28">specifically handpicked
benchmarks results,</text><text start="300.48" dur="2.94">of course they will, but
conveniently, they only compare it</text><text start="303.42" dur="1.86">to a two-year-old Nothing Phone 1</text><text start="305.28" dur="3.24">which had that mid-range,
778G Plus from Qualcomm.</text><text start="308.52" dur="3.9">Now, I&amp;#39;m not expecting
flagship stuff for 350 bucks,</text><text start="312.42" dur="2.43">but like, what&amp;#39;s it gonna land at,</text><text start="314.85" dur="2.25">this feels like a make or
break part of the phone.</text><text start="317.1" dur="1.68">And I&amp;#39;ve been pleasantly surprised.</text><text start="318.78" dur="3">Now, it&amp;#39;s not gonna win
any prizes with raw specs,</text><text start="321.78" dur="2.43">and I definitely don&amp;#39;t think
it&amp;#39;ll earn anybody&amp;#39;s money</text><text start="324.21" dur="1.86">with the benchmark scores alone,</text><text start="326.07" dur="0.93">you look at those numbers,</text><text start="327" dur="2.85">you&amp;#39;re like &amp;quot;Okay, not
a total shock here.&amp;quot;</text><text start="329.85" dur="3.63">But as far as actual performance,
when you use the phone,</text><text start="333.48" dur="1.83">the way I&amp;#39;d put it is, it&amp;#39;s respectable,</text><text start="335.31" dur="2.94">and I really feel like that is
a testament to the software,</text><text start="338.25" dur="1.17">and how well it&amp;#39;s working together.</text><text start="339.42" dur="3.3">So, at this point we&amp;#39;re on Nothing OS 2.5,</text><text start="342.72" dur="1.74">on top of Android 14.</text><text start="344.46" dur="3.06">And you already have seen
Nothing Phone software</text><text start="347.52" dur="2.07">with the dots and the
aesthetic and all that stuff,</text><text start="349.59" dur="3.72">but, it&amp;#39;s clean, there&amp;#39;s no bloat wear,</text><text start="353.31" dur="4.2">and there is a solid
focus on fast and smooth,</text><text start="357.51" dur="2.01">it kinda feels like a throwback</text><text start="359.52" dur="2.73">to the old OnePlus Magic back in the day.</text><text start="362.25" dur="3.06">But with regular use, this phone
is quite smooth and snappy.</text><text start="365.31" dur="2.28">Sometimes a fingerprint
reader shudders a little bit,</text><text start="367.59" dur="1.2">like when you&amp;#39;re first unlocking,</text><text start="368.79" dur="1.05">but for the most part,</text><text start="369.84" dur="2.58">if you&amp;#39;re just using the phone
doing stuff like messaging</text><text start="372.42" dur="3.42">or flipping through a couple
apps, email, web browsing,</text><text start="375.84" dur="3.06">taking your pictures,
this is a smooth phone.</text><text start="378.9" dur="1.41">It&amp;#39;s pretty similar to what they did</text><text start="380.31" dur="2.883">with the Nothing Phone 1, with this 778.</text><text start="384.368" dur="1.072">It&amp;#39;s very solid with everyday use,</text><text start="385.44" dur="2.61">and the second you try to
do super high-end stuff,</text><text start="388.05" dur="1.47">like gaming,</text><text start="389.52" dur="2.25">then you&amp;#39;ll see where the
benchmarks come up short,</text><text start="391.77" dur="1.86">where you start dropping
frames and all that.</text><text start="393.63" dur="3.51">But, again, this is a $350 phone</text><text start="397.14" dur="2.04">and I am definitely not
complaining about that.</text><text start="399.18" dur="1.62">Now Nothing has had some time now</text><text start="400.8" dur="3.36">to build up their aesthetic
and their identity</text><text start="404.16" dur="2.88">and what they really want
a Nothing phone to be.</text><text start="407.04" dur="1.92">And I gotta say, they
have a lot of unique,</text><text start="408.96" dur="2.04">really identifiable things going on here</text><text start="411" dur="2.55">that you may like or dislike,
but they&amp;#39;re all here.</text><text start="413.55" dur="2.46">So aesthetically they&amp;#39;ve
got the dots everywhere.</text><text start="416.01" dur="2.58">So the stock apps have
this dots aesthetic,</text><text start="418.59" dur="1.86">and the thin font to go with it.</text><text start="420.45" dur="3.36">The back arrow in Android
is made of these dots.</text><text start="423.81" dur="2.16">And they have this extensive
built-out selection</text><text start="425.97" dur="1.38">of Nothing widgets now,</text><text start="427.35" dur="1.95">most of them with the dots theme as well,</text><text start="429.3" dur="2.46">so you can have this very
consistent home screen aesthetic.</text><text start="431.76" dur="1.2">And then there&amp;#39;s other little stuff,</text><text start="432.96" dur="2.82">like you can enlarge a single app icon</text><text start="435.78" dur="2.19">to fill up four spots on your home screen</text><text start="437.97" dur="1.83">for a unique home screen grid.</text><text start="439.8" dur="1.44">I don&amp;#39;t know, you might be into that.</text><text start="441.24" dur="2.34">There&amp;#39;s also this nice little animation</text><text start="443.58" dur="1.8">with the folders on the home screen.</text><text start="445.38" dur="2.28">Also this new thing which
lets you add a glass effect</text><text start="447.66" dur="0.99">to your wallpaper,</text><text start="448.65" dur="2.01">so it&amp;#39;s blurred behind your home screen</text><text start="450.66" dur="2.52">for better visibility, I
actually really like that.</text><text start="453.18" dur="1.83">There&amp;#39;s also AI wallpapers now,</text><text start="455.01" dur="2.7">so you can jump into the wallpaper studio</text><text start="457.71" dur="3.42">and create the most soulless combo art</text><text start="461.13" dur="3.15">the world has ever seen
in just a few taps.</text><text start="464.28" dur="3.15">There&amp;#39;s also third-party icon pack support</text><text start="467.43" dur="2.64">on the home screen, with
instant one-touch previews.</text><text start="470.07" dur="2.58">And then of course the glyphs.</text><text start="472.65" dur="2.91">So, this phone still has
some lights on the back,</text><text start="475.56" dur="2.28">it&amp;#39;s less lights that the
flagship, than the phone two,</text><text start="477.84" dur="2.1">but, about the same
amount of functionality.</text><text start="479.94" dur="2.04">So there&amp;#39;s one vertical
light on the right,</text><text start="481.98" dur="1.77">and a small one down
here on the bottom left,</text><text start="483.75" dur="2.97">and then the big top one
arcing around the top left.</text><text start="486.72" dur="3.09">This is the one that works
with the glyph countdown timer.</text><text start="489.81" dur="1.35">Maybe you&amp;#39;ll find that useful.</text><text start="491.16" dur="2.67">The blinking notification
glyph when your phone is down,</text><text start="493.83" dur="2.61">I still wish I could just
customize it a little bit more,</text><text start="496.44" dur="2.79">I know they don&amp;#39;t wanna do
RGB, but if this was RGB,</text><text start="499.23" dur="1.86">I would totally have different colors</text><text start="501.09" dur="1.68">light up for different app notifications</text><text start="502.77" dur="2.22">and I would go to town
with that, but, you know,</text><text start="504.99" dur="1.56">it still works with just white lights.</text><text start="506.55" dur="3.72">And it also does music visualizations</text><text start="510.27" dur="2.91">to sync up with any music
coming out of the speaker,</text><text start="513.18" dur="1.297">so...</text><text start="514.477" dur="3.953">(phone plays electro-R&amp;amp;B music)</text><text start="518.43" dur="0.833">I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="520.92" dur="1.298">Sure.</text><text start="522.218" dur="1.072">Obviously some of this stuff is gimmicks.</text><text start="523.29" dur="2.97">Some of this you may find
useful like once or twice,</text><text start="526.26" dur="2.13">I almost never use the countdown clock,</text><text start="528.39" dur="2.22">but the one time I use
it, it&amp;#39;s kinda cool.</text><text start="530.61" dur="1.89">Side note, I couldn&amp;#39;t
get the glyph composer</text><text start="532.5" dur="1.56">to work at all on this phone.</text><text start="534.06" dur="0.833">The UI worked,</text><text start="534.893" dur="2.137">but it didn&amp;#39;t light up
the lights on the back.</text><text start="537.03" dur="2.43">But you know, on super closeup photos,</text><text start="539.46" dur="3.39">maybe the glyph fill flash
is decently useful sometimes,</text><text start="542.85" dur="1.59">useless other times.</text><text start="544.44" dur="2.4">But hey, while we&amp;#39;re on
the subject, the camera.</text><text start="546.84" dur="3.09">The cameras on the back
here are serviceable,</text><text start="549.93" dur="1.35">like, it&amp;#39;s just practical</text><text start="551.28" dur="1.59">to have cameras on the back of your phone,</text><text start="552.87" dur="3.03">and these, they&amp;#39;re not
good, but, they&amp;#39;re fine.</text><text start="555.9" dur="2.13">I always feel like we go
into budget phone reviews</text><text start="558.03" dur="1.02">kinda knowing, okay,</text><text start="559.05" dur="2.43">this isn&amp;#39;t gonna have
cameras that blow me away,</text><text start="561.48" dur="1.89">it&amp;#39;s not gonna be as
interesting to test these,</text><text start="563.37" dur="2.52">but, you gotta test &amp;#39;em anyway
and see what they&amp;#39;re made of,</text><text start="565.89" dur="1.41">so, this has a different</text><text start="567.3" dur="2.13">new 50-megapixel primary
camera on the back,</text><text start="569.43" dur="2.28">and then it has the same ultra-wide camera</text><text start="571.71" dur="0.99">as the Nothing phone too,</text><text start="572.7" dur="1.86">and actually also the same selfie camera.</text><text start="574.56" dur="2.94">And look, it can take okay pictures.</text><text start="577.5" dur="1.74">Alright, passable pictures.</text><text start="579.24" dur="1.65">I know 50 megapixels is a big number,</text><text start="580.89" dur="1.05">but, here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ll say:</text><text start="581.94" dur="2.07">at this level, even in great lighting,</text><text start="584.01" dur="2.19">the photos aren&amp;#39;t particularly sharp.</text><text start="586.2" dur="3.39">The dynamic range or depth
of field aren&amp;#39;t amazing.</text><text start="589.59" dur="1.65">Like, you&amp;#39;re not buying this phone</text><text start="591.24" dur="2.79">to take the greatest most
artistic photos and videos</text><text start="594.03" dur="1.05">the world has ever seen.</text><text start="595.08" dur="3.12">But, what you do need is
for it to be serviceable,</text><text start="598.2" dur="2.37">to be quick enough for autofocus to work,</text><text start="600.57" dur="3.93">for it to capture a moment,
document scanning, video calls,</text><text start="604.5" dur="1.65">sharing photos with people.</text><text start="606.15" dur="2.49">And it does all that,
and it&amp;#39;s totally fine,</text><text start="608.64" dur="0.93">and I can&amp;#39;t complain.</text><text start="609.57" dur="2.7">And really what&amp;#39;s left a
bigger imprint on me using this</text><text start="612.27" dur="2.64">is that, compared to their
other flagship phones,</text><text start="614.91" dur="3.18">almost all of the features are still here.</text><text start="618.09" dur="1.8">Like the only one I&amp;#39;m not actually seeing</text><text start="619.89" dur="2.52">on this budget version of
the phone is macro mode.</text><text start="622.41" dur="2.7">And that, that theme of
keeping a lotta the stuff</text><text start="625.11" dur="1.26">from the more expensive phones</text><text start="626.37" dur="2.64">and not doing these artificial cuts,</text><text start="629.01" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;s what feels good about
this phone as a budget phone,</text><text start="632.16" dur="2.97">to me, it actually feels like
they&amp;#39;re trying to give people</text><text start="635.13" dur="3.93">all of the Nothing phone
experience for less money.</text><text start="639.06" dur="1.95">Now, we definitely can&amp;#39;t
say it&amp;#39;s one-to-one,</text><text start="641.01" dur="2.07">there&amp;#39;s obviously cuts,
especially with hardware,</text><text start="643.08" dur="1.98">Like there&amp;#39;s no wireless
charging, like I said.</text><text start="645.06" dur="2.7">It&amp;#39;s IP54 instead of IP68.</text><text start="647.76" dur="2.82">It&amp;#39;s plastic instead
of glass and aluminum.</text><text start="650.58" dur="3.42">But, I like that once you
start to get to use the phone,</text><text start="654" dur="3.36">especially with the software
features, experience wise,</text><text start="657.36" dur="2.76">I don&amp;#39;t feel nearly as many
artificial-feeling cuts</text><text start="660.12" dur="1.2">as we&amp;#39;ve seen on other phones.</text><text start="661.32" dur="1.77">Like there&amp;#39;s no pro mode in the camera</text><text start="663.09" dur="2.22">that&amp;#39;s missing from the budget phone.</text><text start="665.31" dur="3.24">All the same advanced settings,
the experimental features,</text><text start="668.55" dur="2.52">all the home screen
features with Nothing OS,</text><text start="671.07" dur="1.89">it&amp;#39;s all here, on this cheaper phone.</text><text start="672.96" dur="1.56">And the crazy part to me is,</text><text start="674.52" dur="2.7">they obviously wanna compare
this to a lower-end phone,</text><text start="677.22" dur="1.59">so they compare it to the Phone 1,</text><text start="678.81" dur="2.647">and my natural instinct is
like, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m ignoring that,</text><text start="681.457" dur="2.273">&amp;quot;of course they&amp;#39;re comparing
it to the old phone.&amp;quot;</text><text start="683.73" dur="2.55">But when, you actually look
at that 2-year-old phone,</text><text start="686.28" dur="2.28">you kinda see how far they&amp;#39;ve come.</text><text start="688.56" dur="1.23">And you look at the things</text><text start="689.79" dur="2.16">that are actually better
about this budget phone.</text><text start="691.95" dur="4.74">This Nothing Phone 2A has
a bigger, brighter screen,</text><text start="696.69" dur="1.41">with thinner bezels.</text><text start="698.1" dur="3.24">It has a larger battery,
with faster charging,</text><text start="701.34" dur="2.04">a higher-processor clock speed,</text><text start="703.38" dur="2.22">a higher-resolution front camera,</text><text start="705.6" dur="3.39">and a wider variety of refresh
rates than the Phone 1.</text><text start="708.99" dur="1.98">Like, no wonder they
wanna show us the Phone 1.</text><text start="710.97" dur="3.36">But, in general, if you&amp;#39;re
looking for the TLDW,</text><text start="714.33" dur="4.92">yes, this is a good, solid,
all-around budget phone.</text><text start="719.25" dur="1.98">And the way Nothing has
been tracking with software,</text><text start="721.23" dur="1.71">it appears, I mean they&amp;#39;re promising</text><text start="722.94" dur="2.16">three years of Android
updates with this phone.</text><text start="725.1" dur="2.07">I think this will be a
good budget phone to own</text><text start="727.17" dur="2.07">for the next couple years.</text><text start="729.24" dur="1.89">Well done, Nothing.</text><text start="731.13" dur="0.833">Well done.</text><text start="732.87" dur="1.29">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="734.16" dur="1.5">Catch you guys in the next one.</text><text start="735.66" dur="0.833">Base.</text></transcript>
