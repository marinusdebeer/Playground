you get any other phone?</text><text start="12.03" dur="2.46">This S 24 Ultra has taken the best things</text><text start="14.49" dur="2.01">from every other ultra high-end phone</text><text start="16.5" dur="2.1">and stuffed them into one place,</text><text start="18.6" dur="2.97">so anything that you could possibly value,</text><text start="21.57" dur="1.5">it has pushed to the max.</text><text start="23.07" dur="2.79">And there&amp;#39;s just multiple cherries on top,</text><text start="25.86" dur="2.1">just sprinkled all over the place.</text><text start="27.96" dur="2.072">This phone sets the tone for 2024.</text><text start="30.032" dur="3">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="41.016" dur="2.334">So the formula for Samsung&amp;#39;s Ultra phones</text><text start="43.35" dur="1.95">has evolved a little bit over the years.</text><text start="45.3" dur="2.28">At first, it was just the most numbers,</text><text start="47.58" dur="3.06">the biggest megapixel count,
the most zoom and all that.</text><text start="50.64" dur="1.41">Then it added the S Pen</text><text start="52.05" dur="3.3">and got a little more refined
and it replaced the Note.</text><text start="55.35" dur="2.82">Now it&amp;#39;s just everything.</text><text start="58.17" dur="1.11">It&amp;#39;s just everything in one place.</text><text start="59.28" dur="1.41">It&amp;#39;s all the best hardware,</text><text start="60.69" dur="3.12">all the best software I can
think of all in one phone.</text><text start="63.81" dur="2.31">So on the outside, like I
said in my early impressions,</text><text start="66.12" dur="3.09">this phone looks almost the
same as last year&amp;#39;s phone,</text><text start="69.21" dur="1.65">but if you think this
phone is almost the same</text><text start="70.86" dur="2.88">as last year&amp;#39;s phone, turns
out you&amp;#39;re missing a lot.</text><text start="73.74" dur="1.44">So the more you use this phone,</text><text start="75.18" dur="1.71">the more you look for weaknesses,</text><text start="76.89" dur="1.41">the more impressive it gets.</text><text start="78.3" dur="0.833">So maybe what?</text><text start="79.133" dur="1.837">You&amp;#39;re a screen snob, right?</text><text start="80.97" dur="1.2">You like to pixel peep,</text><text start="82.17" dur="0.833">maybe you were thinking about</text><text start="83.003" dur="3.187">getting one of the ultra
high-end Oppo or Xiaomi phones</text><text start="86.19" dur="2.82">just for an amazing screen.</text><text start="89.01" dur="2.4">All right, well, look no further.</text><text start="91.41" dur="1.68">Literally one of the best
screens than any phone.</text><text start="93.09" dur="2.85">S24 Ultra has dropped in a class leading</text><text start="95.94" dur="3.48">6.8 inch quad HD AMOLED
display and it is awesome.</text><text start="99.42" dur="3.9">These ultra phones have
had 120Hz LTPO for a while</text><text start="103.32" dur="2.28">and they&amp;#39;ve been this really sharp quad HD</text><text start="105.6" dur="1.02">for a while now too.</text><text start="106.62" dur="1.8">But now on top of that, two new things,</text><text start="108.42" dur="3.51">one is it&amp;#39;s completely flat
and two is its much brighter.</text><text start="111.93" dur="1.8">So there&amp;#39;s been this whole new batch</text><text start="113.73" dur="2.489">of like 2,500 plus nit phones</text><text start="116.219" dur="1.951">in the past couple months that I&amp;#39;ve seen.</text><text start="118.17" dur="3.75">This I think is the best looking
one that I&amp;#39;ve seen so far.</text><text start="121.92" dur="3.21">So now it&amp;#39;s up to a max 2,600 nits,</text><text start="125.13" dur="2.31">which is awesome outdoors or anywhere.</text><text start="127.44" dur="2.16">But it also gets extremely
dim at night too,</text><text start="129.6" dur="1.17">without any of the weird banding</text><text start="130.77" dur="1.11">I&amp;#39;ve seen in some other phones.</text><text start="131.88" dur="1.92">And they flattened the display completely</text><text start="133.8" dur="2.28">and brought the display
right up to the very corners</text><text start="136.08" dur="1.53">with some of the thinnest
bezels we&amp;#39;ve seen</text><text start="137.61" dur="0.833">all the way around.</text><text start="138.443" dur="2.437">Plus there&amp;#39;s also this new
anti-reflective coating</text><text start="140.88" dur="1.41">on this Gorilla Glass Armor</text><text start="142.29" dur="1.53">that makes a noticeable difference</text><text start="143.82" dur="2.64">with certain light hitting
it at off axis angles.</text><text start="146.46" dur="3.33">And then there is a crazy fast
ultrasonic fingerprint reader</text><text start="149.79" dur="1.26">underneath to top it all off.</text><text start="151.05" dur="1.53">And you know, maybe I
wish the touch target</text><text start="152.58" dur="2.16">was a little bit bigger,
but that&amp;#39;s about it.</text><text start="154.74" dur="1.71">Honestly, if you&amp;#39;re a screen snob,</text><text start="156.45" dur="2.16">it doesn&amp;#39;t really get better
than this one right here.</text><text start="158.61" dur="1.68">This is the phone you should get.</text><text start="160.29" dur="2.94">Okay, so what if your primary
concern is battery life?</text><text start="163.23" dur="1.92">Well, you could always
get the Energizer phone</text><text start="165.15" dur="1.32">that we saw at CES at one time,</text><text start="166.47" dur="3.36">but as far as reasonably
sized flagship slab phones go,</text><text start="169.83" dur="1.71">it doesn&amp;#39;t get much better than this.</text><text start="171.54" dur="2.43">Again, they&amp;#39;re keeping a 5,000mAh battery</text><text start="173.97" dur="2.01">in one of the best
performing battery phones</text><text start="175.98" dur="1.08">from the past two years,</text><text start="177.06" dur="2.85">despite making it thinner
and keeping the S Pen.</text><text start="179.91" dur="1.62">So you might as well get this one.</text><text start="181.53" dur="2.1">Still got 45 watt wired charging,</text><text start="183.63" dur="3.03">you still have 25 watt wireless charging</text><text start="186.66" dur="1.59">and just battery life-wise,</text><text start="188.25" dur="2.61">I was able to have long
days with no problems,</text><text start="190.86" dur="1.62">with six hours plus screen on time.</text><text start="192.48" dur="3.6">I was able to baby it into
getting two full days,</text><text start="196.08" dur="5">that&amp;#39;s at 1440p, at 120Hz
and with high brightness use.</text><text start="201.18" dur="2.88">So yeah, Why get anything else?</text><text start="204.06" dur="3.27">So okay, what if then
it&amp;#39;s just performance</text><text start="207.33" dur="2.463">is the main thing that you care about.</text><text start="210.9" dur="1.23">Okay, so we&amp;#39;re seeing all these phones</text><text start="212.13" dur="2.22">with the Snapdragon 8 Gen
3 starting to come out</text><text start="214.35" dur="1.44">and they&amp;#39;re looking really good.</text><text start="215.79" dur="1.32">Great high-end performance,</text><text start="217.11" dur="1.98">there&amp;#39;s efficiency gains
all over the place,</text><text start="219.09" dur="2.76">plus this phone pairs
it with 12 gigs of RAM</text><text start="221.85" dur="1.53">and it is a multitasking champ.</text><text start="223.38" dur="2.13">And if it&amp;#39;s a stylus
you&amp;#39;re into, I already know</text><text start="225.51" dur="2.1">you aren&amp;#39;t really
considering any other phone,</text><text start="227.61" dur="3.15">the S Pen is basically
the only high-end stylus</text><text start="230.76" dur="1.83">still going in slab smartphones.</text><text start="232.59" dur="3.15">It&amp;#39;s really good for note-taking,
drawing, highlighting,</text><text start="235.74" dur="0.833">all that stuff.</text><text start="236.573" dur="1.717">But if you&amp;#39;re like me and
you hardly ever use that,</text><text start="238.29" dur="1.89">there&amp;#39;s still the gaming performance</text><text start="240.18" dur="1.35">and the everyday performance.</text><text start="241.53" dur="1.8">There&amp;#39;s the newly added rate tracing</text><text start="243.33" dur="3.27">plus a 90% larger vapor
chamber to cool the phone</text><text start="246.6" dur="1.08">for much longer stuff.</text><text start="247.68" dur="1.47">Turns out it&amp;#39;s an A plus.</text><text start="249.15" dur="3">Now you could always get a gaming phone</text><text start="252.15" dur="3.63">and squeeze five to 10% more frames</text><text start="255.78" dur="2.28">out of a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</text><text start="258.06" dur="3.09">with some huge badass cooling
setup, and that&amp;#39;s great,</text><text start="261.15" dur="2.88">but then you also have to
accept all of the sacrifices</text><text start="264.03" dur="3.81">that come with said
gaming phone over this.</text><text start="267.84" dur="4.683">And do you really want
those extra frames that bad?</text><text start="273.78" dur="1.32">Depends on who you ask.</text><text start="275.1" dur="2.25">Okay, cameras, there&amp;#39;s a lot
of other phones out there</text><text start="277.35" dur="2.34">that you could buy if your 1,300 bucks</text><text start="279.69" dur="2.52">specifically has to go
to the best cameras.</text><text start="282.21" dur="2.01">You know the Pixel just
won the blind camera test.</text><text start="284.22" dur="1.74">Sony has the best manual mode,</text><text start="285.96" dur="1.56">like there&amp;#39;s other great camera systems.</text><text start="287.52" dur="0.96">But here&amp;#39;s a way to simplify it,</text><text start="288.48" dur="1.95">I think in evaluating smartphone cameras,</text><text start="290.43" dur="3.12">there&amp;#39;s basically two ways to review them.</text><text start="293.55" dur="3.93">There&amp;#39;s the utility, the
actual technical evaluation,</text><text start="297.48" dur="5">and the aesthetics, the art
of it, the subjectivity part.</text><text start="302.73" dur="3.42">And I think utility-wise,
like on paper, specs-wise,</text><text start="306.15" dur="0.9">this camera&amp;#39;s got it all.</text><text start="307.05" dur="1.35">Like you&amp;#39;ve seen this camera array before,</text><text start="308.4" dur="2.16">there&amp;#39;s four cameras on
the back of this phone.</text><text start="310.56" dur="1.8">Turns out, they&amp;#39;re
basically the same cameras</text><text start="312.36" dur="2.49">as last year&amp;#39;s S23 Ultra except for one.</text><text start="314.85" dur="2.7">So there&amp;#39;s a primary camera, an ultra wide</text><text start="317.55" dur="2.13">and a pair of two different
telephoto cameras.</text><text start="319.68" dur="2.52">The primary camera is still the ridiculous</text><text start="322.2" dur="3.33">200 megapixel sensor with
all the same pros and cons.</text><text start="325.53" dur="2.7">It&amp;#39;s consistent and
versatile across the board.</text><text start="328.23" dur="1.65">It has great dynamic range.</text><text start="329.88" dur="2.07">It&amp;#39;s a quick shooter with quick auto focus</text><text start="331.95" dur="2.52">and it&amp;#39;s also always bending
down to 12 megapixels</text><text start="334.47" dur="2.13">and you should almost never switch it</text><text start="336.6" dur="1.8">to the 200 megapixel mode</text><text start="338.4" dur="1.77">unless you have incredible lighting.</text><text start="340.17" dur="0.96">It has an ultra wide</text><text start="341.13" dur="1.56">with a bit of distortion near the edges,</text><text start="342.69" dur="1.74">but it&amp;#39;s actually meaningfully wider</text><text start="344.43" dur="2.43">than the primary camera, so
it&amp;#39;s really fun to shoot with.</text><text start="346.86" dur="2.76">Even though the automatic
macro mode from it</text><text start="349.62" dur="2.46">looks like trash and you
should just turn it off</text><text start="352.08" dur="3.96">anytime it turns your pictures
from this to this, pro tip.</text><text start="356.04" dur="2.7">And then it has a medium
range, 3X telephoto camera</text><text start="358.74" dur="2.97">that kicks in smoothly and
matches the colors and exposure</text><text start="361.71" dur="1.62">from the main camera really well.</text><text start="363.33" dur="2.13">And so the one new thing
in hardware this year</text><text start="365.46" dur="3.78">is they&amp;#39;ve gone from a
10 megapixel, 10X camera</text><text start="369.24" dur="4.05">to a 50 megapixel 5X camera.</text><text start="373.29" dur="3.18">So technically, shorter
optical zoom range,</text><text start="376.47" dur="1.68">but I would say with the extra resolution,</text><text start="378.15" dur="2.31">it is actually more powerful.</text><text start="380.46" dur="3.69">It means all the photos in
the gap between 5X and 10X</text><text start="384.15" dur="1.44">look sharper than last year.</text><text start="385.59" dur="2.7">And then you can literally put
the 10X photos side by side</text><text start="388.29" dur="2.31">from the S23 Ultra and the S24 Ultra</text><text start="390.6" dur="3.63">and the new 5X cropped
in actually looks better.</text><text start="394.23" dur="1.59">Plus you can still zoom all the way in</text><text start="395.82" dur="2.4">and shoot at a 100X if
you still wanna take</text><text start="398.22" dur="4.77">ultra stable pictures of far
away objects like the moon.</text><text start="402.99" dur="2.46">But basically what I&amp;#39;m
saying is utility-wise,</text><text start="405.45" dur="2.61">this camera system
checks every single box.</text><text start="408.06" dur="1.2">It has everything.</text><text start="409.26" dur="1.23">So from there</text><text start="410.49" dur="4.74">you get into the more
subjective aesthetic differences</text><text start="415.23" dur="2.88">which you could always
lean one way or the other.</text><text start="418.11" dur="1.8">I think, I mean, looking at these photos,</text><text start="419.91" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;re still very much Samsung&amp;#39;s</text><text start="422.73" dur="2.4">slightly extra process-looking,</text><text start="425.13" dur="2.73">a little bit extra contrasty,
a little bit higher exposure,</text><text start="427.86" dur="1.17">a little brighter colors,</text><text start="429.03" dur="1.56">that still happens with these photos.</text><text start="430.59" dur="1.47">So you could still convince yourself</text><text start="432.06" dur="3.36">to lean Pixel or even iPhone,</text><text start="435.42" dur="3.69">but if you just wanna be able
to check every single box,</text><text start="439.11" dur="1.17">why look anywhere else?</text><text start="440.28" dur="1.68">Honestly, the changes that you notice more</text><text start="441.96" dur="1.71">aside from the actual camera quality</text><text start="443.67" dur="1.59">are just like features using it.</text><text start="445.26" dur="3">Like the S24 Ultra shoots
everything HDR by default now,</text><text start="448.26" dur="2.76">it&amp;#39;s actually in Google&amp;#39;s
new ultra HDR format.</text><text start="451.02" dur="2.07">So when you have specular highlights</text><text start="453.09" dur="2.49">or big dynamic range
differences in a photo,</text><text start="455.58" dur="3.12">it will tastefully crank up that stuff</text><text start="458.7" dur="2.97">for a more dramatic looking
picture on the phone screen,</text><text start="461.67" dur="2.13">similar to what Pixel
and iPhone already do.</text><text start="463.8" dur="3.36">And this passes through all the
way from capturing the photo</text><text start="467.16" dur="3">to viewing it in the gallery,
and then one more step,</text><text start="470.16" dur="2.1">to actually publishing it on social media.</text><text start="472.26" dur="3.48">So Samsung has worked with
Instagram and Snapchat</text><text start="475.74" dur="3.12">for native quality photo and
video uploading pipelines</text><text start="478.86" dur="1.68">because at the end of the
day, once you take the photo,</text><text start="480.54" dur="3.81">what are you 99% of the
time planning to do with it?</text><text start="484.35" dur="0.833">Share it.</text><text start="485.183" dur="2.047">And I think this is important
for a lot of people,</text><text start="487.23" dur="4.56">one of the reasons I have
carried an iPhone for years</text><text start="491.79" dur="1.38">is one of the things
you can always count on</text><text start="493.17" dur="2.94">is the photos and videos
in third party apps</text><text start="496.11" dur="1.14">are going to look just as good</text><text start="497.25" dur="2.28">as if they were captured
in the main camera.</text><text start="499.53" dur="2.58">And now you can actually
say that that is true now</text><text start="502.11" dur="3.36">about photos and videos from this phone,</text><text start="505.47" dur="2.58">at least in Instagram and Snapchat.</text><text start="508.05" dur="2.49">All right, maybe you&amp;#39;re a software person,</text><text start="510.54" dur="2.64">maybe the top of your list
when buying a new smartphone</text><text start="513.18" dur="2.28">is you want the smartest smartphone.</text><text start="515.46" dur="3.72">It&amp;#39;s gotta have all the
software and AI features.</text><text start="519.18" dur="3.03">And honestly, it should have a
nice long roadmap ahead of it</text><text start="522.21" dur="2.94">of on-time software updates,</text><text start="525.15" dur="2.19">sounds like I&amp;#39;m describing a Pixel</text><text start="527.34" dur="3.39">but turns out, this phone now has a ton,</text><text start="530.73" dur="3.51">a ton of helpful AI features built-in</text><text start="534.24" dur="0.87">that are actually good,</text><text start="535.11" dur="1.77">they make a meaningful
difference to everyday use.</text><text start="536.88" dur="1.23">Now the funny part about a lot of this</text><text start="538.11" dur="2.19">is a lot of these features are made</text><text start="540.3" dur="3.21">in partnership with Google, as you&amp;#39;ll see.</text><text start="543.51" dur="1.41">And I can&amp;#39;t help but keep thinking</text><text start="544.92" dur="3.39">like it feels like Samsung needs Google</text><text start="548.31" dur="2.46">to have all of these
features in their phone</text><text start="550.77" dur="2.49">to compete especially against the iPhone.</text><text start="553.26" dur="1.29">But then Google,</text><text start="554.55" dur="2.94">now their own phones are a
little bit less competitive,</text><text start="557.49" dur="2.1">but it&amp;#39;s probably worth the trade off</text><text start="559.59" dur="2.1">because now technically
they&amp;#39;re helping to compete</text><text start="561.69" dur="0.99">against the iPhone.</text><text start="562.68" dur="1.5">It&amp;#39;s this weird like thing
where they need each other.</text><text start="564.18" dur="1.56">I think it&amp;#39;s fascinating</text><text start="565.74" dur="1.89">and probably worth its own separate video,</text><text start="567.63" dur="1.11">maybe let me know with a comment</text><text start="568.74" dur="2.55">or by subscribing if
you&amp;#39;d be down to see that.</text><text start="571.29" dur="1.83">But that&amp;#39;s all the
background, all of this.</text><text start="573.12" dur="2.04">So we were just talking
about photos a second ago,</text><text start="575.16" dur="1.8">the second you&amp;#39;re done taking a photo</text><text start="576.96" dur="1.92">and opening it up in
Samsung&amp;#39;s Gallery app,</text><text start="578.88" dur="2.07">there&amp;#39;s a ton of useful AI driven stuff</text><text start="580.95" dur="0.84">that you can do with it.</text><text start="581.79" dur="2.25">And it&amp;#39;s kinda all based
on what sort of scene</text><text start="584.04" dur="1.65">it auto detects that you&amp;#39;ve taken.</text><text start="585.69" dur="2.85">So lots of photos just end
up with a remaster button</text><text start="588.54" dur="2.07">where you click it and then
it can add some contrast</text><text start="590.61" dur="1.62">and brighten things up
a little bit as needed</text><text start="592.23" dur="2.01">and gives you a solid before and after.</text><text start="594.24" dur="3.39">But if your photo has
some glass or a window,</text><text start="597.63" dur="2.55">it&amp;#39;ll show you an Erase Reflections button</text><text start="600.18" dur="1.17">and then you can literally go in</text><text start="601.35" dur="1.98">and circle the reflections
you wanna get rid of</text><text start="603.33" dur="1.47">and it&amp;#39;ll generative fill</text><text start="604.8" dur="2.13">what should actually be in the glass.</text><text start="606.93" dur="1.02">And it works pretty well.</text><text start="607.95" dur="2.34">Now with this photo, I didn&amp;#39;t
take it in portrait mode</text><text start="610.29" dur="1.83">but it&amp;#39;s recognized that there&amp;#39;s a subject</text><text start="612.12" dur="2.52">and so it&amp;#39;ll offer to add background blur.</text><text start="614.64" dur="1.83">And even without a bunch
of extra depth information,</text><text start="616.47" dur="2.7">it analyzes the subject and
it lets me add a little bit</text><text start="619.17" dur="1.62">or a lot of background blur</text><text start="620.79" dur="2.88">with a pretty good cutout, if you ask me,</text><text start="623.67" dur="2.04">to just create a portrait
mode shot out of thin air.</text><text start="625.71" dur="2.49">But if you ever really,
really wanna go crazy,</text><text start="628.2" dur="2.43">there&amp;#39;s a whole separate Magic Editor</text><text start="630.63" dur="3.57">that feels exactly like what
we just got with the Pixel</text><text start="634.2" dur="1.489">minus any restrictions,</text><text start="635.689" dur="2.531">it&amp;#39;s never told me it can&amp;#39;t do something.</text><text start="638.22" dur="2.31">So you open any photo,
hit that Edit button,</text><text start="640.53" dur="0.84">and then there&amp;#39;s this little</text><text start="641.37" dur="2.07">blue green button with the stars,</text><text start="643.44" dur="2.34">that&amp;#39;s Samsung&amp;#39;s new Magic Editor.</text><text start="645.78" dur="2.82">And once you&amp;#39;re here,
you can just go nuts.</text><text start="648.6" dur="2.31">You can move the subject around a photo</text><text start="650.91" dur="1.95">and have a generative
fill in the background.</text><text start="652.86" dur="2.34">Or you can have it remove things entirely</text><text start="655.2" dur="2.04">from the foreground or
the background of a photo,</text><text start="657.24" dur="2.49">like photo bombers or just
unnecessary random objects.</text><text start="659.73" dur="1.5">I actually found this super useful.</text><text start="661.23" dur="2.01">But probably actually my
favorite one, underrated,</text><text start="663.24" dur="2.76">you know how normally when
you need to tilt a photo,</text><text start="666" dur="2.67">like fix the horizon,
you end up cropping in</text><text start="668.67" dur="1.95">and losing some of the
outside of the photo?</text><text start="670.62" dur="2.37">You can still do that but
with this Magic Editor,</text><text start="672.99" dur="1.98">you can open it up and tilt the horizon</text><text start="674.97" dur="2.43">to whatever angle you want,
and instead of cropping,</text><text start="677.4" dur="3.63">it will literally generative
fill in the outsides</text><text start="681.03" dur="2.76">of the photo, which works very well</text><text start="683.79" dur="1.41">because usually the outside of the photo</text><text start="685.2" dur="1.56">is the least important part of the photo.</text><text start="686.76" dur="1.56">You can get away with generative fill.</text><text start="688.32" dur="2.37">And by the way, literally all
this stuff works with photos</text><text start="690.69" dur="1.26">you download to the phone too,</text><text start="691.95" dur="2.04">not just photos you&amp;#39;ve
taken on the camera,</text><text start="693.99" dur="3.33">but photos you just get
wherever just like the Pixel.</text><text start="697.32" dur="1.35">Now I also find it hilarious</text><text start="698.67" dur="3.06">that if you use the Magic
Editor to alter a photo</text><text start="701.73" dur="1.74">on this phone, it&amp;#39;ll
add a little watermark</text><text start="703.47" dur="2.22">to the bottom corner
with these little stars</text><text start="705.69" dur="3.48">so that you know that this
photo was AI manipulated,</text><text start="709.17" dur="2.01">which is good, that&amp;#39;s a good
responsible thing to do,</text><text start="711.18" dur="2.1">especially if you&amp;#39;re gonna
upload this to social media.</text><text start="713.28" dur="2.07">But then you can also
immediately erase that watermark</text><text start="715.35" dur="2.28">with a built-in object removal tool</text><text start="717.63" dur="1.44">in Samsung&amp;#39;s Photo Editor app.</text><text start="719.07" dur="1.71">There&amp;#39;s a nice little
section in the settings</text><text start="720.78" dur="3.99">where Samsung&amp;#39;s tucked all of
the AI features of this phone.</text><text start="724.77" dur="1.71">It&amp;#39;s called Advanced Intelligence,</text><text start="726.48" dur="1.56">instead of artificial intelligence.</text><text start="728.04" dur="1.53">Still AI though.</text><text start="729.57" dur="0.96">That&amp;#39;s where you get stuff like</text><text start="730.53" dur="3.36">the live phone call translation feature</text><text start="733.89" dur="1.35">or the new Voice Recorder app</text><text start="735.24" dur="1.71">getting much improved speaker labels</text><text start="736.95" dur="2.16">and summaries and transcriptions.</text><text start="739.11" dur="3.45">The Samsung Browser will now
do summaries of webpages.</text><text start="742.56" dur="1.8">This might all sound very familiar,</text><text start="744.36" dur="3.66">but the best new one in my
opinion is Circle to Search.</text><text start="748.02" dur="3.33">Now Google Lens has been
around for a long time,</text><text start="751.35" dur="2.7">in my opinion, one of Google&amp;#39;s
most underrated products.</text><text start="754.05" dur="1.11">So people might have already known</text><text start="755.16" dur="1.74">that you could basically do this already,</text><text start="756.9" dur="1.8">but it would take several steps.</text><text start="758.7" dur="2.79">Circle to Search, just makes it one step.</text><text start="761.49" dur="2.52">It&amp;#39;s much faster, it&amp;#39;s pretty awesome.</text><text start="764.01" dur="2.43">You literally just hold
down on the home button</text><text start="766.44" dur="2.94">or the gesture bar at the
bottom and then circle or tap</text><text start="769.38" dur="2.13">whatever on your screen
that you wanna Google search</text><text start="771.51" dur="1.56">and it just immediately Googles</text><text start="773.07" dur="1.56">over the top of whatever you were doing</text><text start="774.63" dur="2.16">without leaving that
app and it&amp;#39;s so useful.</text><text start="776.79" dur="2.07">Just, even during the week
I&amp;#39;ve been using this phone,</text><text start="778.86" dur="2.76">I&amp;#39;ve searched pictures,
parts of pictures before,</text><text start="781.62" dur="1.38">it almost always works,</text><text start="783" dur="1.65">just like uploading it to Google Lens.</text><text start="784.65" dur="2.01">I&amp;#39;ve searched objects right in front of me</text><text start="786.66" dur="1.35">through the camera view finder.</text><text start="788.01" dur="1.98">I&amp;#39;ve searched random landmarks.</text><text start="789.99" dur="1.26">You can also search text</text><text start="791.25" dur="3.15">and you can even append
text to your search.</text><text start="794.4" dur="2.04">And I was just constantly
impressed by how fast it is,</text><text start="796.44" dur="2.61">and it basically works as
expected every single time.</text><text start="799.05" dur="4.02">The one fidgety part is
sometimes selecting text</text><text start="803.07" dur="1.41">gets a little weird.</text><text start="804.48" dur="2.28">Using the S Pen can
solve that a little bit</text><text start="806.76" dur="1.35">to just get a more precise selection.</text><text start="808.11" dur="1.23">But yeah, once you do it,</text><text start="809.34" dur="2.52">it&amp;#39;s much faster than if
you&amp;#39;re gonna use Google Lens,</text><text start="811.86" dur="1.38">having to like take a screenshot</text><text start="813.24" dur="1.35">and then upload it through Lens</text><text start="814.59" dur="2.58">and then maybe have to crop
it and the whole thing.</text><text start="817.17" dur="1.59">This is just fast.</text><text start="818.76" dur="2.88">Now real OGs will know that
there used to be a feature</text><text start="821.64" dur="2.76">on Pixels called Now on Tap.</text><text start="824.4" dur="2.28">It was like the same exact
thing, hold the home button</text><text start="826.68" dur="2.19">and it would just Google
whatever was on your screen</text><text start="828.87" dur="2.64">and help you out but that
was everything on your screen</text><text start="831.51" dur="2.22">and they kinda ended up wrapping
that into Google Assistant.</text><text start="833.73" dur="2.28">This is just so much
faster and more selective.</text><text start="836.01" dur="3.66">Also, Pixels are gonna get
this feature very soon as well.</text><text start="839.67" dur="2.31">But then bonus points, if
you really love software,</text><text start="841.98" dur="5">Samsung is now promising seven
years of security updates</text><text start="847.08" dur="4.44">and seven generations of
major software updates</text><text start="851.52" dur="2.67">on this phone, on this S24 lineup.</text><text start="854.19" dur="2.31">I assume seven generations
of software updates</text><text start="856.5" dur="2.16">is basically seven years.</text><text start="858.66" dur="3.93">That means this phone will
be up to date in 2031.</text><text start="862.59" dur="0.833">Loving that.</text><text start="863.423" dur="3.007">So we know the common wisdom
was that if you wanted four,</text><text start="866.43" dur="2.19">five, six plus years of software updates</text><text start="868.62" dur="2.79">or if you want every single
little software and AI feature,</text><text start="871.41" dur="3.72">you basically had to go iPhone or Pixel.</text><text start="875.13" dur="3.45">But now that this phone also has that,</text><text start="878.58" dur="1.65">why get anything else?</text><text start="880.23" dur="2.13">But speaking of the iPhone,
they&amp;#39;re going at them too.</text><text start="882.36" dur="1.207">Now I know I said in the
beginning of this video,</text><text start="883.567" dur="5">$1,300 slab Android phone, so
I know the iPhone 15 Pro Max</text><text start="888.87" dur="3.12">was never really on the table,
but if we&amp;#39;re being honest,</text><text start="891.99" dur="3.09">Samsung has never been shy
about competing directly</text><text start="895.08" dur="1.38">against the iPhone,</text><text start="896.46" dur="3.66">so why not take some of the
best stuff from there too?</text><text start="900.12" dur="1.08">They weren&amp;#39;t being subtle about it.</text><text start="901.2" dur="3.48">So they&amp;#39;ve got this shiny
brand new titanium color</text><text start="904.68" dur="3.27">with titanium rails on the S24
Ultra, just like the iPhone.</text><text start="907.95" dur="1.95">They have flatten the screen and the sides</text><text start="909.9" dur="2.4">and made boxier corners all
the way through the lineup,</text><text start="912.3" dur="0.96">just like the iPhone.</text><text start="913.26" dur="3.03">They have moved to a max 5X telephoto lens</text><text start="916.29" dur="2.04">like I talked about earlier,
also just like the iPhone.</text><text start="918.33" dur="1.86">They also have this new always on display</text><text start="920.19" dur="1.23">that doesn&amp;#39;t just show the time</text><text start="921.42" dur="1.68">but shows your whole wallpaper now,</text><text start="923.1" dur="2.22">kinda like it&amp;#39;s half awake
just like the iPhone.</text><text start="925.32" dur="1.32">Thankfully, you can also turn that off</text><text start="926.64" dur="2.04">and save some battery,
just like the iPhone.</text><text start="928.68" dur="3.66">You can also now long press
to select an object in a photo</text><text start="932.34" dur="2.67">that automatically cuts it
out and makes it a sticker</text><text start="935.01" dur="2.07">you can use in other apps,
just like the iPhone.</text><text start="937.08" dur="2.73">And there&amp;#39;s even these new
lock screen widgets now</text><text start="939.81" dur="3.57">that look exactly like the iPhones,</text><text start="943.38" dur="1.2">like copy my homework</text><text start="944.58" dur="2.16">but don&amp;#39;t even worry if
they know you copied it.</text><text start="946.74" dur="1.8">These two are gonna
keep copying each other</text><text start="948.54" dur="2.37">till the end of time, none
of this is a surprise,</text><text start="950.91" dur="2.61">it&amp;#39;s just at the end of the
day we are technically winning</text><text start="953.52" dur="1.53">because they&amp;#39;re making each other</text><text start="955.05" dur="1.65">a little bit better bit by bit.</text><text start="956.7" dur="2.76">But at the end of the day, S24 Ultra,</text><text start="959.46" dur="2.19">I really do feel like,</text><text start="961.65" dur="1.557">it feels like peak slab phone.</text><text start="963.207" dur="1.383">And there&amp;#39;s also a whole bunch of stuff</text><text start="964.59" dur="1.65">I didn&amp;#39;t even really
mention with this phone.</text><text start="966.24" dur="2.607">The haptics are really nice,
I didn&amp;#39;t even get to that.</text><text start="968.847" dur="1.773">Now there&amp;#39;s AI generated wallpapers,</text><text start="970.62" dur="1.92">a whole section for &amp;#39;em,
if you&amp;#39;re into that.</text><text start="972.54" dur="3.93">And it&amp;#39;s nice that the AI stuff
is mostly kinda tucked away</text><text start="976.47" dur="1.68">in ways where you don&amp;#39;t
ever have to use it</text><text start="978.15" dur="0.84">if you don&amp;#39;t want to,</text><text start="978.99" dur="1.71">but if you notice it
and it&amp;#39;s helpful to you,</text><text start="980.7" dur="2.13">bam, turn it on, could
be your favorite feature.</text><text start="982.83" dur="1.59">Really the only things that I miss,</text><text start="984.42" dur="2.1">from the Pixel specifically,</text><text start="986.52" dur="3.63">are Call Screening and Now Playing.</text><text start="990.15" dur="4.08">So really the best argument
not to buy this $1,300 phone</text><text start="994.23" dur="2.64">is the fact that it&amp;#39;s a $1,300 phone.</text><text start="996.87" dur="3.45">And the truth is you
can get 98% of the phone</text><text start="1000.32" dur="0.96">for much less money.</text><text start="1001.28" dur="1.5">You can see it in Samsung&amp;#39;s own lineup.</text><text start="1002.78" dur="5">Samsung&amp;#39;s own S24 Plus
has a 4,900mAh battery</text><text start="1007.85" dur="1.2">instead of a 5,000.</text><text start="1009.05" dur="3.57">It has a 6.7 inch display instead of 6.8</text><text start="1012.62" dur="2.85">and it drops the S Pen and
one of the telephoto cameras</text><text start="1015.47" dur="2.97">for $300 off.</text><text start="1018.44" dur="3.09">And you know you can get the regular S24,</text><text start="1021.53" dur="2.58">again, for much less money
with almost as much phone.</text><text start="1024.11" dur="2.94">So you don&amp;#39;t have to spend
1,300 bucks on a phone.</text><text start="1027.05" dur="1.71">But if you are going to,</text><text start="1028.76" dur="2.16">and you put the word Ultra in the name</text><text start="1030.92" dur="2.28">and you stuff as much stuff in one phone</text><text start="1033.2" dur="3.42">as you possibly can, this is
the one that you should get.</text><text start="1036.62" dur="1.35">This has all the things;</text><text start="1037.97" dur="2.22">it&amp;#39;s reliable, it&amp;#39;s
fast, it does everything,</text><text start="1040.19" dur="3.72">it checks all the boxes, it sounds great.</text><text start="1043.91" dur="1.68">It kinda feels like an ad when I just say</text><text start="1045.59" dur="3.09">all these positive things
about the phone but it&amp;#39;s not.</text><text start="1048.68" dur="2.76">Until right now, this video
is sponsored by Ridge.</text><text start="1051.44" dur="2.25">The Ridge Wallet is iconic at this point.</text><text start="1053.69" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s a minimalist, modern wallets</text><text start="1055.37" dur="2.16">like the opposite of
those old school wallets.</text><text start="1057.53" dur="2.76">It&amp;#39;s got the patented dual
track design that expands</text><text start="1060.29" dur="3.27">to hold one to 12 cards while
being as slim as possible.</text><text start="1063.56" dur="2.91">And at this point, there&amp;#39;s
like 30 plus different colors</text><text start="1066.47" dur="3.66">and styles including carbon
fiber, burnt titanium</text><text start="1070.13" dur="1.17">and forged ember.</text><text start="1071.3" dur="1.23">This one is the forged ember,</text><text start="1072.53" dur="2.49">so it&amp;#39;s got these little red
flex in it, which look cool.</text><text start="1075.02" dur="1.32">You can also get accessories for it,</text><text start="1076.34" dur="2.88">so if you wanna carry cash,
you might want the money clip</text><text start="1079.22" dur="1.95">or this one has the cash strap.</text><text start="1081.17" dur="1.5">Or if you want the Air Tag holder,</text><text start="1082.67" dur="1.62">you can get one that
holds in the Air Tag to it</text><text start="1084.29" dur="1.11">so you never lose your wallet.</text><text start="1085.4" dur="0.833">And on top of all that,</text><text start="1086.233" dur="1.207">if you get one and you don&amp;#39;t like it,</text><text start="1087.44" dur="2.88">you can return it within 99
days, no questions asked.</text><text start="1090.32" dur="1.02">So if you wanna grab one,</text><text start="1091.34" dur="2.49">you can get 10% off using code MKBHD</text><text start="1093.83" dur="3">or go to ridge.com/mkbhd.</text><text start="1096.83" dur="1.38">Tell &amp;#39;em I sent you.</text><text start="1098.21" dur="4.29">Either way, that&amp;#39;s been
it for the S24 Ultra.</text><text start="1102.5" dur="1.71">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="1104.21" dur="2.769">Catch you guys on the next one, peace.</text><text start="1106.979" dur="2.869">(soft upbeat music)</text></transcript>
