<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.141" dur="3.219">(upbeat music)</text><text start="3.36" dur="1.95">- So there&amp;#39;s two types
of people in this world:</text><text start="5.31" dur="2.64">Either AirPods fit in your ears</text><text start="7.95" dur="2.43">or AirPods don&amp;#39;t fit in your ears.</text><text start="10.38" dur="2.43">There&amp;#39;s two types of people in this world:</text><text start="12.81" dur="3.3">You either love silicon-tipped in-earbuds</text><text start="16.11" dur="3.24">or you hate silicon-tipped in-earbuds.</text><text start="19.35" dur="3">There&amp;#39;s two types of people in this world:</text><text start="22.35" dur="3.18">people who really need noise cancellation</text><text start="25.53" dur="2.1">and people who don&amp;#39;t really care about it.</text><text start="28.59" dur="1.62">But Apple wants both people&amp;#39;s money.</text><text start="30.21" dur="2.58">So there&amp;#39;s two versions of
the new AirPods this year.</text><text start="32.79" dur="1.32">It was kinda confusing
the way they announced it</text><text start="34.11" dur="1.32">at the keynote, but essentially,</text><text start="35.43" dur="3">for 129 there&amp;#39;s the base AirPods 4,</text><text start="38.43" dur="4.74">but then for 179 there&amp;#39;s AirPods
4 with noise cancellation.</text><text start="43.17" dur="2.67">But that is not the only
difference between them.</text><text start="45.84" dur="2.01">So now that I&amp;#39;ve been
testing &amp;#39;em for a few days,</text><text start="47.85" dur="1.74">I can give you the verdict on them,</text><text start="49.59" dur="2.76">what the differences are, and
if they&amp;#39;re actually worth it.</text><text start="52.35" dur="0.833">So first of all,</text><text start="53.183" dur="1.987">let&amp;#39;s just start with
the AirPods themselves.</text><text start="55.17" dur="2.61">They&amp;#39;ve tweaked the shape
of these buds again,</text><text start="57.78" dur="2.52">and so they&amp;#39;ve gotten some new
curves and some new angles,</text><text start="60.3" dur="2.22">and the driver points a
little bit more directly</text><text start="62.52" dur="2.01">into your ear with less reflections.</text><text start="64.53" dur="1.89">The stem is also a little bit shorter,</text><text start="66.42" dur="1.883">but otherwise, I mean, yeah,
they still look like AirPods.</text><text start="68.303" dur="1.477">They&amp;#39;re very familiar.</text><text start="69.78" dur="2.7">They have IP54 dust and water resistance,</text><text start="72.48" dur="1.86">up from IPX4 last year.</text><text start="74.34" dur="1.89">And they still have the in-ear detection,</text><text start="76.23" dur="2.07">there&amp;#39;s still microphones
all the way around,</text><text start="78.3" dur="1.41">but my biggest question personally,</text><text start="79.71" dur="2.19">before anything else, was actually just,</text><text start="81.9" dur="3.78">does this slightly new shape
actually fit better in my ear?</text><text start="85.68" dur="2.25">Because I have not had any luck</text><text start="87.93" dur="2.7">with hard-tipped AirPods ever really,</text><text start="90.63" dur="0.99">since they first came out.</text><text start="91.62" dur="1.59">The latest version was the closest,</text><text start="93.21" dur="1.5">like I could put them in my ears,</text><text start="94.71" dur="2.28">but if I jogged for more
than about 10 seconds,</text><text start="96.99" dur="1.62">they would just slowly fall out.</text><text start="98.61" dur="2.463">So are the 4s actually better for me?</text><text start="103.14" dur="2.43">Slightly, but not really.</text><text start="105.57" dur="1.38">I put &amp;#39;em in my ears.</text><text start="106.95" dur="3.39">I was trying to, okay, let&amp;#39;s
see if this is actually better.</text><text start="110.34" dur="2.13">I kind of twist &amp;#39;em a
little bit, do the classic,</text><text start="112.47" dur="2.4">like, you know, get &amp;#39;em seated in my ear,</text><text start="114.87" dur="3">but it&amp;#39;s not for very long.</text><text start="117.87" dur="1.92">They still slowly, even when
I&amp;#39;m just sitting around,</text><text start="119.79" dur="1.65">slowly feel like they&amp;#39;re
coming outta my ear.</text><text start="121.44" dur="2.76">So I think if you had problems
with previous AirPods,</text><text start="124.2" dur="2.13">you&amp;#39;ll probably still
have problems with these,</text><text start="126.33" dur="1.62">but if they fit in your ears,</text><text start="127.95" dur="2.07">then these will also fit in your ears.</text><text start="130.02" dur="2.19">Now, all of what I&amp;#39;ve said so far is true</text><text start="132.21" dur="2.04">about both the base AirPods</text><text start="134.25" dur="1.71">and the active noise-canceling version.</text><text start="135.96" dur="1.83">They&amp;#39;re the same size,
shame shape and everything.</text><text start="137.79" dur="1.05">Like, you can&amp;#39;t tell the difference</text><text start="138.84" dur="1.05">from the outside of the buds.</text><text start="139.89" dur="2.85">Where the differences start,
though, is this new case.</text><text start="142.74" dur="2.31">So let&amp;#39;s look at the case. The
case is a little bit smaller.</text><text start="145.05" dur="1.77">It is USB type C, thank God.</text><text start="146.82" dur="2.22">But with the base version, that&amp;#39;s it.</text><text start="149.04" dur="1.8">It&amp;#39;s just a case with USB-C.</text><text start="150.84" dur="1.65">With the noise-canceling headphones,</text><text start="152.49" dur="3.09">the case also gets a small
speaker at the bottom</text><text start="155.58" dur="2.19">so they can chime when it&amp;#39;s charging</text><text start="157.77" dur="1.8">and they make a noise when they&amp;#39;re lost,</text><text start="159.57" dur="1.47">and they have wireless charging</text><text start="161.04" dur="1.05">on the back as well,
(AirPods chime)</text><text start="162.09" dur="1.14">which is super convenient.</text><text start="163.23" dur="1.53">One thing I&amp;#39;ve noticed, though,</text><text start="164.76" dur="2.4">it doesn&amp;#39;t have MagSafe anymore,</text><text start="167.16" dur="2.37">I think because this case is literally</text><text start="169.53" dur="1.77">just slightly too small now.</text><text start="171.3" dur="1.35">So the last generation of AirPods,</text><text start="172.65" dur="2.76">the case with wireless
charging would actually align</text><text start="175.41" dur="2.58">and stick to the back
of a MagSafe charger,</text><text start="177.99" dur="1.65">which is really convenient
for just like dropping it</text><text start="179.64" dur="1.44">on the charger, not thinking about it.</text><text start="181.08" dur="2.04">But this year&amp;#39;s case, you
know, slightly smaller.</text><text start="183.12" dur="1.65">I think it&amp;#39;s just a little bit smaller</text><text start="184.77" dur="1.23">than the magnetic ring.</text><text start="186" dur="0.833">So that&amp;#39;s gone.</text><text start="186.833" dur="2.167">So it&amp;#39;ll still charge
on any cheat charger,</text><text start="189" dur="2.88">but it does not stick to it
for any sort of alignment,</text><text start="191.88" dur="0.9">which is kind of a bummer.</text><text start="192.78" dur="1.41">So if you&amp;#39;ve got one of
those upright chargers,</text><text start="194.19" dur="3.51">then you try to stick it to
it, it&amp;#39;ll just slide off now.</text><text start="197.7" dur="4.86">So USB type C, upside.
MagSafe gone, downside.</text><text start="202.56" dur="1.32">I also have noticed,</text><text start="203.88" dur="2.04">and maybe it&amp;#39;s just
&amp;#39;cause they&amp;#39;re brand new,</text><text start="205.92" dur="2.55">but it feels like the magnets holding them</text><text start="208.47" dur="2.37">into the case just feels more secure.</text><text start="210.84" dur="0.9">I think that&amp;#39;s a good thing.</text><text start="211.74" dur="2.7">And this case still works with
Apple Watch puck chargers,</text><text start="214.44" dur="1.05">by the way, fun fact.</text><text start="215.49" dur="2.52">This isn&amp;#39;t a normal cheat charger at all.</text><text start="218.01" dur="3.57">It literally only charges
Apple Watches and AirPods.</text><text start="221.58" dur="1.59">But hey, they still do magnetize,</text><text start="223.17" dur="1.56">so maybe that&amp;#39;s worth something.</text><text start="224.73" dur="1.35">And then for the hidden feature</text><text start="226.08" dur="2.28">that nobody&amp;#39;s mentioned in
any of the presentations</text><text start="228.36" dur="1.38">or keynotes or anything.</text><text start="229.74" dur="1.56">Remember the back of AirPods 3,</text><text start="231.3" dur="1.53">there was a little pairing button?</text><text start="232.83" dur="2.19">So if you were manually
pairing it to a phone</text><text start="235.02" dur="1.77">or something like that,
you would hit this button.</text><text start="236.79" dur="5">That is gone from the new AirPods 4 case.</text><text start="242.13" dur="1.35">So where did that go?</text><text start="243.48" dur="4.23">And it turns out now it&amp;#39;s a
hidden capacitive touch area,</text><text start="247.71" dur="3.12">kind of right underneath the
pairing light on the front.</text><text start="250.83" dur="2.37">So you can double tap here,
then it starts blinking,</text><text start="253.2" dur="2.01">and that initiates the pairing mode.</text><text start="255.21" dur="1.95">And actually, a triple tap will allow you</text><text start="257.16" dur="2.13">to start a factory reset of the buds.</text><text start="259.29" dur="2.73">So no longer a physical
button, kind of a hidden trick.</text><text start="262.02" dur="0.833">The more you know.</text><text start="262.853" dur="0.833">But the biggest question</text><text start="263.686" dur="2.234">that I&amp;#39;m sure most people
are actually wondering is,</text><text start="265.92" dur="2.7">how good is the Active Noise Cancellation</text><text start="268.62" dur="1.38">on these new AirPods?</text><text start="270" dur="1.83">Should you actually choose to get it</text><text start="271.83" dur="3.39">without going AirPods
Pro with silicon tips?</text><text start="275.22" dur="1.14">Is it actually good?</text><text start="276.36" dur="4.02">So my point of reference is
going to be AirPods Pro 2.</text><text start="280.38" dur="1.44">You know, obviously there&amp;#39;s
lots of other earbuds</text><text start="281.82" dur="2.97">that have ANC, but just sound quality,</text><text start="284.79" dur="1.26">apples for apples wise,</text><text start="286.05" dur="2.37">that&amp;#39;s probably the
most direct comparison.</text><text start="288.42" dur="3.06">And I&amp;#39;ll say, while these are impressive,</text><text start="291.48" dur="2.88">they are definitely not
as good as the Pros.</text><text start="294.36" dur="0.833">They&amp;#39;re just not.</text><text start="295.193" dur="2.017">And this is most definitely
because of physics.</text><text start="297.21" dur="4.23">So, since the hard tip doesn&amp;#39;t
absolutely perfectly fit</text><text start="301.44" dur="2.94">inside my ear one-to-one, it
just means there&amp;#39;s a little bit</text><text start="304.38" dur="2.37">of air gaps around the
outside of it, just a little.</text><text start="306.75" dur="1.38">There&amp;#39;s a little bit of
sound that can make it</text><text start="308.13" dur="3.87">from the outside into my ear,
literally around the earbud.</text><text start="312" dur="4.14">So whether it&amp;#39;s white noise,
or street sounds, or voices,</text><text start="316.14" dur="3.18">the ANC clearly works,
and it does a good job</text><text start="319.32" dur="2.64">of basically lowering the background noise</text><text start="321.96" dur="2.22">so you can hear whatever
you&amp;#39;re listening to better,</text><text start="324.18" dur="1.23">but it&amp;#39;s not quite gone.</text><text start="325.41" dur="3">So I feel like if AirPods
Pro are like an 8 outta 10</text><text start="328.41" dur="1.92">for noise cancellation,
just based on how much</text><text start="330.33" dur="1.86">of the background noise it&amp;#39;s removing,</text><text start="332.19" dur="3.9">these hard-tipped AirPods
are around like a four,</text><text start="336.09" dur="1.44">maybe four or five.</text><text start="337.53" dur="1.83">It&amp;#39;s less noise cancellation</text><text start="339.36" dur="3.84">and more noise reduction,
if that makes sense.</text><text start="343.2" dur="2.22">Like, still very useful,</text><text start="345.42" dur="3.63">but it&amp;#39;s most useful in
particularly loud environments.</text><text start="349.05" dur="2.91">Like, if you&amp;#39;re on a train or on a plane</text><text start="351.96" dur="2.19">or with like a lot of loud voices</text><text start="354.15" dur="1.47">or street sounds around you,</text><text start="355.62" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s when you&amp;#39;ll most
appreciate the reduction in noise</text><text start="359.04" dur="1.29">because you can hear what
you&amp;#39;re actually trying</text><text start="360.33" dur="0.833">to listen to better.</text><text start="361.163" dur="1.627">But if you&amp;#39;re in a quiet room,</text><text start="362.79" dur="2.49">or a library, or something like that,</text><text start="365.28" dur="1.62">it doesn&amp;#39;t actually make
that much of a difference.</text><text start="366.9" dur="1.32">But then, probably just as important</text><text start="368.22" dur="2.49">as noise cancellation, is
every pair of headphones</text><text start="370.71" dur="3.06">that has that should also
have transparency mode.</text><text start="373.77" dur="0.93">And these do.</text><text start="374.7" dur="3.6">And this might be the best
transparency mode I&amp;#39;ve ever heard</text><text start="378.3" dur="1.2">on any AirPods.</text><text start="379.5" dur="3.45">Sounds supernatural probably
because literally some</text><text start="382.95" dur="2.58">of the outside environment
noise is already getting in,</text><text start="385.53" dur="2.01">and so what it boosts in
through the microphones</text><text start="387.54" dur="1.2">should sound just like it.</text><text start="388.74" dur="2.433">Some other small tidbits about these:</text><text start="392.01" dur="3.06">Battery life does technically
get slightly worse</text><text start="395.07" dur="1.23">with ANC on.</text><text start="396.3" dur="3.093">So it&amp;#39;s rated for four
hours, still respectable,</text><text start="400.29" dur="2.22">but a total of 20 hours with the case</text><text start="402.51" dur="1.32">with noise cancellation.</text><text start="403.83" dur="3.57">These also now join AirPods Pro with USB-C</text><text start="407.4" dur="1.65">as the only other headphones</text><text start="409.05" dur="3.66">to have the ultra-low latency
support for Vision Pro.</text><text start="412.71" dur="1.89">So thanks, H2 chip.</text><text start="414.6" dur="1.8">And then precision finding is useful,</text><text start="416.4" dur="1.89">but that speaker does really help</text><text start="418.29" dur="1.95">if they&amp;#39;re kind of underneath something,</text><text start="420.24" dur="1.11">or inside a bag,</text><text start="421.35" dur="2.34">or you need to find it but don&amp;#39;t
really have a visual on it.</text><text start="423.69" dur="1.41">Love having the speaker on the case.</text><text start="425.1" dur="2.97">And then if you were paying
really close attention</text><text start="428.07" dur="2.67">in the last Apple keynote,
you might have caught</text><text start="430.74" dur="4.47">that there was actually
also an AirPods Max refresh</text><text start="435.21" dur="1.47">alongside these.</text><text start="436.68" dur="2.61">But I use the word
refresh like very lightly</text><text start="439.29" dur="3.6">just because all they really
did was make it USB type C</text><text start="442.89" dur="1.75">and some new colors, and that&amp;#39;s it.</text><text start="445.59" dur="0.87">Literally, that&amp;#39;s it.</text><text start="446.46" dur="2.22">They didn&amp;#39;t do any other, no mesh updates,</text><text start="448.68" dur="2.25">no case updates, no on/off switch,</text><text start="450.93" dur="2.7">no material updates, no driver updates,</text><text start="453.63" dur="3.39">no sound quality changes, no new features,</text><text start="457.02" dur="2.76">no H2 chip, just USB-C.</text><text start="459.78" dur="1.53">That&amp;#39;s absolutely ridiculous.</text><text start="461.31" dur="2.22">And I will not be
reviewing those headphones,</text><text start="463.53" dur="2.55">but what I did see is some
comments of people asking,</text><text start="466.08" dur="2.52">like, &amp;quot;Wait, what is the
H2 chip even all about?</text><text start="468.6" dur="0.9">Like, does it matter</text><text start="469.5" dur="2.52">that the new ones didn&amp;#39;t get the H2 chip?&amp;quot;</text><text start="472.02" dur="1.377">So let me just break down what that&amp;#39;s for.</text><text start="473.397" dur="3.753">The H2 chip inside these
AirPods is basically doing all</text><text start="477.15" dur="3.27">of the processing, especially
from these microphones.</text><text start="480.42" dur="2.16">So all of the improved
background noise reduction</text><text start="482.58" dur="3">for phone calls, all of the
Active Noise Cancellation,</text><text start="485.58" dur="2.28">Transparency mode, and Adaptive Audio.</text><text start="487.86" dur="2.34">And it also now lets you nod</text><text start="490.2" dur="2.46">or shake your head to
answer Siri questions.</text><text start="492.66" dur="1.83">So if there&amp;#39;s like an incoming call</text><text start="494.49" dur="2.94">and it announces a new call,
you can literally nod your head</text><text start="497.43" dur="1.68">to answer it instead of talking out loud.</text><text start="499.11" dur="3.06">Or if you get a text and Siri
asks, &amp;quot;Do you wanna respond,&amp;quot;</text><text start="502.17" dur="2.34">but you don&amp;#39;t want to, you
literally just shake your head.</text><text start="504.51" dur="1.11">It actually works super well.</text><text start="505.62" dur="1.53">But then it&amp;#39;s also just
a matter of principle.</text><text start="507.15" dur="3.637">Like, there&amp;#39;s no way
your brand-new, flagship,</text><text start="510.787" dur="2.933">$550 over-ear noise-canceling headphones</text><text start="513.72" dur="2.31">shouldn&amp;#39;t have all the latest</text><text start="516.03" dur="2.7">and greatest parts
internally and externally,</text><text start="518.73" dur="1.44">but here we are.</text><text start="520.17" dur="1.62">But anyway, the sound quality</text><text start="521.79" dur="2.82">of these new AirPods is perfectly solid.</text><text start="524.61" dur="1.53">Some people were surprised at my opinion</text><text start="526.14" dur="0.93">about this last time,</text><text start="527.07" dur="3.99">but the AirPods 3 did take a
pretty respectable step up.</text><text start="531.06" dur="2.37">And while there still is no EQ anywhere</text><text start="533.43" dur="3.42">and there&amp;#39;s not a whole lot
of customization to the sound,</text><text start="536.85" dur="3">they do a good job of sort of
being decent at everything.</text><text start="539.85" dur="3.06">&amp;#39;Cause these have to do
phone calls and podcasts,</text><text start="542.91" dur="1.74">which have a lot of vocal frequencies,</text><text start="544.65" dur="2.01">but they also have to do movies,</text><text start="546.66" dur="2.16">and they also have to do music,</text><text start="548.82" dur="3.18">and they&amp;#39;re kind of just tuned
to be solid at everything.</text><text start="552" dur="3.9">So overall, 129 for the base AirPods,</text><text start="555.9" dur="4.47">179 for the AirPods with
Active Noise Cancellation.</text><text start="560.37" dur="1.11">Now you know all the differences.</text><text start="561.48" dur="2.43">Now you know what they do
and how good they are at it,</text><text start="563.91" dur="2.85">and you can choose which
one you want for yourself.</text><text start="566.76" dur="1.173">Me personally,</text><text start="568.83" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;m still a silicon ear tips
person just for my own EarPods.</text><text start="573.03" dur="1.98">Like, they fit in my ears so much better,</text><text start="575.01" dur="1.29">the seal is so much better,</text><text start="576.3" dur="3.3">it makes the noise cancellation
dramatically better.</text><text start="579.6" dur="3.3">So I&amp;#39;m still leaning
AirPods Pro for myself.</text><text start="582.9" dur="2.19">Matter of fact, you can
get AirPods Pro on Amazon</text><text start="585.09" dur="1.65">for like 199 right now,</text><text start="586.74" dur="2.64">so it&amp;#39;s only 20 bucks more than these.</text><text start="589.38" dur="2.88">But I still think people will
happily save the 20 bucks</text><text start="592.26" dur="1.02">and get the hard-tipped ones.</text><text start="593.28" dur="2.55">They still get beat in
individual categories</text><text start="595.83" dur="1.95">by others in the wide world</text><text start="597.78" dur="1.5">of other earbuds available out there.</text><text start="599.28" dur="2.37">Like, some will have a
better fit in the ear,</text><text start="601.65" dur="1.95">which will be better for working
out and running and stuff.</text><text start="603.6" dur="2.82">Some others will have better battery life,</text><text start="606.42" dur="2.73">and even some others will
have better sound quality,</text><text start="609.15" dur="1.02">especially for music.</text><text start="610.17" dur="3.36">But these are still AirPods,
which means they work best</text><text start="613.53" dur="2.16">with the ecosystem, with
the seamless switching</text><text start="615.69" dur="2.16">between all of the Apple
devices in your life.</text><text start="617.85" dur="2.85">And they still have that sort of generic</text><text start="620.7" dur="3.45">useful frequency response
across the range for everything.</text><text start="624.15" dur="0.833">That&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re good at.</text><text start="624.983" dur="1.327">Now, if you&amp;#39;re thinking of
picking up a new pair of AirPods</text><text start="626.31" dur="3.33">but you don&amp;#39;t love the dental floss look,</text><text start="629.64" dur="1.68">well then channel sponsor
dbrand has you covered</text><text start="631.32" dur="2.13">with their new Area 51 case.</text><text start="633.45" dur="2.76">And this isn&amp;#39;t just some
regular printed design.</text><text start="636.21" dur="3.99">This topographical pattern
has a crazy like 3D-printed</text><text start="640.2" dur="2.4">texture that you can actually feel.</text><text start="642.6" dur="1.71">I honestly, I&amp;#39;m not
sure how they did this,</text><text start="644.31" dur="2.28">but the 3D ink, it&amp;#39;s super durable.</text><text start="646.59" dur="1.65">It adds this extra layer of grippiness</text><text start="648.24" dur="1.05">that&amp;#39;s hard to describe.</text><text start="649.29" dur="2.46">And this isn&amp;#39;t just some random pattern.</text><text start="651.75" dur="3.27">Apparently, dbrand put an
actual topographical map</text><text start="655.02" dur="3.48">of Area 51 on here, because
of course they would.</text><text start="658.5" dur="1.77">So there are three
different colorways of it.</text><text start="660.27" dur="2.49">There&amp;#39;s red, yellow, and black.</text><text start="662.76" dur="2.25">And I&amp;#39;m usually all in on matte black,</text><text start="665.01" dur="2.49">but this is a nice yellow,
it looks pretty sick.</text><text start="667.5" dur="2.19">And these new Area 51 skins are available</text><text start="669.69" dur="1.14">for a ton of different devices.</text><text start="670.83" dur="1.23">So I&amp;#39;ll leave a link
below in the description</text><text start="672.06" dur="1.71">if you wanna pick one up for yourself.</text><text start="673.77" dur="1.56">But that&amp;#39;s basically it.</text><text start="675.33" dur="0.833">Thanks for watching,</text><text start="676.163" dur="3.25">and I&amp;#39;ll catch you very
soon in the next one.</text><text start="680.4" dur="3.75">Peace.
