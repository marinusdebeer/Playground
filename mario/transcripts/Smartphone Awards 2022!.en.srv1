<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="2.893">(steady music)</text><text start="10.92" dur="0.833">- All right.</text><text start="12.75" dur="3.72">Welcome to the Smartphone Awards 2022.</text><text start="16.47" dur="0.99">It&amp;#39;s one of my favorite videos.</text><text start="17.46" dur="1.08">Y&amp;#39;all knew it was coming.</text><text start="18.54" dur="0.9">It&amp;#39;s a bit of a tradition</text><text start="19.44" dur="2.46">around here to revisit the smartphones</text><text start="21.9" dur="3.36">that came out during
the calendar year 2022.</text><text start="25.26" dur="4.47">And then I like to recognize
and reward some of the best</text><text start="29.73" dur="1.89">and some of the worst that came out</text><text start="31.62" dur="1.53">and some of the interesting
stuff that happened</text><text start="33.15" dur="0.833">during this calendar year.</text><text start="33.983" dur="1.897">There&amp;#39;s a lot, usually we forget
about a lot of this stuff,</text><text start="35.88" dur="2.22">but this is one of my
favorite videos to make.</text><text start="38.1" dur="2.76">We even have, of course, no spoilers,</text><text start="40.86" dur="3.12">but we&amp;#39;ve got some trophies
for the winners as well.</text><text start="43.98" dur="0.833">They&amp;#39;re super nice.</text><text start="44.813" dur="3.187">So, from flagships to
midranges to budget phones</text><text start="48" dur="4.14">to specialty phones to folding
phones, I got to use &amp;#39;em all.</text><text start="52.14" dur="3">I got, I have my own opinions
about them, and you know,</text><text start="55.14" dur="1.47">some of you may agree
with some of these awards.</text><text start="56.61" dur="1.02">Some of you may disagree,</text><text start="57.63" dur="3">but one thing is for sure
is they&amp;#39;re my awards.</text><text start="60.63" dur="2.52">So without any further ado,
let&amp;#39;s start giving &amp;#39;em out.</text><text start="63.15" dur="3.12">So, the first category is best big phone.</text><text start="66.27" dur="1.47">Now, I mean, look at this table.</text><text start="67.74" dur="2.46">Obviously, phones have gotten
bigger and bigger over time,</text><text start="70.2" dur="1.71">to the point where pretty
much every phone is big.</text><text start="71.91" dur="2.22">But I still like to reward a phone</text><text start="74.13" dur="2.64">that had a great use of that space</text><text start="76.77" dur="1.53">because you still want a big screen</text><text start="78.3" dur="2.97">but also a big battery,
maybe big speakers,</text><text start="81.27" dur="1.95">some nice cameras, and the whole thing,</text><text start="83.22" dur="3.03">just being a good use
of all that extra space.</text><text start="86.25" dur="1.89">And so, my winner for the best big phone</text><text start="88.14" dur="1.14">of the year actually came out</text><text start="89.28" dur="1.56">right near the beginning of it.</text><text start="90.84" dur="3.809">And that is Samsung&amp;#39;s Galaxy S22 Ultra.</text><text start="94.649" dur="2.461">(gentle music)
So hardware-wise, I feel</text><text start="97.11" dur="2.04">like this one just pretty
much did it all here.</text><text start="99.15" dur="1.8">It&amp;#39;s got the big 6.8 inch display,</text><text start="100.95" dur="1.92">one of the absolute best in the business.</text><text start="102.87" dur="1.74">It added a stylus</text><text start="104.61" dur="2.61">but still included a 5,000
milliamp hour battery</text><text start="107.22" dur="1.83">which is the same as the year before.</text><text start="109.05" dur="2.04">Multiple great cameras on the back,</text><text start="111.09" dur="3.48">a pair of great telephotos,
good speakers, good software,</text><text start="114.57" dur="2.31">really no hardware flaws to speak of,</text><text start="116.88" dur="1.74">to the point where maybe you&amp;#39;d
say it was kind of boring</text><text start="118.62" dur="1.32">which I think is actually a good thing.</text><text start="119.94" dur="1.65">If you&amp;#39;re looking to spend
this much on a phone,</text><text start="121.59" dur="2.97">you don&amp;#39;t want anything
to be too weird about it.</text><text start="124.56" dur="2.7">And so, yeah, this one&amp;#39;s the category</text><text start="127.26" dur="3.42">in a way that I think the
Notes usually did in the past.</text><text start="130.68" dur="2.1">So, it&amp;#39;s sort of a return of the Note.</text><text start="132.78" dur="1.8">But I do also give some runner-ups</text><text start="134.58" dur="2.04">and honorable mentions in
some of these categories too.</text><text start="136.62" dur="2.31">And that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m gonna
do in best big phone,</text><text start="138.93" dur="4.98">which means the runner-up
is the ASUS ROG Phone 6.</text><text start="143.91" dur="2.22">Really similar actually in a lot of ways</text><text start="146.13" dur="2.76">to Samsung&amp;#39;s flagships, just
missing a couple little things.</text><text start="148.89" dur="2.04">It&amp;#39;s a little more specialized,
no wireless charging,</text><text start="150.93" dur="1.14">but it&amp;#39;s got a screen on the back</text><text start="152.07" dur="1.74">and it&amp;#39;s much more gaming centric.</text><text start="153.81" dur="1.44">But I got shout it out</text><text start="155.25" dur="3.96">for the incredible, massive
stereo front facing speakers</text><text start="159.21" dur="2.01">and also the headphone jack.</text><text start="161.22" dur="2.52">Big phone, it should have
room for a headphones jack.</text><text start="163.74" dur="0.93">And then also a little shout out,</text><text start="164.67" dur="3.36">a little honorable mention
to the Xiaomi Mix Fold 2.</text><text start="168.03" dur="2.46">This, it didn&amp;#39;t have an IP
rating, it wasn&amp;#39;t quite,</text><text start="170.49" dur="1.89">you know, available
for everyone worldwide.</text><text start="172.38" dur="1.59">But this is one of those folding phones</text><text start="173.97" dur="4.5">where it folded just to
about the same thickness</text><text start="178.47" dur="1.32">as a normal phone,</text><text start="179.79" dur="2.28">which is sort of like one of
those breakthrough moments</text><text start="182.07" dur="1.41">in folding phones, I think.</text><text start="183.48" dur="1.86">And now we can start to feel like they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="185.34" dur="1.83">on their way towards being usable.</text><text start="187.17" dur="2.34">Big phone, smaller package.
(phone clicking)</text><text start="189.51" dur="1.23">All right, next category,</text><text start="190.74" dur="1.68">best small phone.</text><text start="192.42" dur="2.07">So now, we&amp;#39;re on the other
end of the spectrum, right?</text><text start="194.49" dur="1.44">There are not a lot of small phones</text><text start="195.93" dur="1.77">and this is a rare category.</text><text start="197.7" dur="2.4">And I&amp;#39;ll be honest, this one wasn&amp;#39;t close.</text><text start="200.1" dur="1.8">So, last year&amp;#39;s winner,
as you might recall,</text><text start="201.9" dur="1.92">was the iPhone Mini.</text><text start="203.82" dur="1.35">They killed that this year,</text><text start="205.17" dur="1.77">so that wasn&amp;#39;t even gonna qualify.</text><text start="206.94" dur="3.18">So, what would be the best
small phone of the year?</text><text start="210.12" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s the best small phone I&amp;#39;ve ever seen.</text><text start="211.8" dur="3.81">And that is ASUS Zenfone 9.</text><text start="215.61" dur="2.82">This phone is so nice
(gentle music)</text><text start="218.43" dur="2.1">and they made a lot of great decisions</text><text start="220.53" dur="0.84">across the board here.</text><text start="221.37" dur="3.09">So, small, it&amp;#39;s relative,
but it&amp;#39;s a 5.9 inch display,</text><text start="224.46" dur="2.4">relatively compact, flagship specs,</text><text start="226.86" dur="2.52">Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, a 1080p,</text><text start="229.38" dur="2.97">higher refresh rate, OLED, great software,</text><text start="232.35" dur="3.48">tons of ram, really fast, and
a surprisingly great camera.</text><text start="235.83" dur="2.76">And if this phone this small
can have a headphone jack,</text><text start="238.59" dur="1.92">then what&amp;#39;s everybody else&amp;#39;s excuse?</text><text start="240.51" dur="1.17">Right?</text><text start="241.68" dur="1.5">There are a lot of great
things I liked about it.</text><text start="243.18" dur="2.25">It did have a couple weird flaws,</text><text start="245.43" dur="2.07">like this weird soft touchback</text><text start="247.5" dur="1.17">that ended up discoloring a lot.</text><text start="248.67" dur="1.23">I talked about that in the main review.</text><text start="249.9" dur="2.97">But like, man, I was very surprised</text><text start="252.87" dur="1.68">by the battery life on this phone.</text><text start="254.55" dur="1.83">There&amp;#39;s not a lot of things
I get genuinely surprised</text><text start="256.38" dur="1.08">about in the smartphone world now,</text><text start="257.46" dur="3">but a phone in this small having
such a great battery life,</text><text start="260.46" dur="3.387">this is easily, easy, best
smartphone in this size.</text><text start="263.847" dur="1.563">But I will give a little
honorable mention,</text><text start="265.41" dur="1.68">a little runner up though,</text><text start="267.09" dur="1.11">because there was a certain phone</text><text start="268.2" dur="2.4">that came out right at
the very end of the year.</text><text start="270.6" dur="2.25">You guys might have wondered
why this video was so late.</text><text start="272.85" dur="1.95">I&amp;#39;ll give partial credit to this one.</text><text start="274.8" dur="4.68">Oppo Find N2, this is that
little passport sized phone.</text><text start="279.48" dur="3.24">It&amp;#39;s got these flat edges and
it&amp;#39;s still a folding phone</text><text start="282.72" dur="2.67">which has got a pretty
solid display on the inside.</text><text start="285.39" dur="1.38">I haven&amp;#39;t done a full review about it yet</text><text start="286.77" dur="1.643">but it feels like
(phone clicking)</text><text start="288.413" dur="1.957">this is a bit of a preview</text><text start="290.37" dur="3.87">to what a folding Pixel might look like</text><text start="294.24" dur="0.9">which is really interesting.</text><text start="295.14" dur="1.71">But all right, let&amp;#39;s
get to the next category</text><text start="296.85" dur="5">which is best camera, or should
I say, best camera system</text><text start="302.37" dur="0.833">across the board?</text><text start="303.203" dur="1.477">Because there is a lot to a good camera</text><text start="304.68" dur="3.18">from photo quality to video quality</text><text start="307.86" dur="3.66">but also speed of capture
and auto-focus reliability</text><text start="311.52" dur="2.88">and ease of use and file formats
and all this other stuff.</text><text start="314.4" dur="1.35">So, we did something really
interesting this year.</text><text start="315.75" dur="2.04">We did a blind smartphone camera test</text><text start="317.79" dur="2.4">in the form of a website that we built</text><text start="320.19" dur="1.86">where we gave everyone the ability to vote</text><text start="322.05" dur="3.09">on whatever photos they like
in three different categories.</text><text start="325.14" dur="2.04">And we had 16 different phones</text><text start="327.18" dur="2.49">from the year all competing
against each other.</text><text start="329.67" dur="1.8">And the overall winner</text><text start="331.47" dur="5">across all three categories
was the Pixel 6A, incredibly.</text><text start="336.63" dur="2.73">And actually, runner up
to it was the Pixel 7.</text><text start="339.36" dur="3.42">So, these are clearly some
really good photo quality phones</text><text start="342.78" dur="3">but I&amp;#39;m not giving them the
trophy for best camera system.</text><text start="345.78" dur="2.93">I&amp;#39;m also not giving it
to the vivo X80 Pro+</text><text start="348.71" dur="3.97">or X90 Pro+, which were low light kings.</text><text start="352.68" dur="1.41">They had a really great combination</text><text start="354.09" dur="3">of software and a really
impressive sensor.</text><text start="357.09" dur="2.4">The hardware stack is great, but no,</text><text start="359.49" dur="4.5">my winner for best overall camera system</text><text start="363.99" dur="4.573">in 2022 is going to the iPhone 14 Pros.</text><text start="368.563" dur="1.187">(gentle music)</text><text start="369.75" dur="2.76">So, this has now become the
longest defending champion</text><text start="372.51" dur="1.71">of a single category ever.</text><text start="374.22" dur="0.84">This is the fourth year</text><text start="375.06" dur="3.27">in a row the iPhone has taken
down the camera category,</text><text start="378.33" dur="2.22">because again, it&amp;#39;s
great across the board.</text><text start="380.55" dur="2.64">So, image quality as we
know is solid, right?</text><text start="383.19" dur="0.833">We knew that.</text><text start="384.023" dur="1.567">But the time to open the camera</text><text start="385.59" dur="2.49">to actually snap a photo
is extremely quick.</text><text start="388.08" dur="1.44">The auto focus is fast.</text><text start="389.52" dur="1.74">I&amp;#39;d say, you could fairly
give the Pro iPhones</text><text start="391.26" dur="2.58">like an A minus to a B plus for photos.</text><text start="393.84" dur="1.62">But then in the video department,</text><text start="395.46" dur="1.62">it&amp;#39;s a whole different dimension</text><text start="397.08" dur="1.74">and it&amp;#39;s not really even close.</text><text start="398.82" dur="2.58">I&amp;#39;ve been running the
auto-focus YouTube channel now</text><text start="401.4" dur="2.88">for a couple months, doing
a lot of videos on cars,</text><text start="404.28" dur="1.98">shot entirely on smartphones.</text><text start="406.26" dur="1.23">And you can tell the difference</text><text start="407.49" dur="2.79">when I shot a video on the iPhone&amp;#39;s camera</text><text start="410.28" dur="1.89">versus the other smartphone cameras.</text><text start="412.17" dur="1.47">It&amp;#39;s how good it looks.</text><text start="413.64" dur="1.23">It&amp;#39;s the audio quality.</text><text start="414.87" dur="1.65">It&amp;#39;s the consistency of color.</text><text start="416.52" dur="2.25">It&amp;#39;s the pro res, the sharpness.</text><text start="418.77" dur="1.677">I much prefer shooting videos on iPhones</text><text start="420.447" dur="1.533">and I think I&amp;#39;m not alone there.</text><text start="421.98" dur="1.86">And I&amp;#39;ll say, it still takes a long time</text><text start="423.84" dur="1.44">to get the files off of the iPhone</text><text start="425.28" dur="1.59">and I hope they fix that.</text><text start="426.87" dur="1.89">But it&amp;#39;s the winner
for best camera system.</text><text start="428.76" dur="1.59">Okay, so next up, let&amp;#39;s do the battery.</text><text start="430.35" dur="2.4">This is the best battery overall.</text><text start="432.75" dur="0.833">I think this is one</text><text start="433.583" dur="2.827">of the more objective categories probably,</text><text start="436.41" dur="2.64">but it&amp;#39;s including a
little more, obviously,</text><text start="439.05" dur="1.5">than just the battery size.</text><text start="440.55" dur="2.43">I wanna include just
the battery experience,</text><text start="442.98" dur="3.36">how long it takes to charge,
how long it lasts on a charge,</text><text start="446.34" dur="2.88">battery flexibility of
features and things like that,</text><text start="449.22" dur="1.44">how long the battery health does.</text><text start="450.66" dur="1.02">And so, my winner</text><text start="451.68" dur="5">for best battery in a 2022
phone, it is a defending champ.</text><text start="457.17" dur="3.81">It is the ASUS ROG Phone 6.
(gentle music)</text><text start="460.98" dur="2.88">This one has not a 4,000, not a 5,000,</text><text start="463.86" dur="3">but a 6,000 milliamp hour battery.</text><text start="466.86" dur="1.8">It&amp;#39;s got 65 watt fast charging,</text><text start="468.66" dur="2.13">so you can go from zero
to full in under an hour.</text><text start="470.79" dur="0.833">And on top of that,</text><text start="471.623" dur="2.857">there is a bevy of battery
management features.</text><text start="474.48" dur="2.4">So obviously, you can
turn the 165 hertz display</text><text start="476.88" dur="1.38">down all the way to 60 hertz</text><text start="478.26" dur="2.07">if you want to and get a ton of battery.</text><text start="480.33" dur="2.19">But then there&amp;#39;s also like
charge limit features,</text><text start="482.52" dur="1.98">pass through charging, things like that.</text><text start="484.5" dur="1.98">This phone is a king</text><text start="486.48" dur="1.44">as far as battery life experience</text><text start="487.92" dur="0.96">and it actually charges fast.</text><text start="488.88" dur="1.2">Probably the only knock against it is</text><text start="490.08" dur="1.5">that it doesn&amp;#39;t have wireless charging,</text><text start="491.58" dur="3.12">which most other phones in
its price range do have.</text><text start="494.7" dur="3.06">But as far as just worry-free
battery, that&amp;#39;s the winner.</text><text start="497.76" dur="1.77">And I will give a runner up</text><text start="499.53" dur="3.87">in this category to the iPhone 14 Plus.</text><text start="503.4" dur="1.35">So, a lot of us kind of saw this coming</text><text start="504.75" dur="1.77">when Apple killed the Mini iPhone</text><text start="506.52" dur="3.09">in favor of a plus-sized iPhone</text><text start="509.61" dur="2.73">that doesn&amp;#39;t have the
promotion OLED display.</text><text start="512.34" dur="3.54">So, this is a big, simple 60 hertz display</text><text start="515.88" dur="3.06">that is just powered by a
massive battery in the iPhone,</text><text start="518.94" dur="1.56">massive four in iPhone.</text><text start="520.5" dur="1.62">And so, with wireless charging</text><text start="522.12" dur="1.62">and with all the other
things that Apple does</text><text start="523.74" dur="2.55">to prevent batteries from having problems,</text><text start="526.29" dur="2.43">I&amp;#39;d say that&amp;#39;s a pretty
great battery experience.</text><text start="528.72" dur="2.55">And I&amp;#39;ll also give a quick
shout out, an honorable mention,</text><text start="531.27" dur="2.94">because the ASUS Zenfone 9, I gotta,</text><text start="534.21" dur="1.41">I keep coming back to this,</text><text start="535.62" dur="1.98">the way it surprised me with battery life.</text><text start="537.6" dur="2.67">This is a 4,300 milliamp
battery in this phone.</text><text start="540.27" dur="1.95">It also doesn&amp;#39;t have wireless charging.</text><text start="542.22" dur="1.8">The charging speed is decent,</text><text start="544.02" dur="1.86">but I was genuinely shocked</text><text start="545.88" dur="2.28">by how well this phone held up on battery.</text><text start="548.16" dur="2.13">It&amp;#39;s, who would&amp;#39;ve
thought that a phone small</text><text start="550.29" dur="2.64">like this would&amp;#39;ve one
of the best batteries</text><text start="552.93" dur="2.43">of any phone that came out
during the calendar year?</text><text start="555.36" dur="3.453">But anyway, okay, next
up is the design award.</text><text start="559.68" dur="2.07">I feel like this is the
hardest one every year</text><text start="561.75" dur="1.14">to think of or to give out,</text><text start="562.89" dur="2.22">just because it is the
most subjective now.</text><text start="565.11" dur="2.19">This is, it&amp;#39;s actually
changed over the years.</text><text start="567.3" dur="3.57">It used to be, I think I
called it best build quality</text><text start="570.87" dur="1.65">or just best overall build</text><text start="572.52" dur="1.8">or materials or industrial design.</text><text start="574.32" dur="2.37">But it&amp;#39;s eventually
just evolved into like,</text><text start="576.69" dur="1.77">who can step outside of the box</text><text start="578.46" dur="2.64">and do things a little
different design-wise?</text><text start="581.1" dur="2.01">&amp;#39;Cause that honestly
does not happen very much</text><text start="583.11" dur="0.96">in smartphones these days.</text><text start="584.07" dur="1.35">And sometimes, it kind
of feels like a process</text><text start="585.42" dur="0.9">of elimination, like, oh,</text><text start="586.32" dur="3.66">I can&amp;#39;t give this to a phone

the same as last year.</text><text start="592.56" dur="1.62">I definitely can&amp;#39;t give it to a phone</text><text start="594.18" dur="1.89">that made like an obvious regression</text><text start="596.07" dur="2.4">from the year before or

literally the best thing</text><text start="627.12" dur="2.07">about this phone, maybe second best.</text><text start="629.19" dur="2.4">So, it&amp;#39;s got this sort of transparent look</text><text start="631.59" dur="1.77">which is definitely trying something new.</text><text start="633.36" dur="3.03">And then the glyph interface
with these lights on the back,</text><text start="636.39" dur="1.71">they light up for notifications.</text><text start="638.1" dur="1.26">They can also light up</text><text start="639.36" dur="2.58">as a fill flash for video if you want.</text><text start="641.94" dur="2.52">It also has a wireless

battery is as you&amp;#39;re charging.</text><text start="655.68" dur="1.5">I don&amp;#39;t know, little things like that.</text><text start="657.18" dur="1.95">You don&amp;#39;t see a lot of
phones trying new stuff.</text><text start="659.13" dur="2.43">The rest of the phone happens
to be pretty good too.</text><text start="661.56" dur="2.49">So, I have no problem
giving the Nothing Phone</text><text start="664.05" dur="1.56">the design award for 2022.</text><text start="665.61" dur="1.89">And then I do also want to
give an honorable mention</text><text start="667.5" dur="4.26">in design to that Xiaomi Mix Fold 2.</text><text start="671.76" dur="1.44">There were a number of folding phones</text><text start="673.2" dur="2.01">that came out during this year,</text><text start="675.21" dur="1.35">but as I mentioned earlier,</text><text start="676.56" dur="4.05">this is the first one that
sort of passed that barrier</text><text start="680.61" dur="4.08">of actually being the same
thickness as a normal phone.</text><text start="684.69" dur="0.833">I mean, look at,</text><text start="685.523" dur="1.532">this is another phone that
came out during this year.</text><text start="687.055" dur="2.885">It&amp;#39;s very close in overall thickness.</text><text start="689.94" dur="1.35">So, a lot of phones you pick up,</text><text start="691.29" dur="1.35">like this is Samsung&amp;#39;s folding, you,</text><text start="692.64" dur="2.04">it just feel, it&amp;#39;s thicker
than a normal phone.</text><text start="694.68" dur="1.47">And you&amp;#39;d think about that all the time</text><text start="696.15" dur="0.833">when you&amp;#39;re using it.</text><text start="696.983" dur="2.017">So, I wanted to reward this
one for actually getting</text><text start="699" dur="1.71">to that point where now,</text><text start="700.71" dur="2.55">there&amp;#39;s other things to fix
still about folding phones,</text><text start="703.26" dur="3.03">but this feels very usable and pocketable</text><text start="706.29" dur="1.74">and gives you the benefits of unfolding</text><text start="708.03" dur="0.871">to a huge screen.</text><text start="708.901" dur="1.079">(phone clicking)
Shout out to Xiaomi.</text><text start="709.98" dur="1.86">All right, let&amp;#39;s give out a value award.</text><text start="711.84" dur="0.833">I like this one.</text><text start="712.673" dur="0.907">This is,</text><text start="713.58" dur="2.61">this was actually pretty
close as well this year too.</text><text start="716.19" dur="2.4">Notice it&amp;#39;s one of the
more controversial awards.</text><text start="718.59" dur="2.97">It used to be best budget phone</text><text start="721.56" dur="2.79">but budget means something
different for everyone.</text><text start="724.35" dur="2.82">So, I&amp;#39;m just calling this
like best bang for the buck.</text><text start="727.17" dur="2.64">You can kind of picture
the pyramid of phones,</text><text start="729.81" dur="1.41">and when you see a good one,</text><text start="731.22" dur="1.11">you know what I&amp;#39;m talking about.</text><text start="732.33" dur="1.62">When you see a phone

599 phones I have ever seen.</text><text start="749.94" dur="0.833">I mean it&amp;#39;s pretty clear.</text><text start="750.773" dur="2.407">It&amp;#39;s the whole Google flagship experience.</text><text start="753.18" dur="1.86">It&amp;#39;s also got the tensor chip flagship,</text><text start="755.04" dur="1.47">same as the more expensive one.</text><text start="756.51" dur="1.98">It&amp;#39;s also got the same main sensor,</text><text start="758.49" dur="2.76">the same flagship camera

the 7 Pro kind of feel</text><text start="766.83" dur="0.833">like not that good of a deal</text><text start="767.663" dur="3.367">&amp;#39;cause 599, there is not
a lot that you can get</text><text start="771.03" dur="2.19">for this price that does this well.</text><text start="773.22" dur="1.92">In fact, I&amp;#39;d argue nothing.</text><text start="775.14" dur="1.62">So, this is one of my favorite phones</text><text start="776.76" dur="1.47">that came out this year,</text><text start="778.23" dur="2.76">but it just barely beats out another one</text><text start="780.99" dur="2.07">of my favorite phones
that came out this year</text><text start="783.06" dur="5">which is ASUS Zenfone

reader on the side,</text><text start="800.13" dur="2.22">a headphone jack and
incredible battery life.</text><text start="802.35" dur="1.56">I mean these two phones
could go back and forth</text><text start="803.91" dur="0.833">head to head.</text><text start="804.743" dur="1.657">I could easily be swayed here.</text><text start="806.4" dur="2.4">But those two were awesome to see.</text><text start="808.8" dur="2.04">That&amp;#39;s probably the best
699 phone I&amp;#39;ve ever seen.</text><text start="810.84" dur="3.15">And among the myriad of other
really good sub $400 phones</text><text start="813.99" dur="1.71">that came out, I want to
give an honorable mention</text><text start="815.7" dur="2.52">to the Realme 10 Pro+.</text><text start="818.22" dur="2.22">This had a big 6.7 inch display.</text><text start="820.44" dur="1.32">You can see the cameras on the back,</text><text start="821.76" dur="1.74">5,000 milliamp hour battery.</text><text start="823.5" dur="2.28">But this camera performed
surprisingly well</text><text start="825.78" dur="1.08">to a lot of people.</text><text start="826.86" dur="1.71">It ended up beating thousand dollar phones</text><text start="828.57" dur="2.34">and it was second place
in votes per dollar</text><text start="830.91" dur="1.92">in our blind smartphone camera test.</text><text start="832.83" dur="3.33">Really good overall package
for about 350 bucks.</text><text start="836.16" dur="1.11">I like the way this launched</text><text start="837.27" dur="3.39">and I think if you can get
over the way it shines,</text><text start="840.66" dur="0.84">it&amp;#39;s a really good one.</text><text start="841.5" dur="1.533">All right, bust of the year.</text><text start="844.02" dur="1.68">You know, we give it out every year.</text><text start="845.7" dur="1.86">You don&amp;#39;t like giving it out,</text><text start="847.56" dur="2.133">but it&amp;#39;s the one you hate to have to give.</text><text start="850.65" dur="1.02">You know, there&amp;#39;s a lot of phones</text><text start="851.67" dur="2.61">that played it really

a lot of boring phones</text><text start="857.91" dur="3">to just have been too
boring, bust of the year,</text><text start="860.91" dur="3.06">I wish they did something
more exciting or interesting</text><text start="863.97" dur="1.38">but I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="865.35" dur="2.13">A lot of phones these
days are very similar</text><text start="867.48" dur="1.95">to their previous years and
I won&amp;#39;t penalize &amp;#39;em for that</text><text start="869.43" dur="1.53">if the previous phone is good.</text><text start="870.96" dur="2.97">I really only had one
pick for bust of the year</text><text start="873.93" dur="3.87">and that&amp;#39;s the OnePlus 10T,
(gentle music)</text><text start="877.8" dur="2.97">not a whole ton to say here.</text><text start="880.77" dur="3.72">It wins this award for
having a pretty big delta</text><text start="884.49" dur="5">between expectations and
possibilities versus actual result.</text><text start="889.8" dur="2.28">Not all of that is OnePlus&amp;#39;s fault,</text><text start="892.08" dur="3.09">but I mean they&amp;#39;ve been on
this slight downward trend</text><text start="895.17" dur="4.62">of value and reputation
and software experience</text><text start="899.79" dur="2.61">and cameras and a whole bunch
of other things like that.</text><text start="902.4" dur="1.2">There&amp;#39;s just not a whole lot to like,</text><text start="903.6" dur="2.34">and it also just feels
like the identity has sort</text><text start="905.94" dur="2.4">of been eroded very quickly over time.</text><text start="908.34" dur="2.28">We just had the Hasselblad thing added</text><text start="910.62" dur="2.34">to the previous OnePlus flagship phone</text><text start="912.96" dur="1.83">and then the 10T comes out</text><text start="914.79" dur="1.62">and they don&amp;#39;t even bother with it.</text><text start="916.41" dur="1.71">I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re
saving it for the pro phones,</text><text start="918.12" dur="1.32">but it&amp;#39;s like, what do you, what is this?</text><text start="919.44" dur="2.73">What do you even say about
OnePlus phones anymore?</text><text start="922.17" dur="2.7">There&amp;#39;s no, you can&amp;#39;t even
describe a OnePlus phone</text><text start="924.87" dur="2.13">without feeling really generic.</text><text start="927" dur="3.33">So anyway, yeah, congrats on
