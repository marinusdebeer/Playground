<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text><text start="3.54" dur="2.88">- So we just got done with
possibly one of the biggest</text><text start="6.42" dur="3.72">Apple WWDC keynotes of all time, maybe,</text><text start="10.14" dur="1.83">just because of the state of the world</text><text start="11.97" dur="3.03">and what everyone expects
from tech companies in 2024,</text><text start="15" dur="3.33">which is AI at the front of what you do.</text><text start="18.33" dur="2.13">Interestingly, with Apple this time,</text><text start="20.46" dur="3.27">Apple had AI at the back
half of what they did.</text><text start="23.73" dur="1.95">Literally, the entire
first half of the keynote,</text><text start="25.68" dur="2.7">they didn&amp;#39;t say AI once, zero times.</text><text start="28.38" dur="1.987">Then the second hour,
they basically just went,</text><text start="30.367" dur="1.493">&amp;quot;All right, yeah, we, we actually do have</text><text start="31.86" dur="1.53">a lot of AI stuff to share with you.&amp;quot;</text><text start="33.39" dur="1.26">And they just spit it all out.</text><text start="34.65" dur="2.46">And of course they did manage to brand it</text><text start="37.11" dur="1.59">because of course they did.</text><text start="38.7" dur="3">AI for them is now Apple Intelligence.</text><text start="41.7" dur="2.46">But look, I watched and live tweeted</text><text start="44.16" dur="2.64">the entire two-hour long
keynote so you don&amp;#39;t have to.</text><text start="46.8" dur="1.14">And I&amp;#39;ve gathered all my thoughts</text><text start="47.94" dur="1.14">on all the most important announcements,</text><text start="49.08" dur="2.76">so this is everything you
need to know that&amp;#39;s new</text><text start="51.84" dur="1.05">and some of my takes on it.</text><text start="52.89" dur="1.71">So I&amp;#39;m gonna go in the
same order that Apple went.</text><text start="54.6" dur="1.47">I&amp;#39;m gonna start with VisionOS,</text><text start="56.07" dur="3.12">and we&amp;#39;re already on,
somehow, VisionOS 2.0</text><text start="59.19" dur="2.4">less than half a year after the Vision Pro</text><text start="61.59" dur="1.53">first got announced.</text><text start="63.12" dur="1.53">And there are some solid new features,</text><text start="64.65" dur="2.04">but I don&amp;#39;t know if I
would call this 2.0 worthy.</text><text start="66.69" dur="1.86">It feels more like a 1.2 update,</text><text start="68.55" dur="2.22">but, okay, whatever, we&amp;#39;ll go with it.</text><text start="70.77" dur="1.8">So there&amp;#39;s a new wrist turn gesture</text><text start="72.57" dur="2.46">to quickly see the time and
your battery percentage,</text><text start="75.03" dur="1.5">and then you can jump right from there</text><text start="76.53" dur="1.17">into the control center,</text><text start="77.7" dur="2.13">instead of having to look
way up at the ceiling</text><text start="79.83" dur="1.86">like you had to before every time.</text><text start="81.69" dur="1.65">It kinda reminds me of the Oculus Quest.</text><text start="83.34" dur="1.35">That is easy. That&amp;#39;s an upgrade.</text><text start="84.69" dur="2.16">There&amp;#39;s a bunch of
immersive media features,</text><text start="86.85" dur="2.76">like they let you go
through your old photos</text><text start="89.61" dur="1.68">and use advanced machine learning</text><text start="91.29" dur="2.76">to turn them into spatial photos,</text><text start="94.05" dur="3.12">which is really interesting if it works.</text><text start="97.17" dur="1.89">And there are also new
tools to help people create</text><text start="99.06" dur="2.04">spatial videos and immersive videos</text><text start="101.1" dur="2.34">on cameras other than the iPhone,</text><text start="103.44" dur="3.3">but then of course you can
only view them on a Vision Pro.</text><text start="106.74" dur="2.64">So who knows how valuable this
will actually turn out to be.</text><text start="109.38" dur="2.4">But then, this year, Mac mirroring</text><text start="111.78" dur="1.68">will get way more resolution</text><text start="113.46" dur="3.69">thanks to it now doing the
foveated rendering on the Mac.</text><text start="117.15" dur="1.5">So basically it frees
up a ton of resources</text><text start="118.65" dur="2.22">and it lets you do up to
double the resolution.</text><text start="120.87" dur="3.3">So you could do a gigantic
ultra wide if you want it to be.</text><text start="124.17" dur="2.97">That is way more room for
windows and activities.</text><text start="127.14" dur="0.833">Love that.</text><text start="127.973" dur="2.137">And that&amp;#39;s pretty much it.</text><text start="130.11" dur="2.31">Again, it&amp;#39;s not the biggest
2.0 update we&amp;#39;ve ever seen,</text><text start="132.42" dur="2.28">but it does feel like there&amp;#39;s
some nice updates in there,</text><text start="134.7" dur="2.16">including some new environments</text><text start="136.86" dur="3.363">and the ability to
rearrange your home screen.</text><text start="141.09" dur="1.62">Believe it or not, you
couldn&amp;#39;t do that before.</text><text start="142.71" dur="0.833">Now you can.</text><text start="143.543" dur="2.677">But speaking of rearranging
your home screen,</text><text start="146.22" dur="2.37">iOS just got one of the biggest</text><text start="148.59" dur="4.65">or at least most interesting
updates in a long time.</text><text start="153.24" dur="0.96">And I&amp;#39;m just gonna...</text><text start="154.2" dur="0.87">If you&amp;#39;re an Android user,</text><text start="155.07" dur="2.64">I&amp;#39;d say for the next like
two minutes, three minutes,</text><text start="157.71" dur="2.55">just go ahead and unplug
your keyboard for a second</text><text start="160.26" dur="1.05">and just relax.</text><text start="161.31" dur="2.31">&amp;#39;Cause yes, we&amp;#39;ve had these
features for a long time,</text><text start="163.62" dur="3.36">but now it&amp;#39;s the iPhone&amp;#39;s
time to shine, all right?</text><text start="166.98" dur="3.03">So, officially, you will
finally be able to put icons</text><text start="170.01" dur="4.89">wherever you want on the
iOS 18 home screen grid.</text><text start="174.9" dur="1.23">And it was hilarious that this got</text><text start="176.13" dur="2.97">a whole applause moment from
the audience during the keynote</text><text start="179.1" dur="2.76">as if they just invented a new feature.</text><text start="181.86" dur="2.64">But fine, you&amp;#39;ve been waiting
for a long time for this.</text><text start="184.5" dur="0.84">Have your fun.</text><text start="185.34" dur="1.2">But they didn&amp;#39;t stop there.</text><text start="186.54" dur="2.58">They added a whole bunch of
other customization features</text><text start="189.12" dur="1.83">to the iPhone home screen too,</text><text start="190.95" dur="2.73">and it started to get a
little more interesting.</text><text start="193.68" dur="2.13">See, there&amp;#39;s this new theme engine now</text><text start="195.81" dur="2.31">that lets you go in and change the color</text><text start="198.12" dur="3.42">of every icon and widget
on your home screen</text><text start="201.54" dur="1.29">to the same color.</text><text start="202.83" dur="2.1">So you can match your wallpaper</text><text start="204.93" dur="2.55">with your icons to frame it nicely</text><text start="207.48" dur="1.56">and have matching colors everywhere.</text><text start="209.04" dur="1.17">It&amp;#39;s a simple thing</text><text start="210.21" dur="2.7">and we&amp;#39;ve been doing it on
Android with launchers for years,</text><text start="212.91" dur="2.73">but the thing about these is,</text><text start="215.64" dur="1.29">before this moment,</text><text start="216.93" dur="2.49">basically every iPhone home
screen looked the same.</text><text start="219.42" dur="1.32">We&amp;#39;ve been saying that.</text><text start="220.74" dur="3.15">They&amp;#39;ve just given you
the ability to go crazy</text><text start="223.89" dur="3.27">and kind of ruin your home
screen if you want to,</text><text start="227.16" dur="2.73">and people seem to absolutely want to.</text><text start="229.89" dur="2.64">I have seen some rough home screens</text><text start="232.53" dur="1.56">people are making on Twitter.</text><text start="234.09" dur="1.35">A lot of them just look terrible.</text><text start="235.44" dur="1.98">And I think the main thing
I noticed is it seems like</text><text start="237.42" dur="5">there are apps that support
this whole colored thing well,</text><text start="242.46" dur="2.49">and then there are apps that don&amp;#39;t,</text><text start="244.95" dur="2.04">that just looks like
it tints the entire...</text><text start="246.99" dur="1.86">It just literally applies a color cast</text><text start="248.85" dur="1.98">to the entire icon on your home screen,</text><text start="250.83" dur="2.7">which causes all kinds
of legibility problems.</text><text start="253.53" dur="1.02">Doesn&amp;#39;t look good.</text><text start="254.55" dur="2.55">There are widgets that look horrible.</text><text start="257.1" dur="0.99">It&amp;#39;s just unreadable.</text><text start="258.09" dur="3.03">So yeah, you can make some pretty-looking</text><text start="261.12" dur="1.26">home screens if you want,</text><text start="262.38" dur="2.76">but you can also make some
really ugly looking home screens.</text><text start="265.14" dur="0.833">And I was trying to decide</text><text start="265.973" dur="1.777">if I like this more or
less than what Google did</text><text start="267.75" dur="1.98">on the Pixels with Material You</text><text start="269.73" dur="2.52">I think, technically, it&amp;#39;s better</text><text start="272.25" dur="2.37">because it works on all of the icons.</text><text start="274.62" dur="1.35">I don&amp;#39;t know how many setups I&amp;#39;ve tried</text><text start="275.97" dur="1.62">where I wanna do the monochrome icons,</text><text start="277.59" dur="2.43">but there are just a few of
my apps that aren&amp;#39;t supported,</text><text start="280.02" dur="1.53">so they end up looking kind of,</text><text start="281.55" dur="1.56">like they stick out like a sore thumb.</text><text start="283.11" dur="1.59">So at least Apple&amp;#39;s is letting you change</text><text start="284.7" dur="1.32">all of the icons at once.</text><text start="286.02" dur="2.73">But anyway, Apple&amp;#39;s also
redesigned the Control Center</text><text start="288.75" dur="3.48">to be fully customizable
across multiple pages.</text><text start="292.23" dur="2.34">So again, there&amp;#39;s a
lot more going on here,</text><text start="294.57" dur="1.14">and there are many more</text><text start="295.71" dur="2.91">customizable shortcuts in more places,</text><text start="298.62" dur="3.3">including finally replacing
the flashlight and camera</text><text start="301.92" dur="2.46">on the home screen without
jail breaking, finally.</text><text start="304.38" dur="0.9">And the list keeps going.</text><text start="305.28" dur="1.08">Stop me if you&amp;#39;ve heard these before,</text><text start="306.36" dur="3.96">but you can do hidden apps
now inside your app drawer.</text><text start="310.32" dur="3.3">So you can lock apps into a hidden folder</text><text start="313.62" dur="2.1">that makes it easier than ever</text><text start="315.72" dur="3.03">to hide Tinder from your wife.</text><text start="318.75" dur="2.7">There&amp;#39;s also scheduled
text messages in iMessage.</text><text start="321.45" dur="2.97">Great, finally, they&amp;#39;re
having some fun over there.</text><text start="324.42" dur="1.44">There&amp;#39;s also text formatting.</text><text start="325.86" dur="2.04">There&amp;#39;s messages via satellite.</text><text start="327.9" dur="3.15">RCS support was very casually
but briefly mentioned.</text><text start="331.05" dur="1.41">The Photos app is redesigned.</text><text start="332.46" dur="1.2">There&amp;#39;s also a game mode</text><text start="333.66" dur="1.68">that now minimizes background activity</text><text start="335.34" dur="2.34">and minimizes Bluetooth
latency for peripherals.</text><text start="337.68" dur="0.833">Great.</text><text start="338.513" dur="3.277">And a new automatic categorization
in the new Mail app.</text><text start="341.79" dur="1.62">So you can tell, there&amp;#39;s
been a whole bunch of stuff.</text><text start="343.41" dur="2.04">I will definitely be doing a larger,</text><text start="345.45" dur="2.58">more focused just iOS 18 video,</text><text start="348.03" dur="1.56">so you can see everything that&amp;#39;s new.</text><text start="349.59" dur="0.9">There&amp;#39;s plenty of little stuff</text><text start="350.49" dur="1.68">that didn&amp;#39;t make it into the keynote,</text><text start="352.17" dur="2.61">so I&amp;#39;ll do a whole deep
dive just for that.</text><text start="354.78" dur="2.64">Make sure you subscribe to be
among the first to see that.</text><text start="357.42" dur="4.26">I believe we are catching
up to Apple in subscribers.</text><text start="361.68" dur="1.86">It&amp;#39;d be kind of nice if we pass them.</text><text start="363.54" dur="0.833">That&amp;#39;d be sick.</text><text start="364.373" dur="1.687">So then AirPods got minor updates,</text><text start="366.06" dur="2.25">like voice isolation during phone calls,</text><text start="368.31" dur="2.52">spatial audio during games,</text><text start="370.83" dur="1.89">and the ability to respond to a prompt</text><text start="372.72" dur="2.37">just by nodding or shaking your head,</text><text start="375.09" dur="1.86">taken right from the Sony headphones.</text><text start="376.95" dur="0.93">I kinda like it though,</text><text start="377.88" dur="2.34">controlling it without
using your voice is nice.</text><text start="380.22" dur="1.65">Then Apple TV gets this new feature</text><text start="381.87" dur="1.8">where you swipe down on the remote</text><text start="383.67" dur="1.26">at any point during a show,</text><text start="384.93" dur="1.47">and it just shows you all the actors</text><text start="386.4" dur="2.16">and character names of
the people on the screen</text><text start="388.56" dur="2.899">and any song that&amp;#39;s playing
in that moment in real time.</text><text start="391.459" dur="1.721">And there&amp;#39;s also a feature
that boosts people&amp;#39;s voices</text><text start="393.18" dur="1.74">so you can always hear
them over the music.</text><text start="394.92" dur="2.79">And then watchOS, they got
this little training mode</text><text start="397.71" dur="2.73">that sort of balances the trends
in your training over time</text><text start="400.44" dur="1.92">and evaluates how hard a workout was</text><text start="402.36" dur="1.5">versus how hard it could have been.</text><text start="403.86" dur="1.95">And then iPadOS.</text><text start="405.81" dur="3.06">So this was supposed to
be Apple&amp;#39;s big chance</text><text start="408.87" dur="2.58">to really convince us that the iPad,</text><text start="411.45" dur="3.03">it&amp;#39;s something special that&amp;#39;s
got a little something to it</text><text start="414.48" dur="1.8">that would make us convinced</text><text start="416.28" dur="1.35">that we&amp;#39;d wanna get the newest one,</text><text start="417.63" dur="1.68">the M4 one that just came out</text><text start="419.31" dur="2.583">over just your phone or over a Mac.</text><text start="422.82" dur="5">And I&amp;#39;ll say it did get
one incredible feature,</text><text start="427.86" dur="2.58">but it didn&amp;#39;t really
do much more than that.</text><text start="430.44" dur="1.65">So the iPad it, it gets all the stuff</text><text start="432.09" dur="1.47">I talked about with the iPhone, right?</text><text start="433.56" dur="1.83">Full home screen customization,</text><text start="435.39" dur="1.71">customizable Control Center,</text><text start="437.1" dur="1.62">the new Photos app, et cetera.</text><text start="438.72" dur="0.93">It&amp;#39;s all great.</text><text start="439.65" dur="1.74">There&amp;#39;s also a feature in SharePlay</text><text start="441.39" dur="1.62">that lets you go in and actually</text><text start="443.01" dur="4.32">remotely control someone&amp;#39;s
iPad when they allow it,</text><text start="447.33" dur="1.35">which seems like a small thing,</text><text start="448.68" dur="3.72">but I promise you that is
massive for family tech support.</text><text start="452.4" dur="0.833">You know who you are.</text><text start="453.233" dur="3.997">But the one massive actually
impressive new feature</text><text start="457.23" dur="2.85">on the iPad in iPadOS 18,</text><text start="460.08" dur="1.23">and you think I&amp;#39;m joking,</text><text start="461.31" dur="2.94">but I&amp;#39;m dead serious when I say this.</text><text start="464.25" dur="1.47">It&amp;#39;s the Calculator app.</text><text start="465.72" dur="0.99">It&amp;#39;s the new calculator.</text><text start="466.71" dur="2.19">I promise you I was so
ready to dunk on this.</text><text start="468.9" dur="3.24">I had a tweet drafted up as
they were talking about it.</text><text start="472.14" dur="2.04">We finally brought the
calculator to the iPad,</text><text start="474.18" dur="0.99">and there were screenshots of it,</text><text start="475.17" dur="1.5">and it looked just like the iPhone app.</text><text start="476.67" dur="1.44">And I was like, &amp;quot;Really?</text><text start="478.11" dur="1.29">This is what you were so hyped about?&amp;quot;</text><text start="479.4" dur="1.2">I had that clip queued up ready</text><text start="480.6" dur="1.177">of Craig Federighi being like,</text><text start="481.777" dur="2.693">&amp;quot;Yes, we had to do something super special</text><text start="484.47" dur="2.64">to finally bring that
calculator to the iPad.&amp;quot;</text><text start="487.11" dur="3.63">But then they pulled the
Apple pencil off the side</text><text start="490.74" dur="4.05">and they pulled up
what&amp;#39;s called Math Notes,</text><text start="494.79" dur="0.833">and it was pretty sick.</text><text start="495.623" dur="3.067">So now, on the iPad, you
can actually write down</text><text start="498.69" dur="2.19">equations in handwriting,</text><text start="500.88" dur="1.8">and it will understand what you wrote,</text><text start="502.68" dur="3.51">and it&amp;#39;ll answer the question
and in your handwriting.</text><text start="506.19" dur="1.59">And then if you adjust the equation</text><text start="507.78" dur="1.8">or add new information or something,</text><text start="509.58" dur="3.03">it automatically updates the answer,</text><text start="512.61" dur="1.8">which was so sick.</text><text start="514.41" dur="1.32">I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m
so impressed with this,</text><text start="515.73" dur="1.74">but it was really cool
to play with and look at.</text><text start="517.47" dur="2.22">So if that wasn&amp;#39;t impressive enough,</text><text start="519.69" dur="1.44">it also supports variables.</text><text start="521.13" dur="2.22">So you can have variables
written all over the page.</text><text start="523.35" dur="0.87">So look at this.</text><text start="524.22" dur="3.6">It has G, and X, and A, and H,</text><text start="527.82" dur="3.27">and then it&amp;#39;s labeled
Y as the height here.</text><text start="531.09" dur="3.24">So you can ask for an equation
using these variables,</text><text start="534.33" dur="2.01">and it can give you an answer.</text><text start="536.34" dur="3.21">And if you want, you can
do a y equals equation,</text><text start="539.55" dur="3.06">and it&amp;#39;ll give you a graph
with real time adjustment</text><text start="542.61" dur="2.85">of any of the variables in your equation.</text><text start="545.46" dur="2.31">I mean, I wish I was in sixth grade again,</text><text start="547.77" dur="1.68">so this could be my full-time calculator.</text><text start="549.45" dur="0.833">This is sick.</text><text start="550.283" dur="0.997">Now, at this point in the keynote,</text><text start="551.28" dur="1.92">they haven&amp;#39;t even actually said</text><text start="553.2" dur="2.85">the word AI a single time yet.</text><text start="556.05" dur="1.62">I think this is pretty clearly AI.</text><text start="557.67" dur="1.5">This is like handwriting recognition.</text><text start="559.17" dur="1.89">This is like semantic understanding</text><text start="561.06" dur="1.32">of all the things happening on the page.</text><text start="562.38" dur="1.62">It&amp;#39;s good AI.</text><text start="564" dur="2.31">Well played, Craig, you did it, okay,</text><text start="566.31" dur="2.91">but this is before the actual AI section.</text><text start="569.22" dur="1.74">But also this wasn&amp;#39;t mentioned on stage,</text><text start="570.96" dur="2.28">but this is also coming to</text><text start="573.24" dur="2.13">the iPhone&amp;#39;s Calculator app as well.</text><text start="575.37" dur="1.47">But then Mac OS.</text><text start="576.84" dur="1.38">Mac OS has its newest version.</text><text start="578.22" dur="1.77">It&amp;#39;s called Sequoia,</text><text start="579.99" dur="2.88">and it does also get a nice
little grab bag of new features.</text><text start="582.87" dur="3.48">There&amp;#39;s automatic window
snapping now finally built in.</text><text start="586.35" dur="1.74">You don&amp;#39;t need a third
party app to do it anymore.</text><text start="588.09" dur="1.32">Sherlocked.</text><text start="589.41" dur="1.95">There&amp;#39;s built in backgrounds for any app</text><text start="591.36" dur="1.77">that uses the webcam feed.</text><text start="593.13" dur="2.13">There&amp;#39;s also a new password
app that basically just takes</text><text start="595.26" dur="1.74">what was buried in the settings before</text><text start="597" dur="1.77">and just makes it its own standalone app.</text><text start="598.77" dur="3.51">So it&amp;#39;s actually on Mac,
iPad, and the iPhone.</text><text start="602.28" dur="3.69">But probably the biggest
thing is iPhone Mirroring.</text><text start="605.97" dur="1.89">So this is another continuity feature</text><text start="607.86" dur="1.38">that basically just lets you</text><text start="609.24" dur="3.78">wirelessly always see
your iPhone on your Mac.</text><text start="613.02" dur="3.93">It merges your notifications
and audio with your Mac</text><text start="616.95" dur="1.77">and lets you drag and
drop things back and forth</text><text start="618.72" dur="2.67">between your phone that&amp;#39;s
sitting next to you and your Mac.</text><text start="621.39" dur="1.62">I kinda wonder if this
hits your phone battery</text><text start="623.01" dur="0.833">harder than normal.</text><text start="623.843" dur="1.147">They didn&amp;#39;t really say, obviously,</text><text start="624.99" dur="0.9">so I&amp;#39;m gonna have to test this.</text><text start="625.89" dur="2.13">But I imagine if you&amp;#39;re just
sitting on a wireless charger,</text><text start="628.02" dur="0.93">then it won&amp;#39;t matter.</text><text start="628.95" dur="1.38">But I&amp;#39;ll be checking that out.</text><text start="630.33" dur="1.8">But then we arrived.</text><text start="632.13" dur="0.93">They did all the sections</text><text start="633.06" dur="1.47">with all the other operating systems,</text><text start="634.53" dur="1.23">and now we got to the part</text><text start="635.76" dur="4.08">where Apple&amp;#39;s gonna talk
about AI stuff, kind of.</text><text start="639.84" dur="0.87">Now, I don&amp;#39;t know if you remember this,</text><text start="640.71" dur="2.04">but a couple months
ago, not that long ago,</text><text start="642.75" dur="2.91">I did an entire video
on all of these phrases</text><text start="645.66" dur="4.02">that it seems like Apple
refused to say on stage.</text><text start="649.68" dur="1.41">They just would not say &amp;#39;em,</text><text start="651.09" dur="2.4">and AI is one of them.</text><text start="653.49" dur="1.08">They just didn&amp;#39;t say it.</text><text start="654.57" dur="3.45">They&amp;#39;d say anything else,
neural nets, machine learning,</text><text start="658.02" dur="2.01">all sorts of other things like that,</text><text start="660.03" dur="1.05">But the times of the times,</text><text start="661.08" dur="2.64">people wanna hear Apple talk about AI.</text><text start="663.72" dur="1.59">So they finally did.</text><text start="665.31" dur="1.56">And they also, like I said,</text><text start="666.87" dur="2.37">they rebranded it just for themselves</text><text start="669.24" dur="3.63">to just commander the AI name.</text><text start="672.87" dur="3.36">And so now it&amp;#39;s called Apple
Intelligence in Apple Land.</text><text start="676.23" dur="1.29">So here&amp;#39;s basically what you need to know</text><text start="677.52" dur="1.2">about Apple Intelligence, right?</text><text start="678.72" dur="2.94">So Apple has already had AI features</text><text start="681.66" dur="1.14">on their devices before.</text><text start="682.8" dur="2.61">They&amp;#39;ve had the Neural
Engine inside of their chips,</text><text start="685.41" dur="1.95">and they&amp;#39;ve done things like,</text><text start="687.36" dur="1.89">smartly cutting subjects out of photos.</text><text start="689.25" dur="3.12">They&amp;#39;ve done things like auto
complete on the keyboard.</text><text start="692.37" dur="1.17">That&amp;#39;s already existed.</text><text start="693.54" dur="1.95">But this new Apple Intelligence</text><text start="695.49" dur="4.02">is basically a bucket of
these new generative models</text><text start="699.51" dur="1.44">and what they do on your devices.</text><text start="700.95" dur="2.97">So there&amp;#39;s these new diffusion models,</text><text start="703.92" dur="3.24">generative models, and
large language models</text><text start="707.16" dur="1.89">that are all built by Apple</text><text start="709.05" dur="3.42">that bring new functionality
to the supported devices.</text><text start="712.47" dur="1.14">And actually, I&amp;#39;ll just
get that out the way,</text><text start="713.61" dur="0.87">right off the bat.</text><text start="714.48" dur="1.56">These are only supported</text><text start="716.04" dur="1.53">on the highest end versions</text><text start="717.57" dur="1.86">of currently available Apple silicon.</text><text start="719.43" dur="4.35">So that just means iPhone 15 Pro</text><text start="723.78" dur="2.91">and any iPad with M1 or later</text><text start="726.69" dur="2.79">and any Mac with M1 or later.</text><text start="729.48" dur="1.77">So what does that look like?</text><text start="731.25" dur="2.4">Well, basically starting
with these new OSs,</text><text start="733.65" dur="2.37">there&amp;#39;s a small suite of tools</text><text start="736.02" dur="2.61">that&amp;#39;s kind of sprinkled
across everything.</text><text start="738.63" dur="0.87">It&amp;#39;s not like there&amp;#39;s one</text><text start="739.5" dur="1.86">Apple Intelligence app
or something like that.</text><text start="741.36" dur="1.86">They&amp;#39;re just kind of sprinkled throughout.</text><text start="743.22" dur="2.22">So here&amp;#39;s an example, writing tools.</text><text start="745.44" dur="3.9">We all know how powerful these
large language models can be.</text><text start="749.34" dur="2.91">So anytime you&amp;#39;re writing
in pages or keynote</text><text start="752.25" dur="2.16">or basically anywhere
where there&amp;#39;s a cursor,</text><text start="754.41" dur="3.3">you can use the writing tools to summarize</text><text start="757.71" dur="2.49">or rewrite something that
you&amp;#39;ve already written.</text><text start="760.2" dur="2.55">It can change the writing
style or just proofread,</text><text start="762.75" dur="1.47">just basic useful stuff.</text><text start="764.22" dur="0.99">Here&amp;#39;s another one.</text><text start="765.21" dur="2.82">Remember the Magic Eraser
tool in Google Photos</text><text start="768.03" dur="1.74">and these Android phones that use it?</text><text start="769.77" dur="1.5">Apple&amp;#39;s finally doing that too.</text><text start="771.27" dur="3.03">Built into their own Photos
App is a Clean Up tool,</text><text start="774.3" dur="1.23">and it&amp;#39;s basically the same idea.</text><text start="775.53" dur="2.28">This will identify background items.</text><text start="777.81" dur="2.58">It&amp;#39;ll let you circle items
you don&amp;#39;t like in your photos</text><text start="780.39" dur="1.53">and just get rid of them.</text><text start="781.92" dur="2.67">Fill in the background with
generative fill, super quick.</text><text start="784.59" dur="5">And there&amp;#39;s also Genmojis,
generative emojis.</text><text start="789.6" dur="1.23">And this made me feel really old</text><text start="790.83" dur="1.2">&amp;#39;cause I would never use this,</text><text start="792.03" dur="2.04">but apparently there&amp;#39;s
a whole group of people</text><text start="794.07" dur="2.04">who go through searching for emojis</text><text start="796.11" dur="2.22">and then they find that
there&amp;#39;s one that doesn&amp;#39;t exist,</text><text start="798.33" dur="3.48">and they&amp;#39;re like, &amp;quot;Dang, I
wish I could just make an emoji</text><text start="801.81" dur="1.407">for this moment right now.&amp;quot;</text><text start="804.06" dur="2.58">And for those people, yeah, now you can.</text><text start="806.64" dur="1.53">You can generate a new emoji,</text><text start="808.17" dur="2.13">You can literally type
it in like a prompt,</text><text start="810.3" dur="1.92">and the diffusion model will create</text><text start="812.22" dur="2.01">that new emoji from scratch</text><text start="814.23" dur="1.92">in the style of all the other emojis.</text><text start="816.15" dur="3.21">And they had an entire thing
called the Image Playground</text><text start="819.36" dur="1.95">that&amp;#39;s built into a bunch of Apples apps,</text><text start="821.31" dur="1.56">but also has its own separate app</text><text start="822.87" dur="3">that lets you create these
nice little square images</text><text start="825.87" dur="2.64">with prompts in three different styles,</text><text start="828.51" dur="3.33">sketch, illustration, and animation.</text><text start="831.84" dur="1.83">And yes, there are also Siri improvements</text><text start="833.67" dur="1.95">that&amp;#39;s using the large language models</text><text start="835.62" dur="2.73">to generally understand context better</text><text start="838.35" dur="4.23">and just generally be
better and more natural at</text><text start="842.58" dur="1.5">being an assistant that isn&amp;#39;t garbage.</text><text start="844.08" dur="1.68">And later in the year,
it will also be able to</text><text start="845.76" dur="2.4">pull info from inside of apps</text><text start="848.16" dur="2.94">and take actions inside
of apps for you too.</text><text start="851.1" dur="2.94">I remember when this
was a huge Bixby feature</text><text start="854.04" dur="1.65">on Samsung phones.</text><text start="855.69" dur="1.11">So that&amp;#39;s cool to see.</text><text start="856.8" dur="2.13">Plus there&amp;#39;s also this big pretty new</text><text start="858.93" dur="2.22">full-screen animation when
you&amp;#39;re triggering Siri</text><text start="861.15" dur="1.35">to tie it all together.</text><text start="862.5" dur="2.187">Its voice is apparently slightly updated</text><text start="864.687" dur="2.613">and you can now also type to Siri</text><text start="867.3" dur="1.83">instead of talking to
it out loud every time,</text><text start="869.13" dur="2.43">which is long overdue, but also nice.</text><text start="871.56" dur="1.56">There is notes app summaries,</text><text start="873.12" dur="1.59">there is phone call summaries,</text><text start="874.71" dur="4.38">just all kinds of features
sprinkled around like I said.</text><text start="879.09" dur="1.26">I think I&amp;#39;ll end up making a video</text><text start="880.35" dur="2.52">just summarizing or testing or reviewing</text><text start="882.87" dur="2.61">all of the Apple Intelligence stuff</text><text start="885.48" dur="2.64">&amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s kind of all over the place,</text><text start="888.12" dur="0.84">but now you know what it&amp;#39;s.</text><text start="888.96" dur="0.833">But one question that&amp;#39;s been</text><text start="889.793" dur="1.207">floating around the internet is,</text><text start="891" dur="3.33">what stuff is happening on device</text><text start="894.33" dur="3.42">versus things that have
to go to the cloud?</text><text start="897.75" dur="1.71">And this has also come up a lot</text><text start="899.46" dur="1.83">because you might have
also heard about Apple</text><text start="901.29" dur="2.37">partnering specifically with OpenAI</text><text start="903.66" dur="5">to integrate ChatGPT-4.0 into
this Apple Intelligence stuff.</text><text start="909.75" dur="1.41">So it&amp;#39;s a big question
everyone&amp;#39;s wondering.</text><text start="911.16" dur="2.337">So I got the official answers from Apple,</text><text start="913.497" dur="2.253">and the answer is basically</text><text start="915.75" dur="3.33">almost everything happens
on device intentionally,</text><text start="919.08" dur="1.53">and those are from Apple built models,</text><text start="920.61" dur="3.09">so that should be the
fastest stuff that happens.</text><text start="923.7" dur="3.15">But in the chance that there
are things that are too complex</text><text start="926.85" dur="4.26">or just outside of the area of
expertise of Apple&amp;#39;s models,</text><text start="931.11" dur="2.43">then it can basically go one of two ways.</text><text start="933.54" dur="3.72">One is it will go to a
larger server based model</text><text start="937.26" dur="2.46">that&amp;#39;s on servers that Apple has built</text><text start="939.72" dur="1.62">with Apple silicon</text><text start="941.34" dur="2.55">using what they call
Private Cloud Compute.</text><text start="943.89" dur="3.36">So basically the info is
never stored or sent to Apple.</text><text start="947.25" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s still gonna have the downsides of</text><text start="948.93" dur="2.25">having to go off of the
device up to the cloud.</text><text start="951.18" dur="1.2">It might take a bit longer</text><text start="952.38" dur="1.59">if you&amp;#39;re in an area
with terrible internet.</text><text start="953.97" dur="1.5">It might not work at all,</text><text start="955.47" dur="2.82">but in the chance that this
is like a big complex thing</text><text start="958.29" dur="1.8">that could benefit from those models,</text><text start="960.09" dur="1.11">that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;ll try to do.</text><text start="961.2" dur="2.31">But the other is when you
specifically ask it for something</text><text start="963.51" dur="2.94">that ChatGPT would be good at.</text><text start="966.45" dur="3.157">And if that happens, then it
will specifically ask you,</text><text start="969.607" dur="4.703">&amp;quot;Hey, is it cool if I ask chat GPT</text><text start="974.31" dur="1.32">for an answer to this question?&amp;quot;</text><text start="975.63" dur="2.88">And then you can give it
a yes or no on the spot.</text><text start="978.51" dur="1.5">So anytime it wants to do this,</text><text start="980.01" dur="1.65">whether it&amp;#39;s to upload a photo</text><text start="981.66" dur="1.47">that you&amp;#39;re asking something about</text><text start="983.13" dur="1.86">or just do a complex prompt in general,</text><text start="984.99" dur="1.62">then this little dialogue box pops up</text><text start="986.61" dur="2.1">and you have to say yes every time,</text><text start="988.71" dur="2.31">and then you can tap into everything</text><text start="991.02" dur="2.1">that OpenAI&amp;#39;s model is capable of,</text><text start="993.12" dur="2.49">or generate even more realistic or varied,</text><text start="995.61" dur="2.07">random different styles of images</text><text start="997.68" dur="2.16">that Apple&amp;#39;s diffusion
models would never make.</text><text start="999.84" dur="2.55">This is all free without an account.</text><text start="1002.39" dur="2.37">At no point is OpenAI allowed to</text><text start="1004.76" dur="1.65">ever store any of these requests,</text><text start="1006.41" dur="1.5">and Apple has also said that they will</text><text start="1007.91" dur="1.17">obscure your IP address.</text><text start="1009.08" dur="1.38">So you can&amp;#39;t even...</text><text start="1010.46" dur="3.54">OpenAI can&amp;#39;t even connect
multiple requests together</text><text start="1014" dur="1.26">to form a profile of you.</text><text start="1015.26" dur="2.67">There&amp;#39;s just a lot of
thought that&amp;#39;s gone into</text><text start="1017.93" dur="3.39">ideally making this as secure
and private of a version</text><text start="1021.32" dur="3.06">of going to the cloud for AI
features as they possibly can.</text><text start="1024.38" dur="0.93">So yeah, it&amp;#39;s really interesting,</text><text start="1025.31" dur="1.98">a lot of interesting stuff going on here.</text><text start="1027.29" dur="2.4">I think my overall take with</text><text start="1029.69" dur="2.31">a lot of this WWDC announcements</text><text start="1032" dur="2.223">and with the Apple Intelligence stuff,</text><text start="1035.33" dur="5">first of all, is that the
Humane Pin and the Rabbit R1,</text><text start="1041.66" dur="2.34">they were so doomed from the start.</text><text start="1044" dur="2.43">Even if they were good up to this point,</text><text start="1046.43" dur="3.03">there&amp;#39;s just no way
they could be as good as</text><text start="1049.46" dur="2.79">this stuff on your phone
with all the personalization,</text><text start="1052.25" dur="1.8">all the info that they
already know about you.</text><text start="1054.05" dur="2.04">So I guess that&amp;#39;s confirmed,</text><text start="1056.09" dur="2.01">but also it does feel like</text><text start="1058.1" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;ve entered a new age with Apple.</text><text start="1061.28" dur="4.14">I think the AI stuff is so
important that it very much is</text><text start="1065.42" dur="2.04">what we&amp;#39;re most interested
in and it overshadows.</text><text start="1067.46" dur="2.58">Honestly, what could
possibly be your favorite</text><text start="1070.04" dur="3.003">non-AI feature from
the past couple things?</text><text start="1073.94" dur="2.34">Moving home screen apps
and icons everywhere,</text><text start="1076.28" dur="1.77">that might be the biggest thing,</text><text start="1078.05" dur="2.73">but it&amp;#39;s up to this point now all about</text><text start="1080.78" dur="3.06">what this intelligence stuff
can actually do for you</text><text start="1083.84" dur="0.833">and what it can bring you.</text><text start="1084.673" dur="1.477">So that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m really excited about.</text><text start="1086.15" dur="1.68">I&amp;#39;ll be working on some videos very soon</text><text start="1087.83" dur="0.833">about a lot of this stuff.</text><text start="1088.663" dur="1.447">So definitely, like I said, get subscribed</text><text start="1090.11" dur="1.32">if you haven&amp;#39;t already,</text><text start="1091.43" dur="3.12">but this has been your overview
or what you need to know.</text><text start="1094.55" dur="1.62">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="1096.17" dur="1.5">Catch you guys in the next one.</text><text start="1097.67" dur="0.932">Peace.</text><text start="1098.602" dur="2.583">(gentle music)</text></transcript>
