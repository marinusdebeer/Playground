<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="1.95">- All right, so you
like me, might have seen</text><text start="1.95" dur="2.61">a lot of Formula 1 recently,</text><text start="4.56" dur="2.19">a lot of races, a lot of famous drivers,</text><text start="6.75" dur="2.1">a lot of drama and exciting stories.</text><text start="8.85" dur="2.73">It&amp;#39;s taken over my timeline
on Twitter many times.</text><text start="11.58" dur="1.41">Basically, a ton of you guys
have been saying it to me,</text><text start="12.99" dur="1.38">asking, &amp;quot;Hey, are you watching?</text><text start="14.37" dur="1.68">Are you paying attention to this stuff?&amp;quot;</text><text start="16.05" dur="3.84">And so I finally caved and
I&amp;#39;ve started watching it</text><text start="19.89" dur="1.08">and I&amp;#39;m really glad I did.</text><text start="20.97" dur="2.07">So in this video, I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you guys</text><text start="23.04" dur="3.6">why I think Formula 1 is super
cool, why I started watching,</text><text start="26.64" dur="2.13">and why you should probably
be watching Formula 1 too.</text><text start="28.77" dur="4.02">From the stories to the
tech, to the innovation,</text><text start="32.79" dur="1.893">to the race-day experiences.</text><text start="35.58" dur="1.133">This is Formula 1 explained.</text><text start="38.555" dur="2.695">(mellow music)</text><text start="41.25" dur="1.68">So shout out to sponsor Bitdefender</text><text start="42.93" dur="1.47">for making this video possible.</text><text start="44.4" dur="2.85">They reached out because they
are a Ferrari team partner,</text><text start="47.25" dur="2.52">so they&amp;#39;re on the Ferrari
car and the helmet</text><text start="49.77" dur="1.98">and they have a lot of
parallels in the tech world</text><text start="51.75" dur="1.47">with cybersecurity and safety</text><text start="53.22" dur="1.29">so we&amp;#39;ll talk more about that in a minute.</text><text start="54.51" dur="3.03">But for now, I&amp;#39;m so glad that
y&amp;#39;all put this on my radar</text><text start="57.54" dur="1.83">because I love it now,</text><text start="59.37" dur="3.75">just because while on the
surface it is just a car race,</text><text start="63.12" dur="3.69">which is already pretty cool,
it is also, at the same time,</text><text start="66.81" dur="4.08">the world&amp;#39;s highest-end tech competition.</text><text start="70.89" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s a science fair.</text><text start="71.723" dur="1.387">So at the most basic level,</text><text start="73.11" dur="2.88">the sport is a year-long
season of car races</text><text start="75.99" dur="1.68">on different tracks around the world.</text><text start="77.67" dur="2.1">And Formula 1 has a long and rich history.</text><text start="79.77" dur="1.74">I don&amp;#39;t need to give you a
whole history lesson here,</text><text start="81.51" dur="2.88">but there&amp;#39;s been a
massive amount of changes</text><text start="84.39" dur="1.89">going from stuff like this,</text><text start="86.28" dur="3.42">like a pretty simple looking
tube with an engine and wheels,</text><text start="89.7" dur="3.36">to this aerodynamic work of art</text><text start="93.06" dur="2.34">made from the most advanced
materials on the planet.</text><text start="95.4" dur="3.66">But the most interesting
part about F1 that I love</text><text start="99.06" dur="2.73">is that there are
actually two championships</text><text start="101.79" dur="2.13">at the same time, each season.</text><text start="103.92" dur="1.89">There&amp;#39;s the Drivers&amp;#39; Championship</text><text start="105.81" dur="2.52">and the Constructors&amp;#39; Championship.</text><text start="108.33" dur="1.65">So yes, every driver is gonna try</text><text start="109.98" dur="1.83">to get around the track
as fast as possible,</text><text start="111.81" dur="1.38">but the structure is:</text><text start="113.19" dur="2.79">there are 10 teams, each
team has two active drivers.</text><text start="115.98" dur="2.4">And so every race, a driver can get points</text><text start="118.38" dur="1.26">for how high they finish.</text><text start="119.64" dur="2.28">Those add up at the end of
the season to get a winner.</text><text start="121.92" dur="1.41">But there&amp;#39;s also points</text><text start="123.33" dur="2.88">for the engineering teams behind each car.</text><text start="126.21" dur="2.37">And they also get points that add up</text><text start="128.58" dur="1.62">to a championship at the end of the year.</text><text start="130.2" dur="1.92">And this, this is what I mean</text><text start="132.12" dur="1.74">when I say it&amp;#39;s a science fair.</text><text start="133.86" dur="2.85">&amp;#39;Cause look, every sport has rules, right?</text><text start="136.71" dur="3.12">Like golf, all your clubs need
to be within a certain spec</text><text start="139.83" dur="3.03">and the basketball hoop
is standardized, right?</text><text start="142.86" dur="2.91">But having the best equipment in F1</text><text start="145.77" dur="3.06">is incredibly advantageous,
as you might suspect,</text><text start="148.83" dur="2.7">and you&amp;#39;re allowed,
actually, encouraged even,</text><text start="151.53" dur="3.87">to improve your equipment
between every single race.</text><text start="155.4" dur="2.1">You are constantly
working on your equipment.</text><text start="157.5" dur="1.35">In so many ways</text><text start="158.85" dur="3.51">F1 is the sport with
the most tech involved.</text><text start="162.36" dur="3">Like these teams are spending
millions and millions,</text><text start="165.36" dur="3.78">hundreds of millions of
dollars to find/invent</text><text start="169.14" dur="2.4">any little improvement
that they can come up with</text><text start="171.54" dur="3">to give themselves the
edge every single week.</text><text start="174.54" dur="3.24">They&amp;#39;re fighting for tenths
and hundredths of a second.</text><text start="177.78" dur="1.08">It&amp;#39;s incredible to see.</text><text start="178.86" dur="2.16">Like, you don&amp;#39;t get from here</text><text start="181.02" dur="2.34">to here so quickly by accident.</text><text start="183.36" dur="2.91">There is a massive amount of engineering</text><text start="186.27" dur="2.07">and experimenting that
goes into optimizing</text><text start="188.34" dur="2.76">every single little part of every car</text><text start="191.1" dur="1.5">to be able to get around the track</text><text start="192.6" dur="2.16">as fast as physically possible,</text><text start="194.76" dur="2.04">to get as many points for the championship</text><text start="196.8" dur="2.37">every season within the rules.</text><text start="199.17" dur="1.56">And yes, there are still rules.</text><text start="200.73" dur="0.833">This is important.</text><text start="201.563" dur="3.337">So the FIA is the governing
body in charge of F1</text><text start="204.9" dur="2.85">and they are charged
with the impossible task</text><text start="207.75" dur="1.41">of maintaining a set of rules</text><text start="209.16" dur="2.73">that keeps everything fair and safe,</text><text start="211.89" dur="2.04">but still allows room for</text><text start="213.93" dur="3.33">and encourages innovation
and tweaking things.</text><text start="217.26" dur="1.98">So you can actually look
up the rule book yourself.</text><text start="219.24" dur="2.58">There&amp;#39;s a 183-page PDF online.</text><text start="221.82" dur="1.05">I&amp;#39;ll leave a link below the like button</text><text start="222.87" dur="1.23">if you wanna flip through it yourself.</text><text start="224.1" dur="1.92">And there are so many
interesting rules in here,</text><text start="226.02" dur="2.58">some of them to keep racing
strategies interesting,</text><text start="228.6" dur="2.22">like the requirement
that every single driver</text><text start="230.82" dur="2.88">uses at least two different
tire compounds during the race.</text><text start="233.7" dur="0.99">I&amp;#39;ll explain that in a minute.</text><text start="234.69" dur="1.8">There are also plenty
of safety-related rules,</text><text start="236.49" dur="1.95">which, again, is why a
company like Bitdefender</text><text start="238.44" dur="1.2">really makes sense to be here.</text><text start="239.64" dur="2.91">So these are open-wheel,
open-cockpit race cars,</text><text start="242.55" dur="2.16">but every single one
of them, as you&amp;#39;ll see,</text><text start="244.71" dur="3.54">no matter what, has this
iron-reinforced ring</text><text start="248.25" dur="3.39">around and above the
driver&amp;#39;s head called a halo.</text><text start="251.64" dur="1.59">This thing is not designed by the teams.</text><text start="253.23" dur="2.52">This is designed by the
FIA and the teams get them</text><text start="255.75" dur="1.56">from one of the approved manufacturers</text><text start="257.31" dur="1.89">and they have to put them on their car.</text><text start="259.2" dur="1.32">There was initially some pushback</text><text start="260.52" dur="0.99">against the aesthetics of it,</text><text start="261.51" dur="3.36">but every single year since
its introduction in 2018,</text><text start="264.87" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s continued to prove its
worth in the safety department.</text><text start="267.87" dur="1.98">Like, you can literally
go watch race footage</text><text start="269.85" dur="2.7">of incidents where the halo saves lives</text><text start="272.55" dur="1.8">since it can literally support the weight</text><text start="274.35" dur="2.31">of another entire car on top of you,</text><text start="276.66" dur="1.89">or if it gets flipped upside down.</text><text start="278.55" dur="1.47">So you can bet that&amp;#39;s why Bitdefender</text><text start="280.02" dur="3.18">wanted their logo specifically on the halo</text><text start="283.2" dur="1.62">of the Team Ferrari car.</text><text start="284.82" dur="1.89">So Bitdefender is a
leader in cybersecurity,</text><text start="286.71" dur="2.73">which means they value innovation, safety,</text><text start="289.44" dur="3.39">and quick reactions, which
is tied right into F1.</text><text start="292.83" dur="2.19">So you can see why it makes
sense for Bitdefender&amp;#39;s logo</text><text start="295.02" dur="3.09">to be on the most important
safety features of the cars.</text><text start="298.11" dur="1.92">They&amp;#39;re also on the
helmet too, by the way.</text><text start="300.03" dur="1.02">There&amp;#39;s some other high-level rules</text><text start="301.05" dur="2.88">around the turbocharged
V6 engines they all use</text><text start="303.93" dur="1.83">and the gear boxes, et cetera.</text><text start="305.76" dur="3.57">My personal favorite
and funniest rule to me</text><text start="309.33" dur="1.29">is also one of the oldest,</text><text start="310.62" dur="3.51">which is under every single F1 car</text><text start="314.13" dur="2.19">is a plank of wood bolted to the bottom</text><text start="316.32" dur="2.79">because one of the OG rules is to restrict</text><text start="319.11" dur="3.27">just how low the car can
ride, another safety thing.</text><text start="322.38" dur="3.21">And so after every race they can inspect</text><text start="325.59" dur="1.98">the plank of wood on
the bottom of your car</text><text start="327.57" dur="2.25">and if it&amp;#39;s too worn down,</text><text start="329.82" dur="2.1">then your car was dragging
too low to the ground</text><text start="331.92" dur="1.08">and you have too much down force</text><text start="333" dur="2.04">and your car is illegal, disqualified.</text><text start="335.04" dur="0.833">So just think about that.</text><text start="335.873" dur="2.467">Next time you see one
of those jet-looking,</text><text start="338.34" dur="3.03">marvel-of-engineering
carbon fiber masterpieces</text><text start="341.37" dur="1.02">flying around the racetrack,</text><text start="342.39" dur="1.77">just know that every single one of them</text><text start="344.16" dur="2.94">also has a plank of wood
bolted to the bottom of it.</text><text start="347.1" dur="2.73">So you&amp;#39;ve got this rule book,
everybody knows the rules,</text><text start="349.83" dur="2.37">and then you&amp;#39;ve got all these
teams independently working,</text><text start="352.2" dur="2.97">spending millions of dollars
to try to find any experiment,</text><text start="355.17" dur="2.64">any little thing that might give their car</text><text start="357.81" dur="2.07">the advantage around the track.</text><text start="359.88" dur="1.98">And naturally, since it&amp;#39;s so competitive,</text><text start="361.86" dur="2.25">these teams are incredibly secretive</text><text start="364.11" dur="1.17">about everything they&amp;#39;re doing.</text><text start="365.28" dur="1.5">But then, the beautiful thing is</text><text start="366.78" dur="2.43">if some team actually
comes up with something</text><text start="369.21" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s good enough to give
them a real advantage,</text><text start="372.42" dur="3.18">even if it&amp;#39;s a tenth of a
second, a quarter of a second,</text><text start="375.6" dur="2.883">a half a second per lap, that&amp;#39;s massive,</text><text start="379.32" dur="3.12">eventually, all of the other
teams will pick up on it</text><text start="382.44" dur="1.77">and will find a way to build it</text><text start="384.21" dur="1.41">and implement it themselves.</text><text start="385.62" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s just this ecosystem</text><text start="387.3" dur="1.41">of all these constantly-improving features</text><text start="388.71" dur="1.89">and you can see them
stacking on top of each other</text><text start="390.6" dur="0.833">over and over again.</text><text start="391.433" dur="1.777">&amp;quot;So what exactly are these improvements?&amp;quot;,</text><text start="393.21" dur="1.47">you might be wondering.</text><text start="394.68" dur="2.22">Great question. Here are
some of the biggest ones.</text><text start="396.9" dur="1.38">And basically every single one of these</text><text start="398.28" dur="1.59">has an amazing story behind it</text><text start="399.87" dur="2.61">of how someone on an
engineering team had an idea</text><text start="402.48" dur="1.65">and then they decided to try it</text><text start="404.13" dur="1.92">and then it worked and it stuck.</text><text start="406.05" dur="2.07">So one of the most obvious
is the wings, right?</text><text start="408.12" dur="3.36">Of course we see wings
everywhere on today&amp;#39;s cars,</text><text start="411.48" dur="2.85">but believe it or not, F1
cars didn&amp;#39;t always have wings.</text><text start="414.33" dur="2.46">They just relied on pure
mechanical grip from the tires.</text><text start="416.79" dur="1.35">But you know how if you stick your hand</text><text start="418.14" dur="1.53">out the car window and then tilt it,</text><text start="419.67" dur="2.16">it&amp;#39;ll push your hand up or down.</text><text start="421.83" dur="1.68">Same thing with a wing on a car.</text><text start="423.51" dur="3.39">It can push parts of the car
up or down into the track</text><text start="426.9" dur="2.16">for more grip and faster cornering.</text><text start="429.06" dur="2.19">So it started off as a
very small experiment</text><text start="431.25" dur="3">on the front axle and, very
quickly, it started working</text><text start="434.25" dur="2.7">and now they all have
front wings and rear wings.</text><text start="436.95" dur="2.28">Fun fact, one team did actually once try</text><text start="439.23" dur="3.06">a mini extra front wing on a car in 2001.</text><text start="442.29" dur="1.02">It didn&amp;#39;t really work out</text><text start="443.31" dur="2.22">so you don&amp;#39;t really see
that anymore. (chuckles)</text><text start="445.53" dur="3.93">The cars today have tons and
tons of aerodynamic features:</text><text start="449.46" dur="4.23">multi-layered front wings,
small air-steering little bits,</text><text start="453.69" dur="1.71">like fins near the middle of the car.</text><text start="455.4" dur="2.52">It&amp;#39;s crazy how many details there are</text><text start="457.92" dur="2.73">if you ever actually get to
look at one of these things.</text><text start="460.65" dur="3.75">Another huge advancement
is something called KERS,</text><text start="464.4" dur="2.88">an acronym for kinetic
energy recovery system.</text><text start="467.28" dur="2.01">Basically, a system to capture energy</text><text start="469.29" dur="1.71">created by the spinning wheel</text><text start="471" dur="2.31">and turns it into energy in a battery</text><text start="473.31" dur="2.16">that can be deployed as boosts later.</text><text start="475.47" dur="2.28">So the first teams to
try this kind of stuff,</text><text start="477.75" dur="1.92">they actually found it
was a little bit too heavy</text><text start="479.67" dur="1.89">and it worked kind of sometimes,</text><text start="481.56" dur="2.34">didn&amp;#39;t necessarily guarantee a win.</text><text start="483.9" dur="2.07">But eventually, fast
forward a couple years,</text><text start="485.97" dur="1.26">and it&amp;#39;s developed over time</text><text start="487.23" dur="2.94">and paved the way for
today&amp;#39;s hybrid F1 cars.</text><text start="490.17" dur="2.73">Now, you might&amp;#39;ve also
heard of this one, DRS.</text><text start="492.9" dur="2.16">This one&amp;#39;s pretty simple actually.</text><text start="495.06" dur="1.53">So yeah, there&amp;#39;s a ton of downforce</text><text start="496.59" dur="1.68">from the aerodynamic features of this car</text><text start="498.27" dur="1.98">and that helps it stick to the ground</text><text start="500.25" dur="1.59">during these planted turns,</text><text start="501.84" dur="2.04">but that actually, technically,</text><text start="503.88" dur="2.04">slows it down in a straight line.</text><text start="505.92" dur="3.42">So teams engineered a
drag reduction system,</text><text start="509.34" dur="3.12">a button that you press that
changes the aero of the car,</text><text start="512.46" dur="2.31">opens up, lets it cut
through the air more quickly,</text><text start="514.77" dur="1.86">and it works really well.</text><text start="516.63" dur="2.61">So at this point, not only
do all the cars have it,</text><text start="519.24" dur="2.01">but it&amp;#39;s actually literally
written into the rules</text><text start="521.25" dur="3.03">when you can use it to
maximize racing excitement.</text><text start="524.28" dur="0.833">There have been plenty</text><text start="525.113" dur="2.977">of other massive technological
innovations over the years</text><text start="528.09" dur="2.55">that have all been pioneered
by just some engineer on a team</text><text start="530.64" dur="2.4">who had a good idea that
have turned out to be huge,</text><text start="533.04" dur="2.76">from putting the engine behind the driver,</text><text start="535.8" dur="1.86">to the monocoque chassis,</text><text start="537.66" dur="2.82">to the ground-effect
aerodynamics, to paddle shifters,</text><text start="540.48" dur="1.05">all of them adding up</text><text start="541.53" dur="5">to absolutely insane
cars of today in 2023.</text><text start="546.81" dur="4.14">These cars are clawing for
maximum grip around every corner.</text><text start="550.95" dur="3.69">They&amp;#39;re hitting 200+ mile
an hour in straightaways</text><text start="554.64" dur="5">and then pulling five to six
Gs under breaking and turning.</text><text start="559.98" dur="4.8">Five to six Gs is about as much</text><text start="564.78" dur="3.18">as you can feel anywhere on
earth other than an airplane.</text><text start="567.96" dur="1.02">So this is why F1</text><text start="568.98" dur="2.37">is often called &amp;quot;the
pinnacle of motorsports,&amp;quot;</text><text start="571.35" dur="0.87">and I totally agree.</text><text start="572.22" dur="3">Like there are technically cars
that are a little bit faster</text><text start="575.22" dur="2.1">in a straight line from a standstill.</text><text start="577.32" dur="1.56">You might see some of
these videos on YouTube.</text><text start="578.88" dur="3.09">My car actually is, but the
second you get to a turn,</text><text start="581.97" dur="3.12">it gets really obvious
the difference in braking,</text><text start="585.09" dur="2.46">grip, acceleration out of a corner,</text><text start="587.55" dur="1.53">just the control you have over the car.</text><text start="589.08" dur="1.8">It&amp;#39;s honestly incredible.</text><text start="590.88" dur="2.52">And it&amp;#39;s one thing to see it on TV,</text><text start="593.4" dur="1.74">like you can tell
they&amp;#39;re going pretty fast</text><text start="595.14" dur="1.83">and the broadcasts are super cool.</text><text start="596.97" dur="1.8">There&amp;#39;s sensor data everywhere,</text><text start="598.77" dur="3.39">live speed readouts, cameras on every car,</text><text start="602.16" dur="2.91">but seeing it in-person</text><text start="605.07" dur="3.36">gave me an entirely new level
of respect for all of it.</text><text start="608.43" dur="2.22">So this is the Ferrari car</text><text start="610.65" dur="1.44">the day before racing started</text><text start="612.09" dur="1.77">this past weekend in Las Vegas.</text><text start="613.86" dur="2.55">This car is so much lower</text><text start="616.41" dur="2.85">and actually bigger than
you might expect it to be.</text><text start="619.26" dur="4.23">There was also so many little
aerodynamic shapes and pieces</text><text start="623.49" dur="2.76">and carbon fiber everywhere,
as I mentioned before.</text><text start="626.25" dur="2.19">The tires are also gigantic</text><text start="628.44" dur="2.94">and the driver sits so much
lower than you might expect.</text><text start="631.38" dur="3.96">Actually, Bitdefender also let
me try a full-on F1 simulator</text><text start="635.34" dur="1.65">in their Performance
Zone out here in Vegas.</text><text start="636.99" dur="1.98">And the most noticeable thing, actually,</text><text start="638.97" dur="1.59">is just how low you sit.</text><text start="640.56" dur="1.74">Your feet are kind of back up in the air</text><text start="642.3" dur="1.02">right below eye level,</text><text start="643.32" dur="2.07">which is where the pedals are in the car.</text><text start="645.39" dur="1.89">It&amp;#39;s just funny picturing
all the drivers now</text><text start="647.28" dur="1.38">in their cars like this.</text><text start="648.66" dur="4.83">But what really got me is just
seeing how fast they move.</text><text start="653.49" dur="2.28">Cameras just don&amp;#39;t do
it justice, I promise.</text><text start="655.77" dur="2.37">It&amp;#39;s really, really impressive stuff.</text><text start="658.14" dur="3.87">And then, there&amp;#39;s obviously
the noise and the smells</text><text start="662.01" dur="2.19">and the vibration through your chest,</text><text start="664.2" dur="2.04">like none of that happens
through the broadcast.</text><text start="666.24" dur="2.31">So when Bitdefender reached
out and offered to get me</text><text start="668.55" dur="3.03">to the Las Vegas Grand Prix
to help make this video,</text><text start="671.58" dur="1.56">I couldn&amp;#39;t say no.</text><text start="673.14" dur="3.6">So this is the second-to-last
race of this 2023 F1 season,</text><text start="676.74" dur="2.94">a super cool race built
into the city of Las Vegas.</text><text start="679.68" dur="0.93">Like one of the straightaways</text><text start="680.61" dur="2.22">is literally the Las Vegas strip</text><text start="682.83" dur="2.58">and points are available for
the Drivers&amp;#39; Championship</text><text start="685.41" dur="1.86">and the Constructors&amp;#39; Championship.</text><text start="687.27" dur="4.11">So what is a race day
experience actually like?</text><text start="691.38" dur="0.99">Well, here&amp;#39;s what to look out for.</text><text start="692.37" dur="1.68">So first of all, an F1 Grand Prix</text><text start="694.05" dur="2.58">is actually a several-days-long event.</text><text start="696.63" dur="4.35">First, there&amp;#39;s practice days,
then there&amp;#39;s a qualifying day,</text><text start="700.98" dur="1.41">then there&amp;#39;s the race day.</text><text start="702.39" dur="1.59">So the practice day is actually</text><text start="703.98" dur="2.1">just a fascinating thing
to watch on its own</text><text start="706.08" dur="2.79">because it&amp;#39;s a practice
for both the drivers</text><text start="708.87" dur="2.01">and the teams engineering the cars.</text><text start="710.88" dur="2.25">So there&amp;#39;s a set amount of
time that these teams get</text><text start="713.13" dur="1.68">to send the drivers out in their cars</text><text start="714.81" dur="3.6">to see how much faster or
slower certain setups are.</text><text start="718.41" dur="1.83">They all go flying
around the track at once</text><text start="720.24" dur="1.2">for the first time</text><text start="721.44" dur="1.71">and drivers will literally communicate</text><text start="723.15" dur="1.95">with their teams from
a radio in their helmet</text><text start="725.1" dur="1.357">about how things are feeling.</text><text start="726.457" dur="2.093">&amp;quot;Oh, you know, a little more
down force here would be nice.</text><text start="728.55" dur="1.83">A little more stiffness
here would be nice.&amp;quot;</text><text start="730.38" dur="3.18">So they might do a quick
pit stop to swap out,</text><text start="733.56" dur="2.67">not just a different set of
tires to see how those feel,</text><text start="736.23" dur="2.1">but they might completely
bring it back into the garage</text><text start="738.33" dur="2.64">and tweak some of the entire car setup</text><text start="740.97" dur="2.1">before they bring it
back out for another lap</text><text start="743.07" dur="2.16">and try out some more major adjustments,</text><text start="745.23" dur="1.17">all within the rules, of course.</text><text start="746.4" dur="0.93">You might have seen the headlines,</text><text start="747.33" dur="4.11">this Las Vegas one, the practice
day got a bit interrupted</text><text start="751.44" dur="4.8">because one of the cars went
over a manhole cover so fast</text><text start="756.24" dur="3.33">that the ground effect
aerodynamic force from the car</text><text start="759.57" dur="3.12">sucked the manhole cover out
of the hole in the ground</text><text start="762.69" dur="1.68">and damaged the car.</text><text start="764.37" dur="1.11">And so they had to go around</text><text start="765.48" dur="2.58">and weld all of the manhole covers shut.</text><text start="768.06" dur="0.833">Pretty insane.</text><text start="768.893" dur="2.047">So then the next night is
one more practice session</text><text start="770.94" dur="2.07">and then qualifying.</text><text start="773.01" dur="2.19">So qualifying is actually pretty simple.</text><text start="775.2" dur="3.21">It&amp;#39;s go out and set your
absolute fastest lap time</text><text start="778.41" dur="1.23">with your car.</text><text start="779.64" dur="1.83">Whoever has the fastest lap time</text><text start="781.47" dur="2.25">will start the race in first place</text><text start="783.72" dur="1.71">and whoever has the slowest lap time</text><text start="785.43" dur="1.05">will start in last place.</text><text start="786.48" dur="1.53">So even this gets pretty exciting</text><text start="788.01" dur="2.25">because once again,
everyone is out here now</text><text start="790.26" dur="3.27">trying to set their qualifying
lap as fast as possible</text><text start="793.53" dur="1.38">and they&amp;#39;re all trying at once</text><text start="794.91" dur="1.5">so sometimes there&amp;#39;s a little traffic</text><text start="796.41" dur="1.41">or a little bit of drama,</text><text start="797.82" dur="2.43">and there&amp;#39;s actually
three qualifying sessions</text><text start="800.25" dur="1.77">in a row, elimination style.</text><text start="802.02" dur="1.8">So you start with 20 drivers.</text><text start="803.82" dur="2.4">The first session
eliminates the slowest five,</text><text start="806.22" dur="2.07">the second session, which
is a little shorter,</text><text start="808.29" dur="1.83">eliminates the next slowest five,</text><text start="810.12" dur="1.89">and then the third and final session</text><text start="812.01" dur="3.99">is the top 10 fastest laps
in order from 1 through 10.</text><text start="816" dur="0.96">And so everyone is after</text><text start="816.96" dur="4.29">that precious first spot on
the grid, aka pole position.</text><text start="821.25" dur="1.47">I think the real-time, all the data,</text><text start="822.72" dur="1.05">I went down to the garage</text><text start="823.77" dur="1.92">when they were starting qualifying,</text><text start="825.69" dur="1.59">those guys are looking at monitors</text><text start="827.28" dur="3.27">with everything about the car in real time</text><text start="830.55" dur="3.63">as it&amp;#39;s driving on a graph,
being traced on a screen.</text><text start="834.18" dur="2.46">It&amp;#39;s sick. It&amp;#39;s a science fair.</text><text start="836.64" dur="1.71">So there&amp;#39;s no screens out here
so you kinda have to follow,</text><text start="838.35" dur="2.16">like, on the app, you can
only see the finish line,</text><text start="840.51" dur="3.183">but final qualifying,
Ferrari one, Ferrari two.</text><text start="844.8" dur="2.22">I didn&amp;#39;t plan that, they&amp;#39;re just fast.</text><text start="847.02" dur="3.15">So then, the third and
final day of the Grand Prix</text><text start="850.17" dur="1.35">is the race.</text><text start="851.52" dur="2.31">And a lot of people will not get to go</text><text start="853.83" dur="3.9">to an F1 race in person,
but it is really intense.</text><text start="857.73" dur="1.74">Like they&amp;#39;re all dialed in now.</text><text start="859.47" dur="1.92">They&amp;#39;re all rolling
out their absolute best</text><text start="861.39" dur="2.37">and final version of
the science fair project</text><text start="863.76" dur="1.29">with their best pilots</text><text start="865.05" dur="1.95">and they&amp;#39;re all gonna now
pit &amp;#39;em against each other.</text><text start="867" dur="1.77">So a race is typically about 90 minutes.</text><text start="868.77" dur="3.51">It&amp;#39;s always 190 miles,
in this case, 50 laps.</text><text start="872.28" dur="1.77">And if you&amp;#39;re doing the math in your head,</text><text start="874.05" dur="1.77">yes, that does mean they&amp;#39;re averaging</text><text start="875.82" dur="3.42">well over a hundred miles
an hour for the entire race,</text><text start="879.24" dur="1.29">pit stops included.</text><text start="880.53" dur="2.52">But then, actually one
key thing to look out for</text><text start="883.05" dur="3.51">while you&amp;#39;re watching the
race is pit stop strategy.</text><text start="886.56" dur="3.99">So most pit stops during
an F1 race are super quick,</text><text start="890.55" dur="3.24">two to four seconds, and
it&amp;#39;s mostly just tires.</text><text start="893.79" dur="0.833">Now, they are capable</text><text start="894.623" dur="2.677">of doing some more extensive
repairs during pit stops,</text><text start="897.3" dur="2.22">but those also definitely take longer.</text><text start="899.52" dur="2.34">So sometimes if you have like
a damaged wing or something,</text><text start="901.86" dur="2.07">they&amp;#39;ll just continue on with it</text><text start="903.93" dur="2.43">because it&amp;#39;s faster to
not actually replace it.</text><text start="906.36" dur="2.243">The winner of the race this
week actually did that.</text><text start="908.603" dur="2.197">And so one of the last biggest rules in F1</text><text start="910.8" dur="3.42">that I haven&amp;#39;t even mentioned
yet, amazingly, is the tires.</text><text start="914.22" dur="2.07">So there&amp;#39;s a predefined set of tires</text><text start="916.29" dur="2.97">available to all of the
cars that are, again,</text><text start="919.26" dur="1.08">not designed by the teams.</text><text start="920.34" dur="2.64">They&amp;#39;re spec&amp;#39;d by the FIA under the rules</text><text start="922.98" dur="2.01">to be exciting for racing.</text><text start="924.99" dur="2.1">And basically, there is a set of them</text><text start="927.09" dur="2.85">ranging from softest and grippiest</text><text start="929.94" dur="3.03">all the way to hardest and most durable</text><text start="932.97" dur="1.23">depending on the rubber compound.</text><text start="934.2" dur="3.63">So the softest tires are
gonna be by far the grippiest</text><text start="937.83" dur="1.47">and fastest around the track.</text><text start="939.3" dur="2.73">They can be good for a few
seconds faster per lap,</text><text start="942.03" dur="2.1">but believe it or not, they&amp;#39;re so soft</text><text start="944.13" dur="2.76">that they will wear
down incredibly quickly</text><text start="946.89" dur="3">and can be completely
cooked in 10 to 20 laps</text><text start="949.89" dur="1.95">and so you will need to do a pit stop,</text><text start="951.84" dur="1.74">which will cost you a little bit of time.</text><text start="953.58" dur="1.38">But then, the hardest compounds</text><text start="954.96" dur="3.33">are technically slower per lap, less grip,</text><text start="958.29" dur="3.12">but they can go way more
laps without a pit stop.</text><text start="961.41" dur="2.34">So these drivers are not
only jockeying for position</text><text start="963.75" dur="1.08">to drive their best,</text><text start="964.83" dur="4.17">but teams are also putting
together pit stop strategies</text><text start="969" dur="3.33">because every car is
required by the rules to use</text><text start="972.33" dur="3.78">at least two different tire
compounds during the race,</text><text start="976.11" dur="2.79">which produces a lot of
really fascinating scenarios</text><text start="978.9" dur="2.55">where one driver is ending the race</text><text start="981.45" dur="1.8">with a different set
of tires than another,</text><text start="983.25" dur="1.2">depending on their strategy.</text><text start="984.45" dur="2.73">It is wild. It&amp;#39;s super
interesting to watch.</text><text start="987.18" dur="2.64">It&amp;#39;s like chess, but the pieces are moving</text><text start="989.82" dur="2.64">at 200 miles an hour and
curves and everything.</text><text start="992.46" dur="0.9">It&amp;#39;s amazing.</text><text start="993.36" dur="1.53">It&amp;#39;s another reason why Bitdefender</text><text start="994.89" dur="1.77">aligns itself so well with this stuff</text><text start="996.66" dur="2.37">because again, they&amp;#39;re a
leader in cybersecurity.</text><text start="999.03" dur="2.76">In cybersecurity, you have to respond,</text><text start="1001.79" dur="1.53">you have a strategy to start things,</text><text start="1003.32" dur="1.44">but things can go very wrong</text><text start="1004.76" dur="2.25">and so they have to be
able to adapt in real time.</text><text start="1007.01" dur="2.31">And that&amp;#39;s a lot of the same
things these drivers are doing,</text><text start="1009.32" dur="1.35">that these teams are doing.</text><text start="1010.67" dur="2.1">When strategies fall apart,
they gotta tweak things,</text><text start="1012.77" dur="2.31">they gotta adjust, they gotta edit.</text><text start="1015.08" dur="1.2">It&amp;#39;s very complicated.</text><text start="1016.28" dur="2.97">So there&amp;#39;s all this
technology, all this strategy,</text><text start="1019.25" dur="1.47">all of these incredible machines.</text><text start="1020.72" dur="1.71">But at the end of the day,</text><text start="1022.43" dur="3.18">you just gotta get out there
and win the race, you know?</text><text start="1025.61" dur="3.03">So get in the slipstream, play defense,</text><text start="1028.64" dur="1.38">attack braking zones,</text><text start="1030.02" dur="2.91">use your machine&amp;#39;s specific advantages</text><text start="1032.93" dur="1.65">to get that rare overtake</text><text start="1034.58" dur="2.52">and just all of this being put together,</text><text start="1037.1" dur="1.2">it&amp;#39;s like art on wheels.</text><text start="1038.3" dur="1.89">There&amp;#39;s plenty of YouTube clips out there.</text><text start="1040.19" dur="3.06">There&amp;#39;s a Netflix documentary
you&amp;#39;ve probably heard about.</text><text start="1043.25" dur="1.38">It is amazing to watch.</text><text start="1044.63" dur="3.69">And then the cherry on top
for me is all of the effects</text><text start="1048.32" dur="4.65">that Formula 1 has on the
world outside of Formula 1.</text><text start="1052.97" dur="1.02">It&amp;#39;s bigger than you might think.</text><text start="1053.99" dur="1.56">Like the obvious one is that, okay,</text><text start="1055.55" dur="2.34">some of the highest-end,
most amazing innovations</text><text start="1057.89" dur="2.64">from trying to make the F1 cars faster</text><text start="1060.53" dur="1.83">will eventually maybe trickle down</text><text start="1062.36" dur="1.74">into the road cars that we have today.</text><text start="1064.1" dur="1.23">And that&amp;#39;s true, that&amp;#39;s real.</text><text start="1065.33" dur="1.74">So the Ferrari team
might find something cool</text><text start="1067.07" dur="2.37">that works on the racetrack in 2023,</text><text start="1069.44" dur="2.49">and then in 2029, they&amp;#39;re working on</text><text start="1071.93" dur="2.07">a simpler, less expensive version,</text><text start="1074" dur="1.74">but that&amp;#39;s very effective for a Ferrari</text><text start="1075.74" dur="1.35">that someone can actually buy.</text><text start="1077.09" dur="3.24">DRS, paddle shifters, carbon fiber,</text><text start="1080.33" dur="1.26">there&amp;#39;s lots of examples of things</text><text start="1081.59" dur="1.74">that originated in F1 cars</text><text start="1083.33" dur="1.8">that have made their way
to cars that exist today,</text><text start="1085.13" dur="0.833">which is super cool.</text><text start="1085.963" dur="1.387">But then there&amp;#39;s some of
the less obvious things</text><text start="1087.35" dur="5">like a race kind of changes
a whole city forever,</text><text start="1092.63" dur="1.08">kind of like the Olympics.</text><text start="1093.71" dur="1.2">Now, a lot of races are on</text><text start="1094.91" dur="1.83">dedicated purpose-built racetracks,</text><text start="1096.74" dur="1.05">so the effect&amp;#39;s not as huge,</text><text start="1097.79" dur="2.43">but there are a few special
races during the season</text><text start="1100.22" dur="3">that are built into the city streets,</text><text start="1103.22" dur="2.55">which are way cooler, in my opinion,</text><text start="1105.77" dur="2.37">even if they present a number
of very unique challenges.</text><text start="1108.14" dur="3.39">And then the winning, or
even just participating,</text><text start="1111.53" dur="3.84">is a huge marketing win
for all of these companies.</text><text start="1115.37" dur="2.67">Obviously, if you have a team dedicated</text><text start="1118.04" dur="1.92">to the highest end of motorsport</text><text start="1119.96" dur="4.08">pushing the envelope with
innovation and engineering,</text><text start="1124.04" dur="1.68">the ad copy basically writes itself.</text><text start="1125.72" dur="2.49">So thanks again to
Bitdefender and Team Ferrari</text><text start="1128.21" dur="2.07">for helping make this video possible.</text><text start="1130.28" dur="2.16">I got to learn a lot about them too.</text><text start="1132.44" dur="2.13">And actually the fact that
Bitdefender technology</text><text start="1134.57" dur="1.68">is actually used by Ferrari</text><text start="1136.25" dur="2.1">to protect their top-secret innovations.</text><text start="1138.35" dur="4.05">But now I&amp;#39;m a fan, I&amp;#39;m
gonna be watching F1.</text><text start="1142.4" dur="1.5">I hope you enjoyed this video.</text><text start="1143.9" dur="1.53">My goal for this whole thing was</text><text start="1145.43" dur="2.85">to hopefully have you be
able to watch a video,</text><text start="1148.28" dur="1.11">watch an F1 race,</text><text start="1149.39" dur="2.28">and not necessarily know
everything that&amp;#39;s going on,</text><text start="1151.67" dur="3.03">but to be able to better
appreciate the race</text><text start="1154.7" dur="2.4">and the engineering and the spectacle</text><text start="1157.1" dur="2.114">of what might happen next.</text><text start="1159.214" dur="1.036">(mellow music)</text><text start="1160.25" dur="3.03">Thanks for watching.
