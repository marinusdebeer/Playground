<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="3.66">(energetic electronic music)</text><text start="3.66" dur="4.2">- All right, so this is a crypto phone.</text><text start="7.86" dur="1.627">And I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking,</text><text start="9.487" dur="1.703">&amp;quot;What the hell is a crypto phone,</text><text start="11.19" dur="2.76">and why would anyone want that?&amp;quot;</text><text start="13.95" dur="1.68">And that&amp;#39;s exactly what I was thinking</text><text start="15.63" dur="1.41">when this first crossed my radar.</text><text start="17.04" dur="2.46">So this is an upper,
mid-range Android phone,</text><text start="19.5" dur="2.07">with crazy material choices,</text><text start="21.57" dur="1.83">from a brand you&amp;#39;ve never heard of,</text><text start="23.4" dur="3.72">with some specific
crypto features built in,</text><text start="27.12" dur="2.64">that launched at a thousand dollars.</text><text start="29.76" dur="4.2">Now, I know I have been notably skeptical</text><text start="33.96" dur="4.86">on crypto and Web3 and
blockchain and the Metaverse</text><text start="38.82" dur="1.5">and all that sort of stuff
over the past couple years,</text><text start="40.32" dur="2.52">so you may consider me biased,</text><text start="42.84" dur="5">but I still think if you took
the crypto out of this phone,</text><text start="48.96" dur="2.4">it would at least have potential.</text><text start="51.36" dur="0.99">I&amp;#39;m serious.</text><text start="52.35" dur="0.833">Let me explain.</text><text start="53.183" dur="2.077">So the story of this phone
actually starts all the way back</text><text start="55.26" dur="1.53">with the Essential Phone.</text><text start="56.79" dur="1.14">So I don&amp;#39;t know how many y&amp;#39;all remember</text><text start="57.93" dur="2.13">the Essential Phone back in 2017,</text><text start="60.06" dur="2.13">but that was a really interesting</text><text start="62.19" dur="2.85">and exciting new development
in the smartphone world.</text><text start="65.04" dur="2.1">We don&amp;#39;t get that many
genuinely promising,</text><text start="67.14" dur="3.24">new phone companies coming
along and doing good things,</text><text start="70.38" dur="2.28">but that&amp;#39;s exactly what
this Andy Rubin startup</text><text start="72.66" dur="2.67">was promising when they came
out with their first phone.</text><text start="75.33" dur="3.27">It was just this refreshing
sort of minimal design.</text><text start="78.6" dur="2.04">There were no protruding camera bumps,</text><text start="80.64" dur="2.01">no big logos or branding.</text><text start="82.65" dur="2.7">They were one of the first
to do this camera notch here,</text><text start="85.35" dur="1.98">at the top of the screen,
with the thin bezels,</text><text start="87.33" dur="2.04">and they were one of the only ones</text><text start="89.37" dur="2.43">using these super premium materials,</text><text start="91.8" dur="3.84">the titanium rails and
polished ceramic on the back,</text><text start="95.64" dur="1.59">and then it just had some pins on the back</text><text start="97.23" dur="3.3">with some magnets for attaching
some modular accessories,</text><text start="100.53" dur="2.64">just some genuinely
interesting, really cool ideas</text><text start="103.17" dur="2.85">on top of some super clean software.</text><text start="106.02" dur="3.75">Now, unfortunately, this
experiment didn&amp;#39;t really catch on.</text><text start="109.77" dur="3.36">You know, this unfortunate
combination of high price,</text><text start="113.13" dur="3.48">mediocre cameras, not that
strong of a feature set</text><text start="116.61" dur="1.26">for regular people to care,</text><text start="117.87" dur="1.92">launching as a Sprint exclusive,</text><text start="119.79" dur="4.11">all of this led to extremely low sales.</text><text start="123.9" dur="2.28">And then the company would
go on to dynamite itself</text><text start="126.18" dur="2.64">after a bunch of info
about Andy Rubin comes out.</text><text start="128.82" dur="3.24">And so we would not get
to see a second try,</text><text start="132.06" dur="1.23">an Essential Phone 2.</text><text start="133.29" dur="2.73">Now, it sucks to see a promising company</text><text start="136.02" dur="3.18">with a ton of talent
just disappear like that,</text><text start="139.2" dur="1.62">but something that happens a lot,</text><text start="140.82" dur="2.73">a lot of times when these
businesses dissolve,</text><text start="143.55" dur="2.19">is the teams that worked on stuff</text><text start="145.74" dur="3.03">sometimes will pop up somewhere else,</text><text start="148.77" dur="1.08">and work on something else.</text><text start="149.85" dur="1.86">And so sure enough, in 2020,</text><text start="151.71" dur="2.64">a bunch of the engineers from
the original Essential team</text><text start="154.35" dur="4.38">got back together to form
a new company, called OSOM,</text><text start="158.73" dur="3.57">and they would announce their
first project, the OSOM OV1,</text><text start="162.3" dur="2.85">basically the spiritual
successor to the Essential Phone,</text><text start="165.15" dur="3.48">and you can see a lot of
similarities and continuity</text><text start="168.63" dur="1.2">in this announcement.</text><text start="169.83" dur="2.1">They talked about these
crazy materials again,</text><text start="171.93" dur="1.95">this titanium and polished ceramic,</text><text start="173.88" dur="1.95">and the rectangular design,</text><text start="175.83" dur="2.43">but they also, then tried to
correct a bunch of the things</text><text start="178.26" dur="1.77">that doomed the original Essential Phone.</text><text start="180.03" dur="2.79">It is noticeably bigger,
and with a bigger screen,</text><text start="182.82" dur="1.38">bigger battery, et cetera.</text><text start="184.2" dur="3.21">But shocker, they didn&amp;#39;t
really get enough interest</text><text start="187.41" dur="2.07">in this brand new startup phone</text><text start="189.48" dur="2.43">to be able to bring this
whole idea back to life.</text><text start="191.91" dur="2.31">It&amp;#39;s the classic enthusiast phone problem</text><text start="194.22" dur="1.08">where like it&amp;#39;s a cool idea,</text><text start="195.3" dur="1.71">and some people really, really want it,</text><text start="197.01" dur="1.35">but there&amp;#39;s not enough hype</text><text start="198.36" dur="2.1">to be able to make the whole thing happen.</text><text start="201.42" dur="2.37">That is until Solana came along.</text><text start="203.79" dur="4.05">So Solana is a Web3 company
looking for new projects</text><text start="207.84" dur="2.787">and OSOM is this hardware team</text><text start="210.627" dur="3.393">looking for some backing
to make this phone happen.</text><text start="214.02" dur="3.21">So Solana would bring the
cash and bring their backing.</text><text start="217.23" dur="1.41">OSOM would bring their hardware talent</text><text start="218.64" dur="2.7">and they&amp;#39;d partnered
together to turn the OV1</text><text start="221.34" dur="4.62">into this rebranded
Solana Saga, crypto phone.</text><text start="225.96" dur="3.063">And it would be a thousand dollars.</text><text start="229.92" dur="3.03">And that&amp;#39;s this phone right here.</text><text start="232.95" dur="1.29">So all right, where do we start?</text><text start="234.24" dur="4.53">There&amp;#39;s basically three things
that make this a crypto phone</text><text start="238.77" dur="2.06">instead of just another
regular Android phone.</text><text start="240.83" dur="2.2">So the Solana Mobile Stack,</text><text start="243.03" dur="3.21">the Seed Vault and the Dapp store</text><text start="246.24" dur="1.71">so okay, outside of those things,</text><text start="247.95" dur="2.58">this OV1 or the Solana phone</text><text start="250.53" dur="2.19">is actually a very average Android phone.</text><text start="252.72" dur="2.97">Like specs wise, it&amp;#39;s a
Snapdragon 8+, gen one,</text><text start="255.69" dur="2.01">so that would be last
year&amp;#39;s flagship chip,</text><text start="257.7" dur="2.58">but then 12 gigs of RAM and
half a terabyte of storage,</text><text start="260.28" dur="2.43">although it&amp;#39;s unclear
if it&amp;#39;s fast UFS 3.1,</text><text start="262.71" dur="5">but it&amp;#39;s a nice big 6.67 inch
flat 1080p 120 hertz display,</text><text start="268.26" dur="1.89">at the front, that gets decently bright,</text><text start="270.15" dur="3.81">but it is not LTPO, it&amp;#39;s
just a fixed refresh rate,</text><text start="273.96" dur="2.88">and then it&amp;#39;s powered by a
4,100 milliamp hour battery</text><text start="276.84" dur="1.62">with wireless charging.</text><text start="278.46" dur="3.63">Not great for the size of
this screen, but not tiny.</text><text start="282.09" dur="2.46">And then it&amp;#39;s IP 68
water and dust resistant</text><text start="284.55" dur="3.12">with a micro SD card slot
for storage expansion.</text><text start="287.67" dur="3.36">But then a pair of really
mediocre cameras on the back.</text><text start="291.03" dur="2.82">It&amp;#39;s got the same 50
megapixel main camera sensor</text><text start="293.85" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s in the ROG Phone 7
and the Oppo Find X5 pro,</text><text start="297.84" dur="1.47">but with worse software,</text><text start="299.31" dur="3.06">and that&amp;#39;s paired with a 12
megapixel ultra-wide camera,</text><text start="302.37" dur="2.49">both of which can pretty much only produce</text><text start="304.86" dur="1.05">in perfect lighting,</text><text start="305.91" dur="2.28">after which things fall apart very quickly</text><text start="308.19" dur="2.46">with a lack of detail, excessive noise,</text><text start="310.65" dur="2.1">just no really impressive strengths,</text><text start="312.75" dur="2.46">just a really very heavily mixed bag here.</text><text start="315.21" dur="2.46">But there are two things about this phone</text><text start="317.67" dur="2.37">that actually I&amp;#39;m very impressed by,</text><text start="320.04" dur="2.07">that I really like, okay?</text><text start="322.11" dur="2.58">Number one is the materials again,</text><text start="324.69" dur="1.95">just this world class build quality,</text><text start="326.64" dur="2.64">because like I said, it&amp;#39;s
basically the same team,</text><text start="329.28" dur="1.74">the awesome OV1 team,</text><text start="331.02" dur="2.37">that came from the
original Essential Phone.</text><text start="333.39" dur="1.56">And so they have this affinity</text><text start="334.95" dur="1.44">for super high quality materials.</text><text start="336.39" dur="3.15">So we&amp;#39;re talking matte
stainless steel frame</text><text start="339.54" dur="4.08">with colored titanium buttons
and a full ceramic back,</text><text start="343.62" dur="1.71">which yes, picks up
fingerprints everywhere,</text><text start="345.33" dur="1.08">other than the fingerprint reader,</text><text start="346.41" dur="1.86">but dude, this phone is a tank.</text><text start="348.27" dur="2.13">This phone is also very heavy.</text><text start="350.4" dur="1.98">It weighs like 250 grams,</text><text start="352.38" dur="2.34">which is more than an iPhone 14 Pro Max.</text><text start="354.72" dur="2.4">It&amp;#39;s got these nice squared
off sides, that I really like.</text><text start="357.12" dur="5">There&amp;#39;s absolutely no squeaking,
creaking, flexing at all.</text><text start="362.25" dur="3.57">It&amp;#39;s just this hilariously,
well-made packaging</text><text start="365.82" dur="1.53">of these average specs.</text><text start="367.35" dur="1.74">But then two, the other
thing I really like,</text><text start="369.09" dur="2.34">aside from the crypto
stuff, the software itself,</text><text start="371.43" dur="3.84">once you get into it, is
actually extremely clean,</text><text start="375.27" dur="1.56">very clean, like stock Android.</text><text start="376.83" dur="1.44">So it is Android 13,</text><text start="378.27" dur="2.73">and who knows when it&amp;#39;ll
get Android 14 if at all,</text><text start="381" dur="1.92">but you can dig through everything</text><text start="382.92" dur="3.81">and it is very quick and
responsive and clean everywhere.</text><text start="386.73" dur="2.04">It&amp;#39;s the stock Android quick settings,</text><text start="388.77" dur="3.18">the stock Android wallpaper
and customization screens,</text><text start="391.95" dur="1.41">all these stock Google apps,</text><text start="393.36" dur="2.7">the clock, the calendar,
Chrome, everything.</text><text start="396.06" dur="5">Now, does any of this justify
a thousand dollar price tag?</text><text start="401.253" dur="1.017">(exhales) Okay, well, let&amp;#39;s see,</text><text start="402.27" dur="2.61">ot&amp;#39;s got last year&amp;#39;s flagship spec,</text><text start="404.88" dur="2.67">kind of weak cameras, weak battery,</text><text start="407.55" dur="2.25">not that amazing of a screen,</text><text start="409.8" dur="2.43">but it&amp;#39;s stock Android and good build,</text><text start="412.23" dur="1.71">not really worth a thousand bucks, right?</text><text start="413.94" dur="2.07">So that&amp;#39;s why literally less
than a year after it came out,</text><text start="416.01" dur="4.26">the price plummeted
from a thousand to $600.</text><text start="420.27" dur="2.61">So now the real question is would you pay,</text><text start="422.88" dur="4.8">would anybody pay $600 for
a barely above average,</text><text start="427.68" dur="1.41">well-built, Android phone</text><text start="429.09" dur="3.063">that happens to have some
crypto features built in?</text><text start="433.623" dur="2.907">(sighs) I guess this is the
part where I have to go over</text><text start="436.53" dur="2.22">all of the crypto and web3 features.</text><text start="438.75" dur="1.86">So all right, like I mentioned earlier,</text><text start="440.61" dur="3.12">there&amp;#39;s three things that
make this a crypto phone.</text><text start="443.73" dur="2.07">So the Solana Mobile Stack is an SDK</text><text start="445.8" dur="3.03">for apps to connect to
this Solana blockchain,</text><text start="448.83" dur="2.07">which I mean, it&amp;#39;s cool
that it&amp;#39;s built in,</text><text start="450.9" dur="2.58">but the obvious downside
being this does not work</text><text start="453.48" dur="1.83">with any other blockchain.</text><text start="455.31" dur="3.99">So no Bitcoin, no Litecoin, no Ethereum,</text><text start="459.3" dur="3.57">this is just focused on
the Solana blockchain.</text><text start="462.87" dur="3.03">Then the seed vault is
basically dedicated storage</text><text start="465.9" dur="3.81">of a 24 phrase seed, stored
in a secure environment,</text><text start="469.71" dur="2.16">where the Android OS cannot see them,</text><text start="471.87" dur="1.74">so that would let you unlock your wallet,</text><text start="473.61" dur="0.87">and then the last feature</text><text start="474.48" dur="2.25">is something I&amp;#39;ve been
calling a D app store,</text><text start="476.73" dur="3.33">which is literally a second
app store on this device</text><text start="480.06" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s specifically for crypto
apps, crypto focused stuff.</text><text start="484.32" dur="2.37">So Phantom Wallet is on here,</text><text start="486.69" dur="2.25">OKX, a crypto exchange is on here,</text><text start="488.94" dur="2.28">Brave Browser, things like that.</text><text start="491.22" dur="1.44">There&amp;#39;s an app called Minty Fresh</text><text start="492.66" dur="2.73">that lets you turn photos
from your camera roll</text><text start="495.39" dur="3.24">into NFTs in a few
seconds and a few clicks,</text><text start="498.63" dur="1.83">if you&amp;#39;re into that I guess.</text><text start="500.46" dur="1.38">But those are the only three things</text><text start="501.84" dur="2.7">that really make this a crypto phone,</text><text start="504.54" dur="1.74">and one of &amp;#39;em, the Dapp store,</text><text start="506.28" dur="1.14">is not really even that special</text><text start="507.42" dur="1.83">because it is coming to other phones</text><text start="509.25" dur="2.31">and you&amp;#39;ll be able to get
it on a non crypto phone.</text><text start="511.56" dur="1.32">So there&amp;#39;s that too.</text><text start="512.88" dur="0.93">Now, the other stuff,</text><text start="513.81" dur="1.62">I think you can actually make an argument.</text><text start="515.43" dur="2.97">is really, really cool to
have built into the phone</text><text start="518.4" dur="1.8">and actually secure like that.</text><text start="520.2" dur="3.03">And if you are in the Solana ecosystem,</text><text start="523.23" dur="2.73">this is the only place
you can get that stuff.</text><text start="525.96" dur="4.048">But man, I feel like
that&amp;#39;s about the most niche</text><text start="530.008" dur="1.412">(laughs) feature possible.</text><text start="531.42" dur="1.8">Like remember we were just
talking about the Zenfone 10,</text><text start="533.22" dur="3.45">how I love that phone,
it&amp;#39;s a super great phone.</text><text start="536.67" dur="1.35">It&amp;#39;s just a shame it won&amp;#39;t sell</text><text start="538.02" dur="3.96">because not as many
people like small phones.</text><text start="541.98" dur="2.01">Do you think the number of people,</text><text start="543.99" dur="4.68">who are in the Solana ecosystem
and want to buy a phone</text><text start="548.67" dur="2.613">that has some of those features built in,</text><text start="552.15" dur="3.33">is greater than or less
than the number of people</text><text start="555.48" dur="1.44">who want a small phone?</text><text start="556.92" dur="0.833">Basically,</text><text start="557.753" dur="2.167">the number one coolest thing
to come outta this project,</text><text start="559.92" dur="2.61">to me, is exposing me to
this thing right here,</text><text start="562.53" dur="3.09">which is the cable that comes
in the box for this phone.</text><text start="565.62" dur="2.67">This is a braided USBC, a USBC cable,</text><text start="568.29" dur="1.41">but not just any cable.</text><text start="569.7" dur="3.21">At the end here is a hard
switch that blocks all data</text><text start="572.91" dur="1.86">and only lets power through,</text><text start="574.77" dur="1.77">just making it a charging cable,</text><text start="576.54" dur="1.38">and that&amp;#39;s actually pretty sick,</text><text start="577.92" dur="1.62">highly effective for preventing</text><text start="579.54" dur="1.74">something called juice jacking attacks</text><text start="581.28" dur="2.76">where if you plug into, like
a public outlet somewhere,</text><text start="584.04" dur="1.77">but that outlet is malicious</text><text start="585.81" dur="2.28">and is gonna try to upload
malware to your device</text><text start="588.09" dur="2.07">or download photos or something,</text><text start="590.16" dur="3.18">this cable will not let that
happen, just blocks all data.</text><text start="593.34" dur="2.07">So if you&amp;#39;re plugging
into an extremely rare,</text><text start="595.41" dur="1.86">public USBC port, (laughs)</text><text start="597.27" dur="2.52">this is actually a great tool to have,</text><text start="599.79" dur="1.26">but it&amp;#39;s also not that special</text><text start="601.05" dur="2.13">and it&amp;#39;s available on
Amazon for like 30 bucks,</text><text start="603.18" dur="1.35">so I&amp;#39;ll also link that below.</text><text start="604.53" dur="2.79">So at this point, I don&amp;#39;t
even have to really tell you,</text><text start="607.32" dur="3.48">but the crypto phone is basically</text><text start="610.8" dur="4.95">a pretty standard Android phone
with a couple kind of cool,</text><text start="615.75" dur="3.18">but extremely niche crypto features</text><text start="618.93" dur="3.54">for one specific crypto stack,</text><text start="622.47" dur="2.64">one that happens to also
be tanking pretty hard</text><text start="625.11" dur="1.89">and has been tanking for months.</text><text start="627" dur="2.46">And I also don&amp;#39;t even
really have to tell you that</text><text start="629.46" dur="1.62">there&amp;#39;s basically no reason</text><text start="631.08" dur="3.21">for 99.99% of people to buy this.</text><text start="634.29" dur="2.43">Even if you were to try to buy this phone,</text><text start="636.72" dur="2.37">just for a nice clean stock Android phone,</text><text start="639.09" dur="2.79">and just totally ignore
all the crypto features,</text><text start="641.88" dur="2.04">you can get a lot more phone for 600 bucks</text><text start="643.92" dur="1.8">for the same price you could get a Pixel 7</text><text start="645.72" dur="2.4">or probably Pixel 8, by
the time it comes out.</text><text start="648.12" dur="3.93">You could get a refurbished Galaxy S 23.</text><text start="652.05" dur="2.4">You could get any number of 1+ phones.</text><text start="654.45" dur="2.49">I just don&amp;#39;t think this is
