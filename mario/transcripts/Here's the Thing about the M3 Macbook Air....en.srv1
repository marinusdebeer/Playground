<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.078" dur="3.192">(Intro music)</text><text start="3.27" dur="1.5">- That&amp;#39;s crazy that the
most interesting things</text><text start="4.77" dur="3.48">about this new laptop are
the reasons not to buy it.</text><text start="8.25" dur="2.1">So the MacBook Air just got refreshed.</text><text start="10.35" dur="3.78">It&amp;#39;s a pretty simple update,
maybe a boring one actually.</text><text start="14.13" dur="1.32">There&amp;#39;s really only two things new.</text><text start="15.45" dur="2.31">It has this new
anodization on the outside,</text><text start="17.76" dur="3.81">apparently a slightly more
fingerprint resistant look to it.</text><text start="21.57" dur="2.22">And it has the new M3 chip inside.</text><text start="23.79" dur="1.29">So the coating, I don&amp;#39;t know,</text><text start="25.08" dur="2.31">it barely makes a difference
if I&amp;#39;m being honest.</text><text start="27.39" dur="2.34">It still gets fingerprints
if you handle it regularly</text><text start="29.73" dur="1.41">without a skin or a case.</text><text start="31.14" dur="2.52">I would much rather depend
on something like a skin</text><text start="33.66" dur="1.29">from channel sponsor Dbrand.</text><text start="34.95" dur="1.71">It lets you break out
from one of the three</text><text start="36.66" dur="2.67">really simple colors and
it&amp;#39;s gonna hide fingerprints</text><text start="39.33" dur="2.61">a million times better than
any metal treatment ever could.</text><text start="41.94" dur="1.11">Plus these are real leather,</text><text start="43.05" dur="1.53">so they have a nice plush texture</text><text start="44.58" dur="1.2">and it&amp;#39;ll patina over time.</text><text start="45.78" dur="1.68">So I&amp;#39;ll leave a link to this one below.</text><text start="47.46" dur="2.82">But the other new thing
is this M3 chip inside.</text><text start="50.28" dur="3.54">So we&amp;#39;ve seen this M3 chip
before, this is what Apple does.</text><text start="53.82" dur="1.29">They put the same chip everywhere.</text><text start="55.11" dur="2.79">This came out in October of last year</text><text start="57.9" dur="2.1">and they immediately
put it in the new iMac.</text><text start="60" dur="2.04">And then we also got a new
MacBook Pro that launched</text><text start="62.04" dur="3.15">with this and the M3 PRO and the M3 Max.</text><text start="65.19" dur="4.23">So okay, new M3 Apple silicon,
third generation, great.</text><text start="69.42" dur="2.4">So now we&amp;#39;re finally getting
this new base M3 chip</text><text start="71.82" dur="4.5">in the new MacBook Air, side
note, why does it take so long?</text><text start="76.32" dur="2.46">I don&amp;#39;t know, it feels like
Apple kind of staggers it</text><text start="78.78" dur="3.6">probably on purpose, but like
it&amp;#39;s the same chip everywhere.</text><text start="82.38" dur="2.16">They&amp;#39;ve done the iMac,
they&amp;#39;ve done the MacBook Pro</text><text start="84.54" dur="3.36">and MacBook Air, but the
Mac Mini just staying</text><text start="87.9" dur="1.71">on M2, kind of weird.</text><text start="89.61" dur="2.91">Also the new iPad Pro still on M2.</text><text start="92.52" dur="1.11">When&amp;#39;s that gonna get it?</text><text start="93.63" dur="2.19">Anyway, you already know
that the MacBook Air</text><text start="95.82" dur="2.34">is the most popular Mac for a reason.</text><text start="98.16" dur="2.91">This is the base like entry level Mac</text><text start="101.07" dur="1.02">that most people are seeing</text><text start="102.09" dur="2.91">as the way to get into the Mac world.</text><text start="105" dur="2.16">And so the base MacBook
Air has typically been one</text><text start="107.16" dur="3.18">of the easiest to recommend
laptops in the world by design.</text><text start="110.34" dur="4.92">But this one, interestingly,
for two reasons, isn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="115.26" dur="2.52">Now, this has nothing to
do with performance of M3</text><text start="117.78" dur="1.11">or anything weird like that.</text><text start="118.89" dur="1.86">Like it&amp;#39;s the performance
you were expecting.</text><text start="120.75" dur="1.91">If you look at benchmarks,
it&amp;#39;s right around that 10</text><text start="122.66" dur="2.44">to 20% improvement over M2</text><text start="125.1" dur="1.23">depending on what you&amp;#39;re doing.</text><text start="126.33" dur="1.14">Definitely leans heavier</text><text start="127.47" dur="2.13">on graphics improvements this generation.</text><text start="129.6" dur="1.77">And there&amp;#39;s the rate tracing now finally.</text><text start="131.37" dur="1.02">So any applications</text><text start="132.39" dur="1.34">or rendering that are
taken advantage of that,</text><text start="133.73" dur="2.65">that&amp;#39;s gonna be a noticeable
improvement for M3.</text><text start="136.38" dur="1.77">And it&amp;#39;s clearly a more capable chip.</text><text start="138.15" dur="2.16">And also MacBook Airs,
especially the 15 inch,</text><text start="140.31" dur="2.82">just constantly get great
battery life across the board.</text><text start="143.13" dur="3.3">You also get now dual
external display support</text><text start="146.43" dur="1.5">with the lid closed,</text><text start="147.93" dur="2.4">but one external display
with the laptop open.</text><text start="150.33" dur="1.02">And it also appears</text><text start="151.35" dur="3.96">that the base storage
on M3 is much improved.</text><text start="155.31" dur="1.53">So this was one of those concerns from,</text><text start="156.84" dur="1.35">if you look back at M2,</text><text start="158.19" dur="2.37">you know obviously Apple seeds reviewers</text><text start="160.56" dur="2.82">with higher end MacBooks, so
most of us aren&amp;#39;t getting that.</text><text start="163.38" dur="1.47">But if you look back at M2</text><text start="164.85" dur="4.11">the base 256 gig model used
a single SSD module instead</text><text start="168.96" dur="1.11">of two SSDs.</text><text start="170.07" dur="3.42">Long story short, that
storage module was way slower</text><text start="173.49" dur="3.03">than M1, like 50% slower on paper.</text><text start="176.52" dur="2.34">Would you have noticed if nobody told you</text><text start="178.86" dur="2.19">and had never benchmarked it?</text><text start="181.05" dur="2.16">Maybe, possibly not,</text><text start="183.21" dur="2.91">but obviously it&amp;#39;s a bummer
having way slower storage</text><text start="186.12" dur="3.57">on a new M2 and that extra
time transferring large files,</text><text start="189.69" dur="0.99">that adds up over time.</text><text start="190.68" dur="2.85">So I&amp;#39;m happy to report that
I&amp;#39;ve seen really good benchmarks</text><text start="193.53" dur="3.06">on the base storage of the M3 Air.</text><text start="196.59" dur="2.28">It appears that they fixed it, awesome.</text><text start="198.87" dur="1.47">So what&amp;#39;s the deal with this M3 Air then?</text><text start="200.34" dur="1.44">Why am I saying it&amp;#39;s not necessarily</text><text start="201.78" dur="1.05">the best recommendation?</text><text start="202.83" dur="3.12">Well, historically, MacBook
Air has been super easy</text><text start="205.95" dur="2.64">to recommend, but with this M3,</text><text start="208.59" dur="4.05">they also lowered the price
of M2 by a hundred bucks</text><text start="212.64" dur="2.25">and discontinued the M1.</text><text start="214.89" dur="4.59">So now the lineup is M3
MacBook Air starts at 1099,</text><text start="219.48" dur="3.54">then M2 MacBook Air starts at 999</text><text start="223.02" dur="3.18">and then M1, it&amp;#39;s kind of gone from Apple,</text><text start="226.2" dur="1.47">but you can still find stock</text><text start="227.67" dur="2.4">that&amp;#39;s left at like Walmart or Best Buy.</text><text start="230.07" dur="2.76">Now the thing about the
MacBook Air being easy</text><text start="232.83" dur="2.58">to recommend is we&amp;#39;re
talking about regular people,</text><text start="235.41" dur="2.7">which it&amp;#39;s very light, regular,</text><text start="238.11" dur="3.75">normal usage like web browsing,
listening to music, a bunch</text><text start="241.86" dur="3.06">of tabs open, work stuff,
occasionally compiling</text><text start="244.92" dur="2.16">or rendering some small
things, photo editing</text><text start="247.08" dur="2.07">and chopping a video or two sometimes,</text><text start="249.15" dur="1.26">but really very light.</text><text start="250.41" dur="1.98">So these people, like type of people</text><text start="252.39" dur="4.772">who would buy a laptop at
Walmart would be totally fine</text><text start="257.162" dur="4.468">with the cheaper identical
looking MacBook Air</text><text start="261.63" dur="3.19">with the slightly slower
M2 chip and slower storage.</text><text start="264.82" dur="2.09">I think they would be totally fine.</text><text start="266.91" dur="2.19">But the other thing which
I need to talk about</text><text start="269.1" dur="2.94">is this whole base spec thing.</text><text start="272.04" dur="3.69">This is not exactly new to the
industry, but the base price</text><text start="275.73" dur="4.41">and the base spec has almost
become like this weird fallacy.</text><text start="280.14" dur="1.5">Like I think it was Linus who did a video</text><text start="281.64" dur="3.24">about how starting at is
like the biggest lie in tech.</text><text start="284.88" dur="1.74">And he&amp;#39;s right, it&amp;#39;s not just tech,</text><text start="286.62" dur="2.34">like the car industry
does it all the time too.</text><text start="288.96" dur="2.37">Starting at, you know,
this super low price,</text><text start="291.33" dur="2.16">but nobody actually gets it at that price.</text><text start="293.49" dur="2.88">You&amp;#39;re not gonna get a
totally bare base model car.</text><text start="296.37" dur="2.31">The base price is really
more to give you an idea</text><text start="298.68" dur="1.59">of how much you&amp;#39;re about to spend</text><text start="300.27" dur="2.76">when you actually option
it up the way you want to.</text><text start="303.03" dur="3.84">And the issue with these
is Apple&amp;#39;s markup prices</text><text start="306.87" dur="3.57">for above base spec is crazy high.</text><text start="310.44" dur="3.03">Like Apple charges way too much
for the most basic upgrades.</text><text start="313.47" dur="2.25">Obviously Apple Silicon
computers are all a system</text><text start="315.72" dur="2.37">on a chip, so they cannot be upgraded ever</text><text start="318.09" dur="1.32">after you buy them, right?</text><text start="319.41" dur="1.59">So once you buy it, you know, you&amp;#39;re kind</text><text start="321" dur="2.4">of incentivized if you&amp;#39;re
gonna keep it for a long time</text><text start="323.4" dur="1.32">to splurge a little bit</text><text start="324.72" dur="2.79">and give yourself some extra
headroom and future proof it</text><text start="327.51" dur="1.35">and bump up that spec.</text><text start="328.86" dur="2.94">But Apple charges so much
for bumping up that spec</text><text start="331.8" dur="2.981">that the base price feels
like kind of even more</text><text start="334.781" dur="1.609">of a lie than usual.</text><text start="336.39" dur="3.33">So the MacBook Air starts in 2024,</text><text start="339.72" dur="5">again, at eight gigs of shared
RAM and 256 gigs of storage.</text><text start="345.27" dur="2.64">Now, ignoring the fact that
the phone I&amp;#39;m using also has</text><text start="347.91" dur="1.17">more than eight gigs of RAM</text><text start="349.08" dur="4.68">and 256 gigs of storage, if
you want to upgrade to 16 gigs</text><text start="353.76" dur="4.38">of memory, the first available
RAM upgrade, that&amp;#39;s $200.</text><text start="358.14" dur="2.22">And if you wanna bump up
to just the half a terabyte</text><text start="360.36" dur="3.36">of storage, that&amp;#39;s
another 200 more dollars.</text><text start="363.72" dur="1.89">Compared to to how much
that actually costs Apple,</text><text start="365.61" dur="2.04">especially at the scale
that they&amp;#39;re operating,</text><text start="367.65" dur="2.88">that is just crazy,
brutal, ridiculous pricing.</text><text start="370.53" dur="2.22">So even if you do just that,</text><text start="372.75" dur="3.33">suddenly the MacBook Air M3 is $1,500.</text><text start="376.08" dur="2.28">So either you&amp;#39;re cool with
knowing you&amp;#39;re actually buying</text><text start="378.36" dur="4.332">a 1500 plus dollars MacBook
Air or the real question is,</text><text start="382.692" dur="4.938">is the base spec in 2024 actually usable?</text><text start="387.63" dur="5">And my take is actually
sometimes yes, sometimes yes.</text><text start="393.27" dur="1.74">So again, if you&amp;#39;re the
people I talked about earlier,</text><text start="395.01" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re buying a laptop
from the showcase at Walmart</text><text start="398.07" dur="2.76">or Best Buy, you just need
it to do the basic stuff</text><text start="400.83" dur="0.84">I mentioned earlier,</text><text start="401.67" dur="2.79">you actually can do that with eight gigs</text><text start="404.46" dur="1.8">of shared memory, no problem.</text><text start="406.26" dur="1.38">This might seem like a hot take,</text><text start="407.64" dur="2.01">but I&amp;#39;ve spent a lot of
time doing this stuff.</text><text start="409.65" dur="2.67">You rarely actually get
close to hitting the max</text><text start="412.32" dur="1.23">and hitting memory swap.</text><text start="413.55" dur="2.58">And even when you do,
it&amp;#39;s very much still fine.</text><text start="416.13" dur="2.88">It&amp;#39;s when you get into the
heavier stuff like media encoding</text><text start="419.01" dur="3.75">or exporting or gaming that
it&amp;#39;s a whole nother story.</text><text start="422.76" dur="1.62">So if you&amp;#39;re watching this video,</text><text start="424.38" dur="2.4">you already know which
group of people you&amp;#39;re in.</text><text start="426.78" dur="2.94">So for that massive group of
people who are doing a lot of</text><text start="429.72" dur="3.049">that normal, baseline computing stuff,</text><text start="432.769" dur="3.311">don&amp;#39;t buy the new M3 MacBook Air.</text><text start="436.08" dur="2.55">You can very easily get an M2 MacBook Air</text><text start="438.63" dur="1.05">and save your money.</text><text start="439.68" dur="3.36">Matter of fact, if you don&amp;#39;t
need the brighter display,</text><text start="443.04" dur="2.91">the MagSafe, the external display support,</text><text start="445.95" dur="2.01">which you probably don&amp;#39;t at this rate,</text><text start="447.96" dur="2.85">it&amp;#39;s also a great idea
to look into Best Buy</text><text start="450.81" dur="5">or Walmart&amp;#39;s like six,
$700 M1 MacBook Airs</text><text start="456.12" dur="0.833">that they&amp;#39;re selling right now.</text><text start="456.953" dur="2.527">I think Walmart first announced
they would have it for 699</text><text start="459.48" dur="1.98">and then a few days
later Best Buy announced</text><text start="461.46" dur="3.18">that they&amp;#39;d sell it for
649, which is pretty sick.</text><text start="464.64" dur="2.94">So clearly M3 is a much
more capable overall chip</text><text start="467.58" dur="1.65">and brings the floor of a laptop up.</text><text start="469.23" dur="3.15">But the way I see it, what
Apple silicon has done</text><text start="472.38" dur="5">to Apple&amp;#39;s lineup is it&amp;#39;s
brought down the minimum level</text><text start="477.63" dur="4.29">of machine that you can get
away with doing your workflow.</text><text start="481.92" dur="0.833">Does that make sense?</text><text start="482.753" dur="2.557">So like me, I edit a lot of videos</text><text start="485.31" dur="3.09">and so I need a powerful
machine for Final Cut Pro</text><text start="488.4" dur="1.77">and that sort of stuff, right?</text><text start="490.17" dur="3.81">So for the longest time I could
only use an Apple Desktop,</text><text start="493.98" dur="4.05">the highest end iMac Pro, the
Mac Pro, and I still will,</text><text start="498.03" dur="4.89">but I am now able to use Mac
Studio and I can actually edit.</text><text start="502.92" dur="2.94">I&amp;#39;ve had an M1 Max MacBook Pro for a while</text><text start="505.86" dur="3.45">and I&amp;#39;ve been editing
on the go with a laptop,</text><text start="509.31" dur="3.3">which is a huge like enabler for me.</text><text start="512.61" dur="1.98">And the same sort of thing
applies if you&amp;#39;re doing like</text><text start="514.59" dur="2.67">gaming stuff or if you have
a whole bunch of coding</text><text start="517.26" dur="2.55">and heavy, maybe even just encoding photos</text><text start="519.81" dur="2.4">or whatever you&amp;#39;re doing at that level,</text><text start="522.21" dur="2.88">you&amp;#39;d typically rely on a MacBook Pro.</text><text start="525.09" dur="2.55">But with these new chips
and with Apple silicon,</text><text start="527.64" dur="5">you can do that on a high-end
MacBook Air, which is again,</text><text start="532.65" dur="1.17">a pretty sweet enabler.</text><text start="533.82" dur="2.19">So that&amp;#39;s what the new M3 MacBook Air is.</text><text start="536.01" dur="2.52">If you do that sort of stuff,
it&amp;#39;s an amazing computer.</text><text start="538.53" dur="1.38">It should be on your shortlist.</text><text start="539.91" dur="1.71">Great all around, easy to recommend.</text><text start="541.62" dur="3.33">But again, if you&amp;#39;re doing
the lightweight, normal stuff</text><text start="544.95" dur="3">and you need a MacBook
Air, don&amp;#39;t get this one.</text><text start="547.95" dur="1.59">Get the cheaper one.</text><text start="549.54" dur="1.021">Okay, that&amp;#39;s it.</text><text start="550.561" dur="1.352">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="551.913" dur="2.55">Catch you guys the next one, peace.</text><text start="555.945" dur="2.841">♪ It&amp;#39;s the money, it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
the money, it&amp;#39;s the money♪</text></transcript>
