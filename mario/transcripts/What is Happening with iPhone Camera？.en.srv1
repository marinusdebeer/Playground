<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="3">(Intro SFX)</text><text start="3" dur="2.97">- Okay, what exactly is happening
with the iPhone&amp;#39;s camera?</text><text start="5.97" dur="3.09">Like we&amp;#39;ve done years of
blind smartphone camera tests</text><text start="9.06" dur="1.95">in bracket format and the iPhone,</text><text start="11.01" dur="1.71">supposedly one of the premium cameras</text><text start="12.72" dur="1.53">in the entire smartphone industry,</text><text start="14.25" dur="2.28">consistently loses in the first round.</text><text start="16.53" dur="3.15">Then we do a scientific
version with 20 million+ votes</text><text start="19.68" dur="1.987">and it finishes in the middle of the pack.</text><text start="21.667" dur="3.953">&amp;quot;And yet, Marques, you named
it the fourth-time running</text><text start="25.62" dur="3">best overall smartphone
camera system in 2022</text><text start="28.62" dur="1.47">and gave it a trophy.</text><text start="30.09" dur="1.05">What&amp;#39;s up with that?&amp;quot;</text><text start="31.14" dur="1.41">A concerning amount of people have started</text><text start="32.55" dur="2.04">to notice that the iPhones camera</text><text start="34.59" dur="3.33">feels like it&amp;#39;s taken
a few steps back lately</text><text start="37.92" dur="1.68">and I agree with them.</text><text start="39.6" dur="2.902">I think we should take
a closer look at this.</text><text start="42.502" dur="0.833">(relaxed music)</text><text start="43.335" dur="3.375">So first of all, cameras
have come a really long way</text><text start="46.71" dur="2.04">to the point where smartphone cameras</text><text start="48.75" dur="2.13">aren&amp;#39;t just cameras anymore.</text><text start="50.88" dur="3.24">See, back in the day, a
camera was basically a sensor</text><text start="54.12" dur="1.98">that would travel around
covered all the time</text><text start="56.1" dur="1.32">and when you wanted to take a photo,</text><text start="57.42" dur="1.53">you would expose that sensitive bit</text><text start="58.95" dur="1.17">to the environment around it</text><text start="60.12" dur="2.07">and it would collect
the light and close it.</text><text start="62.19" dur="1.71">Then the photo would be a representation</text><text start="63.9" dur="2.97">of how much light hit
each part of the sensor.</text><text start="66.87" dur="2.19">The better the sensor, the
better an image you could get,</text><text start="69.06" dur="2.49">the more light information, super simple.</text><text start="71.55" dur="0.99">These days though,</text><text start="72.54" dur="2.22">it&amp;#39;s turned into a whole
computational event.</text><text start="74.76" dur="2.16">Your smartphone sensor is
sampling the environment,</text><text start="76.92" dur="2.28">not once, but often several times</text><text start="79.2" dur="2.31">in rapid succession at different speeds.</text><text start="81.51" dur="1.62">It&amp;#39;s taking that light information,</text><text start="83.13" dur="1.74">merging exposures together.</text><text start="84.87" dur="5">It&amp;#39;s doing tone mapping, noise
reduction, HDR processing</text><text start="90.36" dur="1.83">and putting it all together</text><text start="92.19" dur="3.06">into what it thinks will
be the best looking image.</text><text start="95.25" dur="0.833">This, of course,</text><text start="96.083" dur="2.797">is a very different
definition of a picture.</text><text start="98.88" dur="2.94">So now it&amp;#39;s not just about
having the best sensor</text><text start="101.82" dur="2.25">that gathers the most light information,</text><text start="104.07" dur="2.34">it&amp;#39;s at the point where software</text><text start="106.41" dur="1.29">makes a much bigger difference</text><text start="107.7" dur="2.22">to the way the image looks
at the end of the day</text><text start="109.92" dur="1.05">than anything else.</text><text start="110.97" dur="0.833">Like next time you watch</text><text start="111.803" dur="2.437">a smartphone reveal event, for example,</text><text start="114.24" dur="2.28">keep an eye on all the new
additions that get made</text><text start="116.52" dur="2.52">and just how many of
them are pure software.</text><text start="119.04" dur="2.37">So Google basically struck
gold when they first</text><text start="121.41" dur="2.55">started using the IMX363 sensor</text><text start="123.96" dur="2.49">way back in the day with
the Pixel 3&amp;#39;s camera</text><text start="126.45" dur="3.24">because they got their software
tuning with it just right</text><text start="129.69" dur="1.83">and it was an instant smash hit.</text><text start="131.52" dur="2.52">So they kept using that great camera combo</text><text start="134.04" dur="1.53">in every Pixel since then.</text><text start="135.57" dur="3.96">The 3, the 3a, the 4, the 4a,</text><text start="139.53" dur="2.91">the 5, the 5a, and even the Pixel 6a.</text><text start="142.44" dur="2.19">So year after year of new phones,</text><text start="144.63" dur="2.52">same sensor, same software tuning combo</text><text start="147.15" dur="1.5">because it just worked.</text><text start="148.65" dur="1.32">If it ain&amp;#39;t broke, don&amp;#39;t fix it.</text><text start="149.97" dur="2.22">So when you saw the Pixel 6a</text><text start="152.19" dur="3.69">win December&amp;#39;s scientific
blind smartphone camera test,</text><text start="155.88" dur="3.21">what you saw was a four-year-old sensor</text><text start="159.09" dur="3.3">and software tuning combo
that is still so good</text><text start="162.39" dur="2.13">that in a postage-stamp-sized comparison</text><text start="164.52" dur="1.65">of compressed side-by-side images</text><text start="166.17" dur="1.32">where you can&amp;#39;t really judge sharpness</text><text start="167.49" dur="1.41">or depth of field too much,</text><text start="168.9" dur="2.22">basically just appreciating the basics,</text><text start="171.12" dur="2.76">this combo absolutely nailed the basics</text><text start="173.88" dur="0.84">better than anyone else.</text><text start="174.72" dur="2.49">Now, when the Pixel 6
came along, stay with me,</text><text start="177.21" dur="3.36">Google finally updated their
design and their branding</text><text start="180.57" dur="3.21">and they finally changed to a new sensor</text><text start="183.78" dur="1.29">with this new camera system.</text><text start="185.07" dur="2.34">So they go from the
tried-and-true 12 megapixel</text><text start="187.41" dur="3.51">to this massive new 50 megapixel sensor</text><text start="190.92" dur="3.15">and it kind of threw a wrench into things.</text><text start="194.07" dur="4.08">- So it looks to me that the
Pixel is over sharpening.</text><text start="198.15" dur="2.37">I think the one on the
left looks too crunchy.</text><text start="200.52" dur="1.8">- The camera on the
Pixel 6 does have a habit</text><text start="202.32" dur="2.16">of making things just look HDR-y.</text><text start="204.48" dur="2.04">I dunno if there&amp;#39;s really
a technical term for that.</text><text start="206.52" dur="1.32">- [Dan] And if you look at all the photos,</text><text start="207.84" dur="2.31">it&amp;#39;s clear the Pixel is
still doing Pixel things.</text><text start="210.15" dur="3.18">- I think Google&amp;#39;s still running all</text><text start="213.33" dur="2.73">of their camera algorithms at 11,</text><text start="216.06" dur="1.74">like when they don&amp;#39;t need to anymore.</text><text start="217.8" dur="2.37">- Right now, new phones
with much bigger sensors</text><text start="220.17" dur="3.48">are still processing like
their smaller older ones.</text><text start="223.65" dur="1.38">- The basic principle is:</text><text start="225.03" dur="2.76">they were doing all this
processing with the old sensors</text><text start="227.79" dur="1.53">as if they were not getting a lot of light</text><text start="229.32" dur="2.19">and then suddenly they had
this massive new sensor</text><text start="231.51" dur="2.28">which is getting way
more light information</text><text start="233.79" dur="2.76">but they were still running
all of this processing.</text><text start="236.55" dur="2.16">They would still do high-sensitivity stuff</text><text start="238.71" dur="1.32">and then they&amp;#39;d do noise reduction</text><text start="240.03" dur="1.77">because if you have high sensitivity,</text><text start="241.8" dur="0.84">you need noise reduction.</text><text start="242.64" dur="1.59">But then since you&amp;#39;re
doing noise reduction,</text><text start="244.23" dur="1.5">you need to do sharpening on top of that</text><text start="245.73" dur="0.833">to make up for it</text><text start="246.563" dur="3.037">and just overall you&amp;#39;re
doing way too much.</text><text start="249.6" dur="3.03">And so the photos are
literally overprocessed.</text><text start="252.63" dur="1.35">So this fancy new phone would come out</text><text start="253.98" dur="1.44">with a new camera system,</text><text start="255.42" dur="1.47">but you could argue, legitimately,</text><text start="256.89" dur="3.66">that the older Pixel still
took better looking photos.</text><text start="260.55" dur="2.07">So Google had to work really
hard at the drawing board</text><text start="262.62" dur="2.82">and make some adjustments and
some updates to the software</text><text start="265.44" dur="1.62">to dial in this new sensor.</text><text start="267.06" dur="2.64">It took a while, but
now with the Pixel 7 out</text><text start="269.7" dur="3.51">a full year later with the
same huge 50 megapixel sensor,</text><text start="273.21" dur="1.29">they&amp;#39;re back on track.</text><text start="274.5" dur="1.32">And hey would you look at that,</text><text start="275.82" dur="3.33">Pixel 7 right behind the Pixel
6a in the blind camera test.</text><text start="279.15" dur="2.28">So when I see iPhone 14 Pro photos</text><text start="281.43" dur="1.32">looking a little inconsistent</text><text start="282.75" dur="3.06">and a little overprocessed right now,</text><text start="285.81" dur="1.29">I actually see a lot of the same stuff</text><text start="287.1" dur="2.22">that Google just went
through with the Pixel.</text><text start="289.32" dur="2.85">Because the iPhone story is
kind of along the same lines,</text><text start="292.17" dur="2.34">they used a small 12 megapixel sensor</text><text start="294.51" dur="1.92">for years and years and years.</text><text start="296.43" dur="1.95">Then the 13 Pro sensor got a little bigger</text><text start="298.38" dur="1.77">but this year, the iPhone 14 Pro</text><text start="300.15" dur="1.62">is the first time they&amp;#39;re bumping up</text><text start="301.77" dur="3.9">to this dramatically
larger 48 megapixel sensor.</text><text start="305.67" dur="1.02">And so guess what?</text><text start="306.69" dur="1.62">Some iPhone photos this year</text><text start="308.31" dur="2.7">are looking a little too processed</text><text start="311.01" dur="2.64">and it&amp;#39;s nothing extreme, but it&amp;#39;s real</text><text start="313.65" dur="1.14">and they will have to work on this.</text><text start="314.79" dur="1.44">I suspect that by the time we get</text><text start="316.23" dur="3.99">to iPhone 15 Pro, you know, a year later,</text><text start="320.22" dur="2.52">they&amp;#39;ll have some new software
stuff they&amp;#39;re working on.</text><text start="322.74" dur="3.57">And I bet there&amp;#39;s one new
word they use on stage.</text><text start="326.31" dur="2.04">You know, we finally have Deep Fusion</text><text start="328.35" dur="1.5">and pixel-binning and all this stuff,</text><text start="329.85" dur="2.25">I bet there&amp;#39;s one new word they use</text><text start="332.1" dur="2.76">to explain some software
improvement with the camera.</text><text start="334.86" dur="1.77">But anyway, I think this
will continue improving</text><text start="336.63" dur="1.32">with software updates over time</text><text start="337.95" dur="1.92">and they&amp;#39;ll continue to get it dialed</text><text start="339.87" dur="1.3">and I think it&amp;#39;ll be fine.</text><text start="342.36" dur="3.18">But that&amp;#39;s only half my theory.</text><text start="345.54" dur="2.22">This does not explain why</text><text start="347.76" dur="2.73">all the previous 12 megapixel iPhones</text><text start="350.49" dur="2.43">also all lost in the first round</text><text start="352.92" dur="1.62">in all those other bracket style tests.</text><text start="354.54" dur="1.05">And this is a separate issue</text><text start="355.59" dur="2.73">that I&amp;#39;m actually a
little more curious about</text><text start="358.32" dur="2.04">because as you might recall,</text><text start="360.36" dur="4.71">all of our testing photos
have been photos of me.</text><text start="365.07" dur="1.56">Now, this was on purpose, right?</text><text start="366.63" dur="1.47">Like we specifically designed the tests</text><text start="368.1" dur="1.92">to have as many potential factors</text><text start="370.02" dur="1.47">to judge a photo as possible.</text><text start="371.49" dur="1.74">Like if it was just a
picture of this figurine</text><text start="373.23" dur="1.53">in front of a white wall,</text><text start="374.76" dur="2.82">the winner would probably just
be whichever one&amp;#39;s brighter,</text><text start="377.58" dur="2.67">maybe whichever one has a
better gold color, basically.</text><text start="380.25" dur="1.29">But then if we take the figurine</text><text start="381.54" dur="1.92">with some falloff in the background</text><text start="383.46" dur="3.45">now we&amp;#39;re judging both
color and background blur.</text><text start="386.91" dur="1.41">Maybe you add a sky to the background,</text><text start="388.32" dur="3.09">now you&amp;#39;re also testing
dynamic range and HDR.</text><text start="391.41" dur="2.28">So yeah, with our latest
photo, it&amp;#39;s a lot.</text><text start="393.69" dur="1.35">It&amp;#39;s two different skin tones.</text><text start="395.04" dur="1.83">It&amp;#39;s two different colored shirts.</text><text start="396.87" dur="2.28">It&amp;#39;s some textures for sharpness,</text><text start="399.15" dur="2.07">the sky back there for a dynamic range,</text><text start="401.22" dur="1.5">short-range falloff on the left,</text><text start="402.72" dur="1.23">long-range falloff on the right.</text><text start="403.95" dur="1.56">I mean with all these factors,</text><text start="405.51" dur="1.65">whichever one people pick as a winner</text><text start="407.16" dur="3.21">ideally is closer to
the best overall photo.</text><text start="410.37" dur="1.68">I also wanted the
pictures to be of a human</text><text start="412.05" dur="0.87">just because I feel like</text><text start="412.92" dur="2.49">most of the important
pictures that people take,</text><text start="415.41" dur="2.76">most often, that they care
about are of other humans.</text><text start="418.17" dur="0.93">But as it turns out,</text><text start="419.1" dur="3.15">using my own face as a subject for these</text><text start="422.25" dur="2.67">revealed a lot about how
different smartphones</text><text start="424.92" dur="3.9">handle taking a picture of a human face.</text><text start="428.82" dur="1.68">Because as I&amp;#39;ve already mentioned,</text><text start="430.5" dur="4.32">these smartphone cameras
are so much software now</text><text start="434.82" dur="3.54">that the photo that you get
when you hit that shutter button</text><text start="438.36" dur="2.46">isn&amp;#39;t so much reality</text><text start="440.82" dur="4.41">as much as it is this
computer&amp;#39;s best interpretation</text><text start="445.23" dur="4.11">of what it thinks you
want reality to look like.</text><text start="449.34" dur="3.03">And each company goes to a different level</text><text start="452.37" dur="3.99">of making different choices
and different optimizations</text><text start="456.36" dur="2.22">to change their pictures
up to look different ways.</text><text start="458.58" dur="2.01">They used to actually be a
little more transparent about it.</text><text start="460.59" dur="1.89">There are phones that
would literally identify</text><text start="462.48" dur="1.71">when you&amp;#39;re taking a landscape photo</text><text start="464.19" dur="2.97">and they&amp;#39;d pump up any greens
they can find of the grass</text><text start="467.16" dur="2.28">or they&amp;#39;d identify any
picture with a sky in it</text><text start="469.44" dur="2.22">and pump up the blues
to make it look nicer.</text><text start="471.66" dur="2.76">I did a whole video on
smartphone cameras versus reality</text><text start="474.42" dur="1.08">that I&amp;#39;ll link below the Like button</text><text start="475.5" dur="0.9">if you wanna check it out.</text><text start="476.4" dur="4.32">But the point is, when you
snap that photo on your phone,</text><text start="480.72" dur="2.01">you&amp;#39;re not necessarily
getting back a capture</text><text start="482.73" dur="1.8">of what was really in front of you.</text><text start="484.53" dur="2.58">They&amp;#39;re really bending it in many ways.</text><text start="487.11" dur="4.71">The iPhone&amp;#39;s thing is
when you take a photo</text><text start="491.82" dur="5">it likes to identify faces
and evenly light them.</text><text start="498.72" dur="1.23">It tries every time.</text><text start="499.95" dur="1.95">And so this feels like a
pretty innocent thing, right?</text><text start="501.9" dur="1.477">Like if you ask people normally,</text><text start="503.377" dur="2.303">&amp;quot;What do you think should
look good in a photo?&amp;quot;</text><text start="505.68" dur="2.67">And you say, &amp;quot;Oh, I&amp;#39;ll evenly
light all the faces in it.&amp;quot;</text><text start="508.35" dur="1.59">That sounds fine, right?</text><text start="509.94" dur="1.62">And a lot of time it looks fine</text><text start="511.56" dur="2.13">but it&amp;#39;s a subtle thing like in a photo</text><text start="513.69" dur="2.82">where you can see the light is
coming from one side clearly,</text><text start="516.51" dur="1.95">where you can see from the Pixel&amp;#39;s camera,</text><text start="518.46" dur="2.88">there&amp;#39;s a shadow on the
right side of the face.</text><text start="521.34" dur="1.11">With the iPhone though,</text><text start="522.45" dur="1.35">it&amp;#39;s almost like someone walked up</text><text start="523.8" dur="1.95">and added a little bounce fill, (chuckles)</text><text start="525.75" dur="2.64">just a really nice little
subtle bounce fill.</text><text start="528.39" dur="1.74">But sometimes it looks a little off.</text><text start="530.13" dur="2.43">Like look, this is the
low-light photo test we did</text><text start="532.56" dur="1.62">from our blind camera test.</text><text start="534.18" dur="2.04">On the left is the Pixel 7 again,</text><text start="536.22" dur="1.62">which looks like all the other top dogs.</text><text start="537.84" dur="2.61">And on the right is the iPhone 14 Pro</text><text start="540.45" dur="1.29">that finished in the middle of the pack.</text><text start="541.74" dur="2.7">It might be hard at first
to see why it looks so weird</text><text start="544.44" dur="3.54">but look at how they
completely removed the shadow</text><text start="547.98" dur="1.8">from half of my face.</text><text start="549.78" dur="1.5">I am clearly being lit</text><text start="551.28" dur="2.13">from a source that&amp;#39;s to the side of me,</text><text start="553.41" dur="2.55">and that&amp;#39;s part of reality.</text><text start="555.96" dur="3.21">But in the iPhone&amp;#39;s
reality, you cannot tell,</text><text start="559.17" dur="1.98">at least from my face, where
the light is coming from.</text><text start="561.15" dur="2.19">Every once in a while you
get weird stuff like this.</text><text start="563.34" dur="1.29">And it all comes back to the fact</text><text start="564.63" dur="3.303">that it&amp;#39;s software making choices.</text><text start="568.83" dur="2.82">And the other half of that is skin tones.</text><text start="571.65" dur="1.44">So you&amp;#39;ve heard me say
for a few years in a row</text><text start="573.09" dur="3.45">that I mostly prefer photos
coming from the Pixel&amp;#39;s camera,</text><text start="576.54" dur="1.26">and we&amp;#39;ve done lots of tests</text><text start="577.8" dur="1.65">where I have me as a sample photo</text><text start="579.45" dur="1.32">and you can tell it looks really good.</text><text start="580.77" dur="2.16">Turns out Google&amp;#39;s done this
thing over the past few years</text><text start="582.93" dur="2.43">with the Pixel camera called Real Tone.</text><text start="585.36" dur="1.5">It doesn&amp;#39;t get that much attention,</text><text start="586.86" dur="3.27">but it turns out to be making
a pretty big difference here.</text><text start="590.13" dur="3.57">Historically, a real issue for
film cameras back in the day</text><text start="593.7" dur="3.15">was that they were calibrated
for lighter skin tones</text><text start="596.85" dur="1.68">and people with darker skin tones</text><text start="598.53" dur="3.03">would typically be
underexposed in those pictures.</text><text start="601.56" dur="3.45">So now fast forward today,
cameras are all software.</text><text start="605.01" dur="1.2">Smartphone cameras are software</text><text start="606.21" dur="1.41">so they can all make adjustments</text><text start="607.62" dur="3.66">to account for different variety
of skin tones, of course.</text><text start="611.28" dur="3.51">But they still all do it to
different varying degrees.</text><text start="614.79" dur="0.93">Like you might have noticed</text><text start="615.72" dur="1.98">a lot of phones sold in China</text><text start="617.7" dur="2.85">will just brighten up
faces across the board</text><text start="620.55" dur="1.86">because that&amp;#39;s what people prefer</text><text start="622.41" dur="2.34">in photos in that region very often.</text><text start="624.75" dur="1.47">Google goes the extra mile</text><text start="626.22" dur="2.37">to train their camera
software on data sets</text><text start="628.59" dur="1.92">that have a large variety of skin tones</text><text start="630.51" dur="2.67">to try to represent them
correctly across the board.</text><text start="633.18" dur="2.07">And that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s calling Real Tone.</text><text start="635.25" dur="2.64">And Apple&amp;#39;s cameras,
from what I&amp;#39;ve observed,</text><text start="637.89" dur="3.48">simply just like to evenly
light faces across the board</text><text start="641.37" dur="1.8">and doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily account</text><text start="643.17" dur="4.2">for different white balances
and exposures necessary</text><text start="647.37" dur="3.21">to accurately represent
different types of skin tones</text><text start="650.58" dur="1.2">when I think they totally could.</text><text start="651.78" dur="2.22">So basically, it turns
out this is a big part</text><text start="654" dur="3.18">of what we were observing in Pixel&amp;#39;s</text><text start="657.18" dur="0.833">and a lot of the phones</text><text start="658.013" dur="2.287">that do accurately represent my skin tone</text><text start="660.3" dur="3.9">finishing higher in this
blind voting thing that we did</text><text start="664.2" dur="1.86">because they happen to
do that really well.</text><text start="666.06" dur="1.47">And that&amp;#39;s a thing that
people really considered</text><text start="667.53" dur="1.08">when they voted on them.</text><text start="668.61" dur="0.93">I haven&amp;#39;t said this a lot,</text><text start="669.54" dur="1.86">but I think this is one
of the earliest reasons</text><text start="671.4" dur="2.82">that I actually really
liked RED cameras was,</text><text start="674.22" dur="1.59">you know, obviously 8K is great,</text><text start="675.81" dur="2.85">Color Science is great,
but the way it represents</text><text start="678.66" dur="4.32">and renders my skin tone
accurately over a lot of,</text><text start="682.98" dur="1.77">you know, the Sonys and the ARRIs</text><text start="684.75" dur="1.47">and Canons that I&amp;#39;ve tried,</text><text start="686.22" dur="1.53">that&amp;#39;s actually one of the things</text><text start="687.75" dur="1.35">that really drew me to these cameras.</text><text start="689.1" dur="3.15">So all this software stuff
is why photo comparisons</text><text start="692.25" dur="2.58">between modern smartphones is so hard.</text><text start="694.83" dur="1.68">Like there are a lot of channels
that do a really good job</text><text start="696.51" dur="2.91">with the side-by-side
photo test, you know,</text><text start="699.42" dur="2.4">but even as you&amp;#39;re trying to
like pick one over the other,</text><text start="701.82" dur="1.11">you&amp;#39;ve probably noticed this,</text><text start="702.93" dur="1.47">you might like the way one of them</text><text start="704.4" dur="2.31">renders landscape photos over the other</text><text start="706.71" dur="2.64">but the way a different one renders photos</text><text start="709.35" dur="1.86">with your own skin tone and then the way</text><text start="711.21" dur="2.67">a different one renders photos
of your pet, for example.</text><text start="713.88" dur="3.21">So I&amp;#39;m sure Apple will defend
everything they&amp;#39;re doing now</text><text start="717.09" dur="3.03">with their current cameras
as they typically do.</text><text start="720.12" dur="2.22">But I&amp;#39;m gonna keep an
eye on what I&amp;#39;m also sure</text><text start="722.34" dur="1.35">which is they&amp;#39;re for sure working</text><text start="723.69" dur="2.73">on tuning these new
cameras, dialing it in,</text><text start="726.42" dur="1.98">and eventually getting it better</text><text start="728.4" dur="2.7">with the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro.</text><text start="731.1" dur="2.1">So back to the original question</text><text start="733.2" dur="0.99">from the beginning of the video,</text><text start="734.19" dur="1.747">we can&amp;#39;t leave that unanswered, which is,</text><text start="735.937" dur="2.093">&amp;quot;All right, the Pixel 6a,</text><text start="738.03" dur="1.92">you like the Pixel photos, Marques,</text><text start="739.95" dur="2.97">it won the blind scientific camera test</text><text start="742.92" dur="1.17">but you still gave the trophy</text><text start="744.09" dur="3.3">for best overall camera
system to the iPhone,</text><text start="747.39" dur="2.28">the very 14 Pro that
we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text><text start="749.67" dur="1.71">this whole video, why?&amp;quot;</text><text start="751.38" dur="2.58">And if you listen carefully,
you already got it,</text><text start="753.96" dur="3.18">which is that scientific test that we did</text><text start="757.14" dur="2.16">tested one specific thing,</text><text start="759.3" dur="2.55">it tested the the small
postage-stamp-sized,</text><text start="761.85" dur="1.92">you know, exposure and
colors general thing</text><text start="763.77" dur="1.89">with a bunch of different factors,</text><text start="765.66" dur="2.55">but sharpness and detail</text><text start="768.21" dur="3">with all the compression
that we did wasn&amp;#39;t tested.</text><text start="771.21" dur="2.01">Also, speed of autofocus,</text><text start="773.22" dur="2.7">reliability of autofocus wasn&amp;#39;t tested.</text><text start="775.92" dur="3.18">The open-close time of the camera app,</text><text start="779.1" dur="3.96">how fast and reliable you can
get a shot, wasn&amp;#39;t tested.</text><text start="783.06" dur="2.13">And also video wasn&amp;#39;t tested.</text><text start="785.19" dur="2.58">So the microphone quality, video quality,</text><text start="787.77" dur="2.19">speed and reliability of autofocus there,</text><text start="789.96" dur="4.11">file formats, sharpness, HDR,
all that stuff, wasn&amp;#39;t tested.</text><text start="794.07" dur="2.79">Maybe someday we will test
all that, but until then,</text><text start="796.86" dur="3.9">the lesson learned is the pretty pictures</text><text start="800.76" dur="3.61">that come from the Pixel or
whatever phone&amp;#39;s in your pocket</text><text start="805.29" dur="5">are partly photons, but
primarily processing.</text><text start="810.489" dur="1.011">(relaxed music)</text><text start="811.5" dur="1.41">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="812.91" dur="1.35">Catch you guys the next one.</text><text start="814.26" dur="0.833">Peace.</text><text start="816.199" dur="2.854">(record crackling)</text></transcript>
