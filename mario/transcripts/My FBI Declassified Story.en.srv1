<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.173" dur="3.127">(upbeat music)</text><text start="3.3" dur="4.68">- So I&amp;#39;ve made a few references
over the past couple years</text><text start="7.98" dur="5">to that time that the
FBI visited the studio,</text><text start="13.32" dur="1.98">and I was asked not to talk about that</text><text start="15.3" dur="2.25">for what I feel like are
pretty obvious reasons.</text><text start="17.55" dur="1.83">So for years I haven&amp;#39;t,</text><text start="19.38" dur="5">but it turns out I am now
finally able to tell that story.</text><text start="25.32" dur="2.28">So here we are.</text><text start="27.6" dur="2.13">So for those of you who don&amp;#39;t
know, we have a studio here,</text><text start="29.73" dur="1.41">and it&amp;#39;s in a larger building</text><text start="31.14" dur="1.89">with more tenants in it obviously.</text><text start="33.03" dur="1.32">It&amp;#39;s like an office building.</text><text start="34.35" dur="1.35">It&amp;#39;s not exactly like an office building,</text><text start="35.7" dur="1.59">but you know, there&amp;#39;s a front desk,</text><text start="37.29" dur="1.26">and security and all that.</text><text start="38.55" dur="1.77">And I&amp;#39;ve been in this building long enough</text><text start="40.32" dur="1.68">that we have a pretty good
relationship with them.</text><text start="42" dur="2.76">So we have this one rule, basically.</text><text start="44.76" dur="3">So there&amp;#39;s the guy at
security at the front desk.</text><text start="47.76" dur="2.4">We&amp;#39;ll call him Bob, just for this.</text><text start="50.16" dur="2.04">But Bob and I have this one rule,</text><text start="52.2" dur="2.85">which is that if anyone ever
shows up at the front desk</text><text start="55.05" dur="3">and asks for me that
he doesn&amp;#39;t let them in.</text><text start="58.05" dur="2.37">I have to come out and meet them</text><text start="60.42" dur="1.86">to confirm that I was expecting them,</text><text start="62.28" dur="2.01">and then I bring them back to our studio.</text><text start="64.29" dur="1.5">So if someone just randomly shows up,</text><text start="65.79" dur="2.85">which you shouldn&amp;#39;t, but if they do,</text><text start="68.64" dur="1.83">and I don&amp;#39;t show up at
the front to meet them,</text><text start="70.47" dur="1.26">then I wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to meet them.</text><text start="71.73" dur="2.34">But if I have someone
coming and I expect them,</text><text start="74.07" dur="0.9">I meet &amp;#39;em outside.</text><text start="74.97" dur="2.16">That&amp;#39;s our one rule, and we stick to it.</text><text start="77.13" dur="2.1">So in June, 2020,</text><text start="79.23" dur="2.31">it was pretty early in this
new space that we have,</text><text start="81.54" dur="2.76">and it&amp;#39;s also right
around like peak COVID.</text><text start="84.3" dur="1.68">So I had sent everybody home,</text><text start="85.98" dur="3.33">and it was just me and
Andrew coming into the studio</text><text start="89.31" dur="2.67">to work on basically building furniture,</text><text start="91.98" dur="2.22">and making videos, and recording
the podcast every week.</text><text start="94.2" dur="2.79">So I got here pretty early on
one of those summer mornings,</text><text start="96.99" dur="1.56">and I&amp;#39;m starting to get
all my stuff settled,</text><text start="98.55" dur="2.388">and then there&amp;#39;s a knock on the door.</text><text start="100.938" dur="0.833">(door knocks)</text><text start="101.771" dur="3.679">So I open the door, and it&amp;#39;s
our front desk guy, Bob.</text><text start="105.45" dur="4.92">And Bob basically says, &amp;quot;Hey
Marques, there&amp;#39;s some people</text><text start="110.37" dur="3.18">with badges at the front desk to see you.</text><text start="113.55" dur="1.5">I, of course didn&amp;#39;t let them in,</text><text start="115.05" dur="2.967">but if you would like
to, they&amp;#39;re up there.&amp;quot;</text><text start="119.07" dur="2.37">And then he just walked away.</text><text start="121.44" dur="3.123">And my first thought is confusion.</text><text start="125.455" dur="0.833">I&amp;#39;m like, what?</text><text start="127.2" dur="3.57">What did I do on the way here</text><text start="130.77" dur="3.51">that someone with badges
would show up asking for me?</text><text start="134.28" dur="2.1">I&amp;#39;m a little concerned.</text><text start="136.38" dur="1.14">I&amp;#39;m not sure what to think.</text><text start="137.52" dur="1.59">So there was a solid
minute where I just like</text><text start="139.11" dur="2.97">stood there in the doorway,
like, okay, do I go up there,</text><text start="142.08" dur="2.35">or do I just stay here in the studio</text><text start="145.29" dur="2.763">without asking who the
people with badges are?</text><text start="149.04" dur="0.833">Eh.</text><text start="149.873" dur="1.297">And then I just went up to the front.</text><text start="151.17" dur="2.28">I went up, I went up to the front desk,</text><text start="153.45" dur="2.58">and sure enough, there&amp;#39;s three
people with badges there,</text><text start="156.03" dur="1.26">and they walk right up to me,</text><text start="157.29" dur="2.55">and they all like flash their badges.</text><text start="159.84" dur="1.05">FBI, just like the movies.</text><text start="160.89" dur="3.63">Like FBI agent this, IRS agent this.</text><text start="164.52" dur="4.05">And they&amp;#39;re like,
&amp;quot;Marques, good to see you.</text><text start="168.57" dur="3.57">We&amp;#39;ve got some questions for
you about the Escobar phone.&amp;quot;</text><text start="172.14" dur="1.38">So immediately I&amp;#39;m relieved,</text><text start="173.52" dur="5">but I&amp;#39;m like, oh, oh,
oh, the Escobar phone.</text><text start="180.215" dur="0.833">Oh.</text><text start="181.048" dur="1.262">Because see, a few months earlier</text><text start="182.31" dur="4.47">I had published a video
about the Escobar Fold.</text><text start="186.78" dur="1.47">If you guys haven&amp;#39;t seen that video,</text><text start="188.25" dur="2.43">basically the story goes,
there&amp;#39;s this company</text><text start="190.68" dur="4.86">parading around and selling
this $400 gold folding phone,</text><text start="195.54" dur="3.42">which they&amp;#39;re gonna use to
destroy Apple and Samsung.</text><text start="198.96" dur="2.67">And they had these insane
marketing campaigns and all this.</text><text start="201.63" dur="3.57">But really what they were doing,
as I uncovered in my video,</text><text start="205.2" dur="2.94">was covering Samsung Galaxy folds</text><text start="208.14" dur="2.22">cheaply with like gold stickers,</text><text start="210.36" dur="2.49">and then shipping them to YouTubers</text><text start="212.85" dur="2.61">and people who they believed
would talk about it positively.</text><text start="215.46" dur="2.67">And then not shipping
any of the other orders</text><text start="218.13" dur="2.16">from regular people or the audiences</text><text start="220.29" dur="1.86">that watched those videos.</text><text start="222.15" dur="2.07">Those people were getting
scammed out of their money.</text><text start="224.22" dur="1.92">And honestly, in hindsight,
I don&amp;#39;t know how they thought</text><text start="226.14" dur="1.23">they were gonna get away with this.</text><text start="227.37" dur="2.13">Like it felt pretty obvious to me.</text><text start="229.5" dur="2.43">But, you know, eventually
their whole plan backfired</text><text start="231.93" dur="2.97">when I made a video
about the entire thing.</text><text start="234.9" dur="1.32">So now fast forward a couple months,</text><text start="236.22" dur="2.55">and it actually makes sense that the FBI</text><text start="238.77" dur="3.57">and the IRS are interested.</text><text start="242.34" dur="1.2">I just didn&amp;#39;t, I didn&amp;#39;t realize</text><text start="243.54" dur="3.42">they were just gonna show
up one day, but here we are.</text><text start="246.96" dur="1.62">But, you know, shout out
to Bob at the front desk</text><text start="248.58" dur="1.59">for sticking to our rule.</text><text start="250.17" dur="1.92">Even though he probably
had a bunch of people</text><text start="252.09" dur="3.96">like Flash FBI badges at
him, he stuck to our rule,</text><text start="256.05" dur="1.8">and that was great.</text><text start="257.85" dur="1.68">So I appreciate that.</text><text start="259.53" dur="3.03">But yeah, so I came out, I
brought them back to our spot,</text><text start="262.56" dur="2.91">and they basically then
had a bunch of questions</text><text start="265.47" dur="2.34">about that video</text><text start="267.81" dur="3.54">and the process of dealing
with that company in any way.</text><text start="271.35" dur="2.85">Like any and all communications
that I had with them,</text><text start="274.2" dur="3.87">any email I&amp;#39;d ever sent or
received from them ever,</text><text start="278.07" dur="0.833">they wanted everything.</text><text start="278.903" dur="1.927">And actually it was
funny, another tidbit is,</text><text start="280.83" dur="2.25">Andrew at the time had
just started running</text><text start="283.08" dur="1.77">the business email account here.</text><text start="284.85" dur="1.65">And when they were asking like,</text><text start="286.5" dur="2.85">has anybody else on your
team possibly ever been</text><text start="289.35" dur="2.46">in email communication with this company?</text><text start="291.81" dur="2.22">And I was like, I think Andrew might&amp;#39;ve.</text><text start="294.03" dur="2.37">And Andrew just had arrived at the studio</text><text start="296.4" dur="2.64">and walked up to the
front door of our spot.</text><text start="299.04" dur="2.13">And so I like, I go, &amp;quot;Hey, hey, come in.&amp;quot;</text><text start="301.17" dur="2.37">And you know, first thing he sees is like</text><text start="303.54" dur="2.61">me in an empty studio with
a bunch of people in suits,</text><text start="306.15" dur="1.14">like waving him over.</text><text start="307.29" dur="2.79">So he has a pretty funny
alternate perspective</text><text start="310.08" dur="0.833">on this story.</text><text start="310.913" dur="4.807">So the FBI actually took
the half peeled Escobar Fold</text><text start="315.72" dur="4.23">and the scratched gold
iPhone from my videos</text><text start="319.95" dur="1.62">as evidence in the case.</text><text start="321.57" dur="1.62">They literally asked for
them and took them away.</text><text start="323.19" dur="2.34">They put &amp;#39;em in sealed plastic bags</text><text start="325.53" dur="1.77">that said evidence on them,</text><text start="327.3" dur="3.21">which is why I said at the
end of the smartphone awards</text><text start="330.51" dur="0.833">that year-</text><text start="331.343" dur="3.847">Also honorable mention
to the Escobar Fold 2,</text><text start="335.19" dur="2.04">which I also don&amp;#39;t have on this desk</text><text start="337.23" dur="2.76">because it is in the
possession of the FBI.</text><text start="339.99" dur="1.53">Someday I&amp;#39;ll be able to tell that story.</text><text start="341.52" dur="1.41">So as they&amp;#39;re leaving, you know,</text><text start="342.93" dur="0.96">they&amp;#39;ve asked me all the questions.</text><text start="343.89" dur="2.85">As the FBI and IRS people are leaving,</text><text start="346.74" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re like, &amp;quot;Hey, don&amp;#39;t talk about this</text><text start="350.31" dur="2.1">at all publicly, please.&amp;quot;</text><text start="352.41" dur="1.29">And I&amp;#39;m like, &amp;quot;Of course, yeah.</text><text start="353.7" dur="1.56">No, obviously you&amp;#39;re the FBI,</text><text start="355.26" dur="1.62">of course I&amp;#39;m not gonna talk about it.</text><text start="356.88" dur="4.98">I don&amp;#39;t want to interfere with
the investigation in any way.</text><text start="361.86" dur="3.78">But also like, when could I talk about it?</text><text start="365.64" dur="5">Like, how long do you think
before I am allowed to?&amp;quot;</text><text start="370.71" dur="1.62">And they said, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll let you know.&amp;quot;</text><text start="372.33" dur="2.88">So I&amp;#39;ve been biting my tongue for years,</text><text start="375.21" dur="1.98">not talking about it,
hinting at it a little bit,</text><text start="377.19" dur="3.18">but not anything too serious.</text><text start="380.37" dur="3.42">But since then, a lot of the
dominoes have started to fall.</text><text start="383.79" dur="2.16">You know, at first when
the scam was happening,</text><text start="385.95" dur="1.65">PayPal stopped working with them.</text><text start="387.6" dur="3.81">So they&amp;#39;d switched to
this only non-refundable</text><text start="391.41" dur="1.92">direct transfer thing with Klarna.</text><text start="393.33" dur="1.83">And then they stopped
working with them too.</text><text start="395.16" dur="2.37">And then eventually the whole
operation starts falling down,</text><text start="397.53" dur="4.35">and the guy at the head of
it named Olaf Gustafsson,</text><text start="401.88" dur="3.36">this guy finally ends up getting arrested</text><text start="405.24" dur="3.9">and going to prison in Spain for fraud,</text><text start="409.14" dur="2.28">and money laundering, and
a bunch of other things,</text><text start="411.42" dur="2.67">basically for everything
that I talked about</text><text start="414.09" dur="0.9">in those videos.</text><text start="414.99" dur="2.31">So I&amp;#39;ve been holding onto
this not really knowing like,</text><text start="417.3" dur="3.48">okay, is it cool now that he&amp;#39;s
behind bars to talk about it?</text><text start="420.78" dur="4.17">So we actually reached back
out to those same FBI agents</text><text start="424.95" dur="2.16">because they left their cards,</text><text start="427.11" dur="1.147">and they&amp;#39;re like,</text><text start="428.257" dur="2.033">&amp;quot;Oh yeah, no, it&amp;#39;s cool
now to talk about it.</text><text start="430.29" dur="0.833">You&amp;#39;re totally fine.&amp;quot;</text><text start="431.123" dur="1.987">So there unfortunately is no footage</text><text start="433.11" dur="2.07">of any of this incident,</text><text start="435.18" dur="3.48">but there is these papers
which they provided as proof</text><text start="438.66" dur="2.1">that they received property to be used</text><text start="440.76" dur="1.74">as evidence in the case.</text><text start="442.5" dur="5">So one Pablo Escobar
Fold 2 mobile flip phone,</text><text start="447.57" dur="1.62">AKA Samsung,</text><text start="449.19" dur="4.47">and one Pablo Escobar
Gold 11 Pro mobile phone,</text><text start="453.66" dur="1.89">AKA iPhone 11 pro.</text><text start="455.55" dur="3.03">But hey, now you basically know the story.</text><text start="458.58" dur="2.01">Yeah, pretty serious business out here,</text><text start="460.59" dur="3.18">making videos about phones
sometimes, you know?</text><text start="463.77" dur="4.59">Apparently also, if this guy
Olaf ever does get charged</text><text start="468.36" dur="1.71">in the United States,</text><text start="470.07" dur="4.56">then it&amp;#39;s very likely my
videos would show up somewhere</text><text start="474.63" dur="2.16">in those court documents, which is crazy.</text><text start="476.79" dur="4.62">And also the phones that they
took may show up as evidence.</text><text start="481.41" dur="2.73">But yeah, I do wanna get back
into a little more of the</text><text start="484.14" dur="2.97">more investigative deep
dive type of videos.</text><text start="487.11" dur="3.96">Obviously the giant scams
don&amp;#39;t happen very often,</text><text start="491.07" dur="1.5">thankfully, in the tech world,</text><text start="492.57" dur="3.69">but still they are fascinating
stories when they do.</text><text start="496.26" dur="3.84">And by the way, that&amp;#39;s not the
only encounter that we&amp;#39;ve had</text><text start="500.1" dur="3.48">with the FBI in running
this YouTube channel,</text><text start="503.58" dur="2.22">but that&amp;#39;s another story for another day.</text><text start="505.8" dur="2.28">But hey, if you want more
fun stories like this one,</text><text start="508.08" dur="1.08">let me know with the comments.</text><text start="509.16" dur="2.46">But also the latest episode,</text><text start="511.62" dur="2.01">the bonus episode of the Waveform podcast</text><text start="513.63" dur="3.45">is just stories like this one
(upbeat music)</text><text start="517.08" dur="2.46">from the past couple years at the studio,</text><text start="519.54" dur="1.17">whole story time episode.</text><text start="520.71" dur="1.337">It&amp;#39;s fun.</text><text start="522.047" dur="1.003">So go over there and
subscribe and watch that.</text><text start="523.05" dur="1.83">But yeah, that&amp;#39;s basically it.</text><text start="524.88" dur="1.71">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="526.59" dur="1.44">Catch you guys on the next one.</text><text start="528.03" dur="1.138">Peace.</text><text start="529.168" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text><text start="533.01" dur="3.99">It&amp;#39;s a story of how I became a villain.</text><text start="537" dur="2.76">For at least 24 hours, I was hated.</text><text start="539.76" dur="1.11">- A couple weeks, I would say.</text><text start="540.87" dur="1.325">- Yeah, oh really?</text><text start="542.195" dur="0.833">A couple weeks.</text><text start="543.028" dur="0.833">Well, oh, &amp;#39;cause the
