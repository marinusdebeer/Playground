the Smartphone Awards 2023.</text><text start="14.289" dur="1.311">A lot of smartphones come out every year.</text><text start="15.6" dur="1.02">And this year is no different.</text><text start="16.62" dur="2.55">We got all kinds of shapes and sizes,</text><text start="19.17" dur="1.83">and features, and budgets.</text><text start="21" dur="1.38">Just a ton of phones.</text><text start="22.38" dur="2.07">And so like clockwork,
at the end of the year,</text><text start="24.45" dur="2.07">you can count on me to pick some favorites</text><text start="26.52" dur="2.55">in each of the categories
that I break it down in.</text><text start="29.07" dur="1.44">So this is a summary of the best</text><text start="30.51" dur="3.84">and some of the worse phones of 2023.</text><text start="34.35" dur="1.05">And these are my picks.</text><text start="35.4" dur="1.83">I always know I&amp;#39;m gonna get some push back</text><text start="37.23" dur="1.08">on some of the categories.</text><text start="38.31" dur="2.91">I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll hear in the
comments, and I&amp;#39;m fine with that.</text><text start="41.22" dur="1.65">But these are my picks,
so I&amp;#39;m sticking with them.</text><text start="42.87" dur="1.02">So the way this works is,</text><text start="43.89" dur="2.79">I&amp;#39;m gonna break this down
into the usual categories.</text><text start="46.68" dur="3.27">Every single category is
going to have one winner.</text><text start="49.95" dur="2.13">And then of course,
there can be a runner-up,</text><text start="52.08" dur="2.88">and maybe some honorable mentions
if we&amp;#39;re feeling generous.</text><text start="54.96" dur="1.68">And every single category,</text><text start="56.64" dur="3.03">we&amp;#39;ve actually had custom trophies made</text><text start="59.67" dur="2.04">to give to the winners.</text><text start="61.71" dur="1.53">And lately the companies that win these</text><text start="63.24" dur="1.383">actually do request them,</text><text start="65.537" dur="1.873">and sometimes end up displaying
them in their headquarters,</text><text start="67.41" dur="2.01">whatever they&amp;#39;re into, which is super-cool</text><text start="69.42" dur="0.9">for the recognition.</text><text start="70.32" dur="0.9">So, we&amp;#39;re doing it again.</text><text start="71.22" dur="0.9">So without any further ado,</text><text start="72.12" dur="2.04">let&amp;#39;s get started with our first category.</text><text start="74.16" dur="3.15">Best Big Smartphone.</text><text start="77.31" dur="1.11">So this is a phone one,</text><text start="78.42" dur="3.33">because smartphones have
been growing over the years,</text><text start="81.75" dur="2.25">and they&amp;#39;ve started to
get bigger and bigger.</text><text start="84" dur="1.62">But at the point we&amp;#39;re at now,</text><text start="85.62" dur="2.94">it does kind of feel like
they&amp;#39;ve stopped growing.</text><text start="88.56" dur="1.44">Am I the only one who feels this way?</text><text start="90" dur="1.95">I feel like everyone sort of agreed that</text><text start="91.95" dur="2.4">we&amp;#39;re not gonna go past
seven inch screen size.</text><text start="94.35" dur="2.04">Everything over that is ridiculous.</text><text start="96.39" dur="3.3">And so all these big
companies have their giant,</text><text start="99.69" dur="1.98">best smartphones pushing right up against</text><text start="101.67" dur="1.29">the seven inch screen size.</text><text start="102.96" dur="3.57">And trying to fit as much
as possible in that phone.</text><text start="106.53" dur="2.04">So, there&amp;#39;s a lot of competition in this</text><text start="108.57" dur="2.4">particular category.</text><text start="110.97" dur="2.76">And my winner for the Best Big Phone,</text><text start="113.73" dur="3.05">the best use of that space in 2023...</text><text start="117.78" dur="3.72">That&amp;#39;s going to the
Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.</text><text start="121.5" dur="1.23">Once again, the phone that comes out</text><text start="122.73" dur="2.13">at the beginning of the
year, kind of a sleeper,</text><text start="124.86" dur="1.92">but it holds steady the entire year.</text><text start="126.78" dur="2.16">The design is obviously
pretty understated,</text><text start="128.94" dur="2.16">which I think is why it goes
under the radar these days.</text><text start="131.1" dur="2.22">But it has all the hardware
you could possibly want.</text><text start="133.32" dur="2.52">It&amp;#39;s got that corner-to-corner 6.8 display</text><text start="135.84" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s super-bright,
quad HD, LTPO, 120 hertz.</text><text start="139.74" dur="2.25">It&amp;#39;s also got quad cameras on the back.</text><text start="141.99" dur="2.22">It&amp;#39;s got a 5,000 milliamp power battery.</text><text start="144.21" dur="3.99">It&amp;#39;s got the second latest
generation snapdragon ship.</text><text start="148.2" dur="1.83">Again, it came out in January.</text><text start="150.03" dur="2.34">And, it also has room for a stylus inside,</text><text start="152.37" dur="2.25">without really sacrificing anything.</text><text start="154.62" dur="1.38">Yeah, this thing is full of hardware.</text><text start="156" dur="2.46">And, it&amp;#39;s also gotten
software updates all year,</text><text start="158.46" dur="1.38">with a bunch more promised.</text><text start="159.84" dur="2.19">It&amp;#39;s hard to pick if there&amp;#39;s
one standout feature.</text><text start="162.03" dur="2.94">It might not be the huge 1440 P screen.</text><text start="164.97" dur="3.27">It might not be the 200
megapixel main camera.</text><text start="168.24" dur="1.86">But I actually think
it&amp;#39;s the massive zoom.</text><text start="170.1" dur="1.65">For anyone that cares
about shooting subjects</text><text start="171.75" dur="1.62">really far away, this camera system</text><text start="173.37" dur="1.8">basically still feels unmatched.</text><text start="175.17" dur="0.833">It feels kind of boring.</text><text start="176.003" dur="2.497">But it does feel like
that&amp;#39;s a pretty clear pick</text><text start="178.5" dur="3.66">for me for Best Big Phone of 2023.</text><text start="182.16" dur="1.35">But I do have a runner-up.</text><text start="183.51" dur="2.04">And this one&amp;#39;s not-so-obvious.</text><text start="185.55" dur="2.7">Because again, you kind of
get to blur the lines a bit</text><text start="188.25" dur="1.74">with these new phones
that have been coming out.</text><text start="189.99" dur="2.82">But, I&amp;#39;m giving my
runner-up for Best Big Phone</text><text start="192.81" dur="2.4">to the One Plus Open.</text><text start="195.21" dur="3.15">It definitely deserves a
mention because when it&amp;#39;s open,</text><text start="198.36" dur="2.13">becomes almost an eight
inch square display.</text><text start="200.49" dur="2.07">This phone, even this
new folding form factor</text><text start="202.56" dur="2.31">has all the hardware
you could possibly want.</text><text start="204.87" dur="1.65">And all the software features to match.</text><text start="206.52" dur="2.22">And I really enjoyed using
this phone this year,</text><text start="208.74" dur="2.7">despite how gigantic it is.</text><text start="211.44" dur="1.71">But I do also wanna
give honorable mentions</text><text start="213.15" dur="4.23">for Best Big Phone to Asus ROG Phone 7.</text><text start="217.38" dur="4.26">And Oppo Find S6 Pro.</text><text start="221.64" dur="2.43">Not these phones are lacking anything.</text><text start="224.07" dur="2.37">Again, the boring one won.</text><text start="226.44" dur="2.01">But maybe if this one
had wireless charging,</text><text start="228.45" dur="1.2">or if this one had more zoom,</text><text start="229.65" dur="1.08">it could of been in contention.</text><text start="230.73" dur="2.97">But these are two also
excellent giant phones</text><text start="233.7" dur="0.87">that came out this year.</text><text start="234.57" dur="4.17">So then, next up category,
Best Compact Smartphone.</text><text start="238.74" dur="1.62">Best Small Phone.</text><text start="240.36" dur="2.43">This one, I swear the pickings get slimmer</text><text start="242.79" dur="0.833">every single year.</text><text start="243.623" dur="2.827">Because not only are smartphones
getting bigger and bigger,</text><text start="246.45" dur="3.42">but also even the smallest
phones are getting further</text><text start="249.87" dur="1.11">and further from small.</text><text start="250.98" dur="3.39">Like the smallest phones
from the biggest companies</text><text start="254.37" dur="4.14">are still, do you wanna
call a pixel 7A small?</text><text start="258.51" dur="1.89">That&amp;#39;s a 6.1 inch screen.</text><text start="260.4" dur="2.7">Or maybe Galaxy S23, the baseline one,</text><text start="263.1" dur="2.25">that&amp;#39;s also a 6.1 inch screen.</text><text start="265.35" dur="2.13">It&amp;#39;s tough to find a truly small phone</text><text start="267.48" dur="2.34">that brings all the
flagship features down.</text><text start="269.82" dur="2.76">But there&amp;#39;s one that really did it.</text><text start="272.58" dur="1.86">And so, it definitely deserves this award.</text><text start="274.44" dur="3.15">The Best Small Phone, you
saw this coming already.</text><text start="277.59" dur="2.97">It&amp;#39;s the Asus Zenfone 10.</text><text start="280.56" dur="1.89">This is the flagship that
packs everything you need</text><text start="282.45" dur="2.37">and more, in an actually
one handable phone,</text><text start="284.82" dur="1.89">with a 5.9 inch display.</text><text start="286.71" dur="1.05">So, it deserves to be the winner.</text><text start="287.76" dur="1.71">And I&amp;#39;m so glad that this phone exists.</text><text start="289.47" dur="2.07">When I reviewed the Zenfone 9 last year,</text><text start="291.54" dur="2.34">I said it was pretty close to perfect.</text><text start="293.88" dur="1.28">It was just missing a couple of things.</text><text start="295.16" dur="1.63">It had a couple of small nitpicks.</text><text start="296.79" dur="1.68">When I reviewed the Zenfone 10 this year,</text><text start="298.47" dur="2.85">they fixed those nitpicks,
they added wireless charging.</text><text start="301.32" dur="2.19">They made the back of
the phone more durable,</text><text start="303.51" dur="1.53">some software tweaks.</text><text start="305.04" dur="1.86">It&amp;#39;s literally nearly perfect.</text><text start="306.9" dur="3.03">If you are thinking about
buying a small phone,</text><text start="309.93" dur="1.98">honestly it feels like this may be</text><text start="311.91" dur="2.79">one of the last good
ones you ever get to buy.</text><text start="314.7" dur="3.87">If you&amp;#39;re in the age of
wanting a mini phone,</text><text start="318.57" dur="2.19">speak now, or forever hold your cash.</text><text start="320.76" dur="1.38">&amp;#39;Cause they&amp;#39;re going away.</text><text start="322.14" dur="3.18">The only other phone that I
think could technically qualify</text><text start="325.32" dur="2.79">for this, would be some
of the folding phones.</text><text start="328.11" dur="2.31">Or flipping phones, I should say.</text><text start="330.42" dur="3.63">Chief among them being Samsung&amp;#39;s Z Flip 5.</text><text start="334.05" dur="1.08">Now when you open up the phone,</text><text start="335.13" dur="1.62">you&amp;#39;re still getting a pretty big screen.</text><text start="336.75" dur="1.41">It&amp;#39;s as 6.7 inch screen,</text><text start="338.16" dur="2.4">when you actually use a Z Flip 5.</text><text start="340.56" dur="2.58">But, as many of you have pointed out,</text><text start="343.14" dur="3.96">you can fold it down and
stow it in a much smaller</text><text start="347.1" dur="1.47">form factor than the others.</text><text start="348.57" dur="1.83">So even though it&amp;#39;s not
the most one handable thing</text><text start="350.4" dur="1.47">in the world,</text><text start="351.87" dur="1.413">it&amp;#39;s smaller.</text><text start="354.362" dur="2.248">So, shout out to the Z
Flip 5, Honorable Mention.</text><text start="356.61" dur="5">So next category the Best
Camera in a smartphone in 2023.</text><text start="361.92" dur="1.29">And this one I have a soft spot for,</text><text start="363.21" dur="1.47">just &amp;#39;cause I like cameras,</text><text start="364.68" dur="2.25">and you guys already knew that.</text><text start="366.93" dur="1.95">But there has been a lot
of really interesting stuff</text><text start="368.88" dur="1.95">pushing the boundaries
for smartphone cameras.</text><text start="370.83" dur="1.8">In the past year, especially.</text><text start="372.63" dur="3.51">A lot of it optically
with really cool hardware.</text><text start="376.14" dur="2.46">A lot of it with software,</text><text start="378.6" dur="3.57">with processing, with
AI, with all the stuff...</text><text start="382.17" dur="2.19">I mean, I might end up
making an entire video</text><text start="384.36" dur="1.14">on just how crazy it&amp;#39;s gotten,</text><text start="385.5" dur="2.9">because there&amp;#39;s been some
really interesting stuff lately.</text><text start="390.085" dur="3.485">But, my pick for best camera for 2023,</text><text start="393.57" dur="1.83">ruffles feathers every
time for some reason,</text><text start="395.4" dur="1.8">but I really believe in this one.</text><text start="397.2" dur="3.06">You already know, it&amp;#39;s iPhone 15 Pro.</text><text start="400.26" dur="1.05">This is my camera king.</text><text start="401.31" dur="1.89">And I have absolutely no regrets about it.</text><text start="403.2" dur="2.07">Now, it&amp;#39;s a simple fact that
many people love to point out</text><text start="405.27" dur="1.71">is yes, there are some smartphones,</text><text start="406.98" dur="3">even ones on this table that
can produce better photos</text><text start="409.98" dur="2.07">than the iPhone in certain situations.</text><text start="412.05" dur="1.11">Especially zoom.</text><text start="413.16" dur="2.46">But when it comes to just
the totality of performance</text><text start="415.62" dur="3.3">across the biggest variety of situations,</text><text start="418.92" dur="4.35">and ease of use for photos and videos,</text><text start="423.27" dur="1.23">the iPhone is still king.</text><text start="424.5" dur="1.11">Especially with a video.</text><text start="425.61" dur="2.1">I feel like it&amp;#39;s still
not particularly close.</text><text start="427.71" dur="3.48">See iPhone takes the best,
most consistent usable videos</text><text start="431.19" dur="2.43">in the biggest variety of
situations of any smartphone</text><text start="433.62" dur="0.87">by a long way.</text><text start="434.49" dur="2.82">They also added log recording
to the Pro iPhones this year.</text><text start="437.31" dur="2.49">They can also record
directly to an external SSD.</text><text start="439.8" dur="1.71">There was an Apple
keynote earlier this year</text><text start="441.51" dur="3.12">that turned out to be shot
completely on the iPhone,</text><text start="444.63" dur="1.77">and it looked incredible.</text><text start="446.4" dur="1.35">But some of you may already remember,</text><text start="447.75" dur="1.8">and I&amp;#39;ve pointed this out,</text><text start="449.55" dur="1.56">that&amp;#39;s not the first time
that&amp;#39;s happened already.</text><text start="451.11" dur="3.27">Samsung years ago did a
keynote that was live,</text><text start="454.38" dur="1.83">that was actually already shot.</text><text start="456.21" dur="2.043">And they announced it on the phone.</text><text start="459.3" dur="1.38">But you could tell,</text><text start="460.68" dur="2.85">like it wasn&amp;#39;t nearly as good.</text><text start="463.53" dur="1.203">You really could tell.</text><text start="465.599" dur="1.471">So this thing has been
producing incredible results.</text><text start="467.07" dur="1.44">Basically if you told me I could only have</text><text start="468.51" dur="3.06">one smartphone camera
for the next five years,</text><text start="471.57" dur="2.077">I think I would pretty
quickly just go &amp;quot;All right.</text><text start="473.647" dur="2.81">&amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s just send it
with the iPhone 15 Pro.&amp;quot;</text><text start="477.33" dur="2.19">I do also wanna give an
honorable mention, though.</text><text start="479.52" dur="3.54">To the Galaxy S23 Ultra.</text><text start="483.06" dur="2.46">This thing, especially
because of how well it does</text><text start="485.52" dur="3.36">with the zoom, has been
an awesome stills camera</text><text start="488.88" dur="0.96">for a long time.</text><text start="489.84" dur="0.87">Really good.</text><text start="490.71" dur="2.73">It also, I did a whole
video on it, reviewing it.</text><text start="493.44" dur="1.32">The 200 megapixel thing,</text><text start="494.76" dur="2.1">didn&amp;#39;t turn out to be
a big of a difference</text><text start="496.86" dur="2.966">versus the 100 megapixels
as you might of though.</text><text start="499.826" dur="1.804">But in general, really good.</text><text start="501.63" dur="1.62">And then, a shout out to the winners</text><text start="503.25" dur="3.06">of our scientific blind
smartphone camera test</text><text start="506.31" dur="2.28">that we ran online again this year.</text><text start="508.59" dur="4.53">We collected data from 20
smartphones that came out in 2023</text><text start="513.12" dur="2.55">and the overall most popular winner</text><text start="515.67" dur="3.9">for the standard photo was the Pixel 7A.</text><text start="519.57" dur="5">Then the winner for low light
photos was the iPhone 15 Pro.</text><text start="525.18" dur="3.96">And the winner for portrait
photos was the Pixel 8 Pro.</text><text start="529.14" dur="4.98">So next category, next
winner is Best Value.</text><text start="534.12" dur="1.17">Sort of shifted over the years.</text><text start="535.29" dur="1.59">It used to be Best Budget Phone.</text><text start="536.88" dur="3.6">But I sort of expanded it,
Best Value Option here.</text><text start="540.48" dur="2.91">And this is actually I
think the hardest one</text><text start="543.39" dur="1.35">for me to pick.</text><text start="544.74" dur="1.68">Believe it or not, which
I think is a good thing,</text><text start="546.42" dur="0.87">and a bad thing.</text><text start="547.29" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s a good thing,</text><text start="548.123" dur="1.627">because it means there&amp;#39;s some competition</text><text start="549.75" dur="2.22">in the high value options.</text><text start="551.97" dur="1.83">But it&amp;#39;s also not that good of a thing,</text><text start="553.8" dur="1.95">just because a lot of phones</text><text start="555.75" dur="1.65">have gotten price hikes this year.</text><text start="557.4" dur="2.22">There have been base prices going up.</text><text start="559.62" dur="1.65">Things that used to win budget awards</text><text start="561.27" dur="1.56">are more expensive now.</text><text start="562.83" dur="2.43">So I gotta make that
decision on what qualifies</text><text start="565.26" dur="1.02">as best value.</text><text start="566.28" dur="1.44">Like we all think a $1,000 phone</text><text start="567.72" dur="1.83">should not win Best Value, right?</text><text start="569.55" dur="1.35">Even if it&amp;#39;s a great phone.</text><text start="572.468" dur="0.833">But, how high is too high?</text><text start="573.301" dur="1.079">But after much deliberation,</text><text start="574.38" dur="3.45">I eventually landed on what
feels like a sweet spot.</text><text start="577.83" dur="3.96">A phone with basically
no stand out features,</text><text start="581.79" dur="2.61">but also basically nothing wrong with it.</text><text start="584.4" dur="3">The phone can be found
consistently for well under $400.</text><text start="587.4" dur="3.18">It&amp;#39;s the Samsung Galaxy A54.</text><text start="590.58" dur="2.61">It&amp;#39;s everything you need,
and nothing you don&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="593.19" dur="2.46">Like you could go more
premium and get more features,</text><text start="595.65" dur="1.62">and feel like you&amp;#39;re
enjoying the phone more.</text><text start="597.27" dur="2.46">But you could also go a little cheaper,</text><text start="599.73" dur="2.46">and start to notice a little
bit more corner-cutting.</text><text start="602.19" dur="2.28">But this does a really good
job of striking the balance</text><text start="604.47" dur="0.833">right in the middle.</text><text start="605.303" dur="1.447">You know how when someone asks
you like how your day&amp;#39;s been</text><text start="606.75" dur="2.497">and you just kind go, &amp;quot;Oh, it was fine.&amp;quot;</text><text start="609.247" dur="1.436">&amp;quot;Nothing really happened,</text><text start="611.653" dur="2.267">&amp;quot;it was all right, nothing notable.&amp;quot;</text><text start="613.92" dur="2.01">That&amp;#39;s this phone. Cameras are fine.</text><text start="615.93" dur="1.23">Battery, it&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="617.16" dur="1.53">The screen, it&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="618.69" dur="1.44">The design is fine.</text><text start="620.13" dur="1.053">Everything is fine.</text><text start="622.492" dur="2.051">So, for $400 bucks, you&amp;#39;ll be just fine.</text><text start="625.881" dur="0.833">I also wanna give an
honorable mention, though.</text><text start="626.714" dur="1.906">Because there is a phone
that dipped way down below</text><text start="628.62" dur="2.49">what I thought a really
good phone could be.</text><text start="631.11" dur="2.49">And that is the Moto G Play.</text><text start="633.6" dur="4.23">I reviewed this phone
as it came out at $169.</text><text start="637.83" dur="1.65">And to be honest, I was
very impressed with it.</text><text start="639.48" dur="1.71">And kind of evaluating the whole idea</text><text start="641.19" dur="3.03">of how a phone could be
decent at this price.</text><text start="644.22" dur="1.59">90 hertz and everything.</text><text start="645.81" dur="4.62">But also give a shout out to the Pixel 7A.</text><text start="650.43" dur="1.92">As you probably remember,
the price went up this year,</text><text start="652.35" dur="2.28">all the way up to 500 bucks.</text><text start="654.63" dur="1.47">But it did gain some stuff.</text><text start="656.1" dur="1.47">It has a 90 hertz display now.</text><text start="657.57" dur="2.13">It has better specs, and it still does</text><text start="659.7" dur="2.4">all the stuff that you
expect from a Pixel.</text><text start="662.1" dur="3.15">So, it deserves a shout
out for being a good phone</text><text start="665.25" dur="0.833">at that price.</text><text start="666.083" dur="1.147">So then, next up.</text><text start="667.23" dur="1.89">Best Battery.</text><text start="669.12" dur="2.79">Best Battery overall in a smartphone.</text><text start="671.91" dur="2.16">This doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily go to the one</text><text start="674.07" dur="2.52">that just has the
highest battery capacity.</text><text start="676.59" dur="4.08">I&amp;#39;m more giving Best Overall
Battery Experience award.</text><text start="680.67" dur="2.34">Ideally, you also have some
decently fast-charging,</text><text start="683.01" dur="0.93">or wireless charging.</text><text start="683.94" dur="1.83">Or, it&amp;#39;s just convenient
that it lasts for so long.</text><text start="685.77" dur="2.4">It might not actually be the biggest sell.</text><text start="688.17" dur="1.95">I don&amp;#39;t know that anyone&amp;#39;s
actually buying a phone</text><text start="690.12" dur="2.88">just because it has the
absolute best battery life.</text><text start="693" dur="1.563">But if you do live that life,</text><text start="695.777" dur="2.113">that no worries away from a charger life,</text><text start="697.89" dur="2.4">you&amp;#39;ll probably care about
the winners of this category.</text><text start="700.29" dur="2.91">So my winner, who&amp;#39;s getting a trophy</text><text start="703.2" dur="5">for best battery this year is
iPhone 15 Plus, specifically.</text><text start="709.35" dur="3.33">This thing just goes and goes, and goes.</text><text start="712.68" dur="2.55">The bigger battery, in general,
has a lot to do with it.</text><text start="715.23" dur="3.033">The 60 hertz display, also
has a lot to do with it.</text><text start="719.338" dur="1.232">But, if you want a risk-free no-brainer</text><text start="720.57" dur="1.86">great battery life, that&amp;#39;s definitely</text><text start="722.43" dur="1.23">gonna get it done for you.</text><text start="723.66" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;m also gonna give a shout
out to the ROG phone 7.</text><text start="727.95" dur="1.23">It doesn&amp;#39;t have wireless charging,</text><text start="729.18" dur="1.32">but it does have pretty fast charging.</text><text start="730.5" dur="2.04">And it has the biggest battery capacity</text><text start="732.54" dur="1.17">of any phone I&amp;#39;ve used this year.</text><text start="733.71" dur="3.12">6,000 milliamp powers.</text><text start="736.83" dur="1.71">And if you drop it down to 60 hertz,</text><text start="738.54" dur="2.97">it will also just go, and go, and go.</text><text start="741.51" dur="4.8">And also, another Asus phone,
which is the Zenfone 10.</text><text start="746.31" dur="2.25">This one kind of feels like wizard-like.</text><text start="748.56" dur="3">I don&amp;#39;t know how, because
it&amp;#39;s not the biggest battery.</text><text start="751.56" dur="3.791">It is pretty aggressive at
killing background apps,</text><text start="755.351" dur="2.481">and it&amp;#39;s probably missing
some bands in the U.S.</text><text start="757.832" dur="1.624">So, that might have
something to do with it.</text><text start="759.456" dur="3.354">But this phone, this small
5.9 inch display phone,</text><text start="762.81" dur="1.35">it&amp;#39;s killer battery life.</text><text start="764.16" dur="1.95">It can be a two day phone.</text><text start="766.11" dur="2.959">And you can drop it down
to 60 hertz, as well.</text><text start="769.069" dur="2.411">So, whatever Asus is doing
over there, keep it up.</text><text start="771.48" dur="1.71">Because battery life is great.</text><text start="773.19" dur="1.71">I recently talked about
this in my hot takes video</text><text start="774.9" dur="2.16">about how phones are getting
more and more powerful.</text><text start="777.06" dur="2.58">But generally the average
battery life hasn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="779.64" dur="1.65">really changed that much.</text><text start="781.29" dur="2.16">It&amp;#39;s just been all day is good.</text><text start="783.45" dur="2.16">So it&amp;#39;s good to see some
phone actually pushing</text><text start="785.61" dur="2.61">that envelope, and they
deserve to get rewarded for it.</text><text start="788.22" dur="2.373">So then, Best Design.</text><text start="791.539" dur="3.611">This one is so tough every time.</text><text start="795.15" dur="0.833">Best Design.</text><text start="795.983" dur="2.137">Because first of all,
design is subjective.</text><text start="798.12" dur="3.57">Like something I find pretty,
you might find ugly. Fine.</text><text start="801.69" dur="4.11">But also just in general, it
feels like every phone has</text><text start="805.8" dur="3.09">some flaw, some reason why,</text><text start="808.89" dur="1.53">and I can&amp;#39;t give it to that one.</text><text start="810.42" dur="1.26">Like think about it,
if you&amp;#39;re in my shoes,</text><text start="811.68" dur="1.26">you gotta give a design award, right?</text><text start="812.94" dur="2.37">First of all, a lot of
phones look pretty similar</text><text start="815.31" dur="2.04">to the way they did the
previous year, right?</text><text start="817.35" dur="0.833">So I can&amp;#39;t give it to one</text><text start="818.183" dur="2.017">that looks exactly the same as last year.</text><text start="820.2" dur="1.65">But also, I can&amp;#39;t give it to one that has</text><text start="821.85" dur="3.75">some fatal flow, if it&amp;#39;s missing
a camera it should of had,</text><text start="825.6" dur="2.22">or if it&amp;#39;s missing, it has a crazy bezel.</text><text start="827.82" dur="2.5">I can&amp;#39;t give it to the one
with the biggest notch,</text><text start="831.18" dur="1.41">or dynamic island, can I?</text><text start="832.59" dur="2.28">I can&amp;#39;t give it to the one
that&amp;#39;s made of plastic,</text><text start="834.87" dur="2.16">or the one that has a
curved display on the edges.</text><text start="837.03" dur="2.88">Like what is an actually flawless,</text><text start="839.91" dur="2.4">maybe it&amp;#39;s the most boring design.</text><text start="842.31" dur="1.47">But, you don&amp;#39;t wanna give the design award</text><text start="843.78" dur="2.55">to the most boring design.</text><text start="846.33" dur="0.833">This is a hard one.</text><text start="847.163" dur="1.567">And then it hit me.</text><text start="848.73" dur="4.14">There was a phone this year
that basically made headlines</text><text start="852.87" dur="1.89">just for its design.</text><text start="854.76" dur="3.09">In a good way, and I agreed with them.</text><text start="857.85" dur="2.49">And it absolutely deserves a
trophy for design this year.</text><text start="860.34" dur="3.57">It&amp;#39;s the Honor Magic V2.</text><text start="863.91" dur="0.84">This thing right here.</text><text start="864.75" dur="2.4">This phone legitimately
shifted the way I think</text><text start="867.15" dur="1.32">about phone hardware.</text><text start="868.47" dur="2.863">It was like a gear shift in
the world of foldable phones.</text><text start="871.333" dur="2.207">A think a lot of us didn&amp;#39;t even realize</text><text start="873.54" dur="2.37">that you could make a phone like this.</text><text start="875.91" dur="3.69">That has, first of all, it&amp;#39;s
under 10 millimeters thick,</text><text start="879.6" dur="0.93">when it&amp;#39;s closed.</text><text start="880.53" dur="3.21">Which is the same thickness
as plenty of regular phones.</text><text start="883.74" dur="2.1">It has a full-sized screen on the outside.</text><text start="885.84" dur="3.36">It has a corner-to-corner
foldable display on the inside.</text><text start="889.2" dur="3.72">It somehow also fits a 5,000
million power total battery.</text><text start="892.92" dur="3.45">Which I think is the biggest
I&amp;#39;ve seen in any foldable.</text><text start="896.37" dur="3.3">Toss in 60 plus watt charging,
a triple camera setup,</text><text start="899.67" dur="2.16">a terabyte of internal storage.</text><text start="901.83" dur="1.92">I think a lot of us didn&amp;#39;t
realize this was possible.</text><text start="903.75" dur="1.05">So even though the rest of the phone</text><text start="904.8" dur="1.17">might be a little questionable,</text><text start="905.97" dur="2.64">maybe some weird software
that I wouldn&amp;#39;t wanna use,</text><text start="908.61" dur="2.97">the one thing that nobody
could question is the design.</text><text start="911.58" dur="2.64">Everyone I&amp;#39;ve shown it to
universally is impressed</text><text start="914.22" dur="1.41">in some way by it.</text><text start="915.63" dur="4.77">But that actually brings us
to our first new category ad</text><text start="920.4" dur="2.07">in a long time in the Smartphone Awards,</text><text start="922.47" dur="2.94">and that is Best Foldable Phone.</text><text start="925.41" dur="2.73">So this is the first time
genuinely separating out,</text><text start="928.14" dur="2.76">and considering all of the folding phones</text><text start="930.9" dur="1.74">that came out during the year.</text><text start="932.64" dur="1.59">And the reason it&amp;#39;s getting
its own category this year</text><text start="934.23" dur="2.34">is because there&amp;#39;s
genuinely a large variety</text><text start="936.57" dur="4.41">of shapes and sizes and
versions of foldable phones,</text><text start="940.98" dur="2.01">and flippable phones
that we can choose from.</text><text start="942.99" dur="0.93">So I think in general,</text><text start="943.92" dur="1.65">I made a video talking about this already.</text><text start="945.57" dur="3.12">But folding phones are
quite on the doorstep yet.</text><text start="948.69" dur="0.9">Like, they&amp;#39;re close,</text><text start="949.59" dur="3.78">but they&amp;#39;re still mostly
thicker and more expensive</text><text start="953.37" dur="1.41">than normal phones.</text><text start="954.78" dur="1.53">But, I do wanna reward the ones</text><text start="956.31" dur="2.7">that are pushing the
boundaries in some way</text><text start="959.01" dur="1.71">towards that revolution.</text><text start="960.72" dur="4.503">So, winner for best
foldable phone in 2023,</text><text start="966.72" dur="2.76">yeah, that&amp;#39;s the OnePlus Open.</text><text start="969.48" dur="2.67">Man, this phone is good.</text><text start="972.15" dur="2.28">When I was thinking about
what I would personally</text><text start="974.43" dur="2.04">daily drive from the folding phones bunch,</text><text start="976.47" dur="1.89">this is the one that bubbled to the top.</text><text start="978.36" dur="2.55">This is folding phone I
would be most likely to use.</text><text start="980.91" dur="3.57">When it&amp;#39;s closed, it feels
the most like a normal phone.</text><text start="984.48" dur="2.82">Mostly because the aspect
ratio on the size of the screen</text><text start="987.3" dur="3">is normal phone-ish, flat sides.</text><text start="990.3" dur="1.38">But then you open it up,</text><text start="991.68" dur="2.85">and it&amp;#39;s a nearly eight
inch, almost perfectly square</text><text start="994.53" dur="2.55">folding screen with a very minimal crease.</text><text start="997.08" dur="3.03">Awesome specs, really good software,</text><text start="1000.11" dur="1.47">and a lot of fun features to back it up.</text><text start="1001.58" dur="1.11">I think my favorite part is just the way</text><text start="1002.69" dur="1.59">you can move around multiple windows</text><text start="1004.28" dur="1.56">and keep them full-size.</text><text start="1005.84" dur="2.25">And have them overlap sort
of the edge of the screen.</text><text start="1008.09" dur="3.09">It&amp;#39;s a fun and unique,
like actually new way</text><text start="1011.18" dur="1.77">of multi-tasking on a phone.</text><text start="1012.95" dur="0.93">And it actually works.</text><text start="1013.88" dur="2.19">This was the best phone
with a folding screen</text><text start="1016.07" dur="2.07">that was released during 2023.</text><text start="1018.14" dur="0.96">No doubt about that.</text><text start="1019.1" dur="2.58">It&amp;#39;s also basically
the exact same hardware</text><text start="1021.68" dur="3.213">as the Oppo Find End Three Fold.</text><text start="1025.872" dur="2.018">So, shout out to that one, as well.</text><text start="1027.89" dur="1.62">But I also wanna give an
honorable mention here.</text><text start="1029.51" dur="1.44">I&amp;#39;m gonna actually say it&amp;#39;s the runner-up</text><text start="1030.95" dur="1.803">in this category of best foldable.</text><text start="1034.577" dur="1.563">To the Pixel Fold.</text><text start="1036.14" dur="2.7">And that&amp;#39;s just because
this one specifically</text><text start="1038.84" dur="3.72">is my favorite foldable to use closed.</text><text start="1042.56" dur="1.65">Because the outside screen is so good.</text><text start="1044.21" dur="2.1">The outside screen is nice and compact.</text><text start="1046.31" dur="3.27">It&amp;#39;s the most reachable,
it&amp;#39;s the smallest, also.</text><text start="1049.58" dur="3.51">But it&amp;#39;s wide, it&amp;#39;s big, it&amp;#39;s
super useful to use closed.</text><text start="1053.09" dur="2.34">And for whatever reason,
I love that about it.</text><text start="1055.43" dur="2.19">I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s a
good thing or a bad thing,</text><text start="1057.62" dur="2.61">that I opened it way less.</text><text start="1060.23" dur="1.5">But it&amp;#39;s the best to use closed.</text><text start="1061.73" dur="2.622">And, I&amp;#39;m gonna give an
honorable mention as well</text><text start="1064.352" dur="2.478">to Samsung&amp;#39;s Z Flip 5.</text><text start="1066.83" dur="1.29">I mentioned it earlier in this video.</text><text start="1068.12" dur="1.71">But, a couple of things about this.</text><text start="1069.83" dur="1.98">One is, it feels like
it&amp;#39;s leading the pack</text><text start="1071.81" dur="1.02">for the flipping phones.</text><text start="1072.83" dur="1.17">I think it&amp;#39;s better than the Razer,</text><text start="1074" dur="2.67">I think it&amp;#39;s better than some
of the other flipping ones.</text><text start="1076.67" dur="4.56">But also as far as build quality,
and just quality control,</text><text start="1081.23" dur="3.03">Samsung in general, is
at the top of the heap.</text><text start="1084.26" dur="1.77">Basically every other folding phone</text><text start="1086.03" dur="2.85">has had some level of
quality control issues</text><text start="1088.88" dur="2.04">at some point and some rate.</text><text start="1090.92" dur="1.59">And Samsung ironically, the ones that had</text><text start="1092.51" dur="1.56">the biggest issues at the beginning,</text><text start="1094.07" dur="2.31">have ironed it out the most over time.</text><text start="1096.38" dur="2.22">So that&amp;#39;s their reward
for jumping in early.</text><text start="1098.6" dur="2.15">Also, I have to give
that honorable mention</text><text start="1101.709" dur="3.148">to the Honor Magic E2,
just purely for the design.</text><text start="1104.857" dur="1.393">I still can&amp;#39;t believe
they made this phone.</text><text start="1106.25" dur="0.833">Super-impressive.</text><text start="1107.083" dur="3.247">So, next award, Most Improved.</text><text start="1110.33" dur="1.653">The Most Improved Award.</text><text start="1113.12" dur="1.65">Hmm.</text><text start="1114.77" dur="1.83">It&amp;#39;s interesting because again,</text><text start="1116.6" dur="2.04">lots of phones play it safe.</text><text start="1118.64" dur="3.63">Lots of phones are just a
slight evolution from last year.</text><text start="1122.27" dur="1.59">They&amp;#39;re a slight spec bump.</text><text start="1123.86" dur="2.37">And I can&amp;#39;t get mad at that if
they&amp;#39;re already a good phone.</text><text start="1126.23" dur="1.92">Like Zenfone, for example.</text><text start="1128.15" dur="2.43">I&amp;#39;m happy they kept a
lot of things the same.</text><text start="1130.58" dur="1.89">But then, that makes
the Most Improved Award</text><text start="1132.47" dur="3.96">a little more of a quirky pick.</text><text start="1136.43" dur="2.28">Maybe not the most
obvious pick in the world.</text><text start="1138.71" dur="4.2">But I&amp;#39;m gonna go with the Nothing Phone 2.</text><text start="1142.91" dur="2.04">Most Improved Phone 2023.</text><text start="1144.95" dur="2.07">So this is part hardware story,</text><text start="1147.02" dur="1.47">and part a software story.</text><text start="1148.49" dur="1.62">So obviously, they didn&amp;#39;t
change the hardware</text><text start="1150.11" dur="2.16">a ton from the first Nothing Phone.</text><text start="1152.27" dur="1.35">Because they&amp;#39;re literally brand new,</text><text start="1153.62" dur="1.68">so they&amp;#39;re just getting
their identity set.</text><text start="1155.3" dur="2.79">So yeah, there&amp;#39;s a newer,
higher resolution LED pattern</text><text start="1158.09" dur="0.84">on the back.</text><text start="1158.93" dur="1.65">There is a slightly curved glass now</text><text start="1160.58" dur="1.23">to feel a little better in the hand.</text><text start="1161.81" dur="2.16">But generally, it still
looks like a nothing phone.</text><text start="1163.97" dur="2.46">But they also did a lot with the software,</text><text start="1166.43" dur="4.77">specifically moving to
Nothing OS 2.0 and then 2.5.</text><text start="1171.2" dur="2.07">Which now on Android 14.</text><text start="1173.27" dur="1.89">Which gets a lot of new
stuff with this phone.</text><text start="1175.16" dur="2.34">There&amp;#39;s a focus on
efficiency and smoothness,</text><text start="1177.5" dur="1.35">and then adding all these features.</text><text start="1178.85" dur="1.62">And there&amp;#39;s also been fantastic.</text><text start="1180.47" dur="2.37">So you combine that with the new specs,</text><text start="1182.84" dur="1.8">the slightly bumped design,</text><text start="1184.64" dur="2.31">and then a bunch of the new
features that unfortunately</text><text start="1186.95" dur="1.89">the Phone 1.0 isn&amp;#39;t getting,</text><text start="1188.84" dur="3.03">like the better glif controls,
and clone app feature,</text><text start="1191.87" dur="1.77">and monochrome theme and stuff.</text><text start="1193.64" dur="2.46">It just adds up to a
pretty big improvement.</text><text start="1196.1" dur="1.26">To the point where in this world</text><text start="1197.36" dur="2.7">with most people just being
able to buy last year&amp;#39;s phone</text><text start="1200.06" dur="0.96">and be totally fine.</text><text start="1201.02" dur="1.38">With this phone, I would actually say,</text><text start="1202.4" dur="1.53">don&amp;#39;t buy last year&amp;#39;s phone.</text><text start="1203.93" dur="2.58">You should just get the
Phone 2, over the Phone 1.</text><text start="1206.51" dur="2.04">Plus you can send blue bubbles to,</text><text start="1208.55" dur="2.52">oh, wait, sorry never
mind, you can&amp;#39;t do that.</text><text start="1211.07" dur="3.24">But still, Phone 2, much improved.</text><text start="1214.31" dur="2.01">It&amp;#39;s probably gonna steady out after this.</text><text start="1216.32" dur="1.71">And this was nice to put them on the map.</text><text start="1218.03" dur="1.47">But now, they&amp;#39;ll have to stabilize</text><text start="1219.5" dur="1.77">and become a real company.</text><text start="1221.27" dur="2.76">And you know what? Honorable Mention.</text><text start="1224.03" dur="2.43">Just because I don&amp;#39;t know
if anyone else can say</text><text start="1226.46" dur="2.67">they technically made this
big of a change in their phone</text><text start="1229.13" dur="4.35">as much as switching the
iPhone 15 to USB type C.</text><text start="1233.48" dur="2.13">So, Honorable Mention to the iPhone.</text><text start="1235.61" dur="1.62">All right, next up.</text><text start="1237.23" dur="1.62">Bust of the Year.</text><text start="1238.85" dur="3.3">The award you don&amp;#39;t
really wanna have to give,</text><text start="1242.15" dur="2.37">but one of these phones on this desk</text><text start="1244.52" dur="3.45">is gonna win Worse New Phone of 2023.</text><text start="1247.97" dur="2.25">Look, I do have to preface
this basically every time</text><text start="1250.22" dur="2.13">by saying, it is actually
genuinely hard now</text><text start="1252.35" dur="1.74">to get a bad phone.</text><text start="1254.09" dur="2.52">Like most phones, no matter
what price point you&amp;#39;re at</text><text start="1256.61" dur="2.25">are either gonna be
really good for the money,</text><text start="1258.86" dur="1.29">or okay for the money.</text><text start="1260.15" dur="2.253">It&amp;#39;s hard to get a bad phone.</text><text start="1263.42" dur="3.78">But there was one bad phone this year.</text><text start="1267.2" dur="1.95">And so, it&amp;#39;s gonna win a trophy for it.</text><text start="1269.15" dur="5">And that would be Solama Saga Cryto Phone.</text><text start="1275.69" dur="0.84">Bust of the year.</text><text start="1276.53" dur="2.58">There is actually no price
that I would recommend</text><text start="1279.11" dur="1.38">anyone buys this phone.</text><text start="1280.49" dur="2.64">Buying this phone is
like buying a timeshare.</text><text start="1283.13" dur="3.45">It might seem like a good
idea for two seconds.</text><text start="1286.58" dur="1.56">But the second you actually do it,</text><text start="1288.14" dur="2.07">you realize how horrible
of an idea it was.</text><text start="1290.21" dur="2.28">And, this is just a bad phone.</text><text start="1292.49" dur="2.01">The one redeeming quality is actually</text><text start="1294.5" dur="2.31">it does have this nice build quality.</text><text start="1296.81" dur="2.823">It&amp;#39;s got ceramic, and it&amp;#39;s
nice and weighty and heavy.</text><text start="1300.61" dur="1.39">But yeah, that was wasted on this phone.</text><text start="1302" dur="2.34">You could tell because
of the story behind it.</text><text start="1304.34" dur="1.2">That it wasn&amp;#39;t going to go well.</text><text start="1305.54" dur="1.5">I&amp;#39;ll leave a link below to the full video</text><text start="1307.04" dur="1.62">I did about it, if you have any itch</text><text start="1308.66" dur="1.9">to just hear about something horrible.</text><text start="1311.701" dur="2.569">But that&amp;#39;s a pretty clear
one for bust of the year.</text><text start="1314.27" dur="2.31">I&amp;#39;m also gonna give an honorable mention</text><text start="1316.58" dur="4.44">to all of the concept phones
that were announced this year</text><text start="1321.02" dur="1.5">and never came out.</text><text start="1322.52" dur="1.26">And never will.</text><text start="1323.78" dur="1.395">You know who you are.</text><text start="1325.175" dur="2.055">So that brings us to the
biggest trophy of the night,</text><text start="1327.23" dur="1.35">well, it&amp;#39;s the same size
as the other trophies,</text><text start="1328.58" dur="2.977">but it&amp;#39;s the most important,
it&amp;#39;s the best one.</text><text start="1331.557" dur="1.703">It&amp;#39;s the one you wanna win, the MVP.</text><text start="1333.26" dur="1.86">The Most Valuable Phone.</text><text start="1335.12" dur="2.46">Well, not actually valuable value-wise,</text><text start="1337.58" dur="3.09">but it&amp;#39;s really just my
favorite phone of the year.</text><text start="1340.67" dur="1.83">At the end of the day,
it&amp;#39;s come down to like,</text><text start="1342.5" dur="1.44">there are really good phones.</text><text start="1343.94" dur="1.62">They are the ones that
have the biggest impact</text><text start="1345.56" dur="1.14">on the industry.</text><text start="1346.7" dur="2.49">They&amp;#39;re the ones that are the
most fun, the most unique,</text><text start="1349.19" dur="1.05">the most innovative,</text><text start="1350.24" dur="1.8">the ones that have the best features.</text><text start="1352.04" dur="3.06">And this one sort of
just combines all of that</text><text start="1355.1" dur="3.99">into one trophy of
recognition for the MVP,</text><text start="1359.09" dur="3.09">the Phone of the Year for 2023.</text><text start="1362.18" dur="0.99">So, what&amp;#39;s it gonna be?</text><text start="1363.17" dur="2.13">I mean, there&amp;#39;s been some
really interesting stories.</text><text start="1365.3" dur="2.22">There&amp;#39;s been some disruptive phones.</text><text start="1367.52" dur="2.85">There&amp;#39;s some great phones
that I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed using.</text><text start="1370.37" dur="4.5">My winner for MVP, for
Phone of the Year 2023,</text><text start="1374.87" dur="3.06">is going to the Pixel 8.</text><text start="1377.93" dur="2.76">Well-deserved, big shout
out to the Pixel 8.</text><text start="1380.69" dur="2.01">It has stepped it up over last year.</text><text start="1382.7" dur="1.98">So there&amp;#39;s a bunch of
things about this phone</text><text start="1386.167" dur="2.394">that are genuinely
different from last year.</text><text start="1388.561" dur="3.493">But the headlining one, the
one that matters the most</text><text start="1392.054" dur="0.833">is it&amp;#39;s a $100 more
expensive than the Pixel 7,</text><text start="1392.887" dur="1.723">so it&amp;#39;s really gotta
deliver and be a great phone</text><text start="1394.61" dur="1.41">to be worthy of that.</text><text start="1396.02" dur="0.833">And it does.</text><text start="1396.853" dur="1.327">This phone has a great camera.</text><text start="1398.18" dur="2.43">Not miles ahead of the
rest like previous years,</text><text start="1400.61" dur="2.58">but still and incredible
stills photo camera.</text><text start="1403.19" dur="2.25">It has a dramatically better display.</text><text start="1405.44" dur="2.13">It&amp;#39;s stepped up to a 120 hertz.</text><text start="1407.57" dur="3.03">It&amp;#39;s got this flagship class, 2000 knits.</text><text start="1410.6" dur="1.2">Super-bright.</text><text start="1411.8" dur="3.33">It also has the same tensored
G3 chip as the Pro Phone,</text><text start="1415.13" dur="1.41">which is several hundred dollars more,</text><text start="1416.54" dur="1.11">and also a flagship.</text><text start="1417.65" dur="2.07">And then, just a ridiculous
amount of software features.</text><text start="1419.72" dur="2.4">Again, matching the more
expensive Pro Phone,</text><text start="1422.12" dur="2.73">which makes it harder and
harder to justify the Pro Phone,</text><text start="1424.85" dur="2.4">which I use daily and love.</text><text start="1427.25" dur="2.49">But still, for the
hundreds of dollars less,</text><text start="1429.74" dur="2.68">this is the way you should probably go.</text><text start="1432.42" dur="4.76">And, it&amp;#39;s promising now seven
years of software updates.</text><text start="1437.18" dur="2.64">Seven years of software updates,</text><text start="1439.82" dur="1.59">which is pretty incredible for a phone.</text><text start="1441.41" dur="2.52">So just among all the things
that came out this year,</text><text start="1443.93" dur="2.7">as far as a well-rounded
package for impact,</text><text start="1446.63" dur="1.95">for price, for stepping it up,</text><text start="1448.58" dur="2.25">and being a really good phone, Pixel 8.</text><text start="1450.83" dur="0.96">Now, I do have a runner up.</text><text start="1451.79" dur="3">I really again, super-love
this phone this year.</text><text start="1454.79" dur="2.25">And it&amp;#39;s not gonna be a
popular phone, either.</text><text start="1457.04" dur="1.11">But I love it anyway.</text><text start="1458.15" dur="2.415">It&amp;#39;s the Asus Zenphone 10.</text><text start="1460.565" dur="0.833">Some of you already know,</text><text start="1461.398" dur="1.132">because of what it did last year,</text><text start="1462.53" dur="1.5">how good these phones are.</text><text start="1464.03" dur="3.69">And it does it again in this
weird physics-defying package</text><text start="1467.72" dur="2.16">of basically being nearly perfect.</text><text start="1469.88" dur="3.09">Small, compact, reachable,</text><text start="1472.97" dur="1.98">surprisingly-good cameras.</text><text start="1474.95" dur="1.44">Excellent performance,</text><text start="1476.39" dur="1.53">shockingly good battery life.</text><text start="1477.92" dur="2.13">Just, I don&amp;#39;t have a
lot of bad things to say</text><text start="1480.05" dur="1.11">about this phone.</text><text start="1481.16" dur="1.65">Zenphone 10, it&amp;#39;s really good.</text><text start="1482.81" dur="1.879">You should watch the full review.</text><text start="1484.689" dur="1.541">And, I&amp;#39;m also gonna give
an honorable mention</text><text start="1486.23" dur="2.64">to iPhone 15 Pro.</text><text start="1488.87" dur="3.21">Specifically for basically now feeling</text><text start="1492.08" dur="2.19">like we&amp;#39;ve reached peak iPhone.</text><text start="1494.27" dur="1.26">I know you could of said this about</text><text start="1495.53" dur="1.02">a lot of previous iPhones.</text><text start="1496.55" dur="2.07">But, now that it is USB type C,</text><text start="1498.62" dur="2.16">and now that the notch
has been gone for a bit,</text><text start="1500.78" dur="1.05">and is a dynamic island.</text><text start="1501.83" dur="3.18">This just feels like a finished phone.</text><text start="1505.01" dur="2.1">There&amp;#39;s not a whole lot of other things</text><text start="1507.11" dur="3.09">that I&amp;#39;m expecting to land
with a bang on the iPhone.</text><text start="1510.2" dur="2.88">Maybe a fingerprint
reader, or fast-charging.</text><text start="1513.08" dur="1.35">Maybe that&amp;#39;s about it.</text><text start="1514.43" dur="2.13">But, this is the best
iPhone ever, clearly.</text><text start="1516.56" dur="1.897">And I feel like it&amp;#39;s
finally hit that stride of</text><text start="1518.457" dur="1.733">&amp;quot;All right, you&amp;#39;ve done it.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1520.19" dur="0.96">Two other quick mentions.</text><text start="1521.15" dur="1.44">I do have to give a shout out,</text><text start="1522.59" dur="3.75">an honorable mention to
the ultra-boring S23 Ultra.</text><text start="1526.34" dur="1.92">Just because this is that phone that is,</text><text start="1528.26" dur="1.2">it doesn&amp;#39;t have any flaws,</text><text start="1529.46" dur="2.37">it&amp;#39;s just a rock-solid phone all around.</text><text start="1531.83" dur="1.35">And it consistently gets buried</text><text start="1533.18" dur="1.44">when you think about the December videos.</text><text start="1534.62" dur="2.64">The phone that came out 12
months ago, but I have to.</text><text start="1537.26" dur="1.4">This is a really good phone.</text><text start="1539.696" dur="2.814">And, I wanna give a shout
out to the One Plus Open</text><text start="1542.51" dur="2.31">for being the foldable phone that I think</text><text start="1544.82" dur="1.8">I could actually recommend to real people.</text><text start="1546.62" dur="2.37">Not that most people are
gonna spend 1800 bucks</text><text start="1548.99" dur="1.02">on a foldable phone, anyway.</text><text start="1550.01" dur="2.34">But if you&amp;#39;re going to for one of them,</text><text start="1552.35" dur="1.53">this is the phone that I would daily,</text><text start="1553.88" dur="3.364">if you had to tell me to
pick a folding phone today.</text><text start="1557.244" dur="1.549">So shout out to the One Plus Open.</text><text start="1560.637" dur="0.833">And, that&amp;#39;s it.</text><text start="1561.47" dur="1.98">That&amp;#39;s my Smartphone Awards for 2023.</text><text start="1563.45" dur="1.23">So let me know how all of you are feeling.</text><text start="1564.68" dur="1.56">I know there&amp;#39;s gonna
be comments down below,</text><text start="1566.24" dur="1.56">and I can&amp;#39;t wait to hang
out and see which ones</text><text start="1567.8" dur="2.01">you would of picked for your awards.</text><text start="1569.81" dur="1.89">Maybe other people will
make their own awards, too.</text><text start="1571.7" dur="2.34">But, I&amp;#39;m pretty happy with my list.</text><text start="1574.04" dur="2.883">So, until the next one,
catch you guys later.</text><text start="1577.862" dur="3.083">Peace.
