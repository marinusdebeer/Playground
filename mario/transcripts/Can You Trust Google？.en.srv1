<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="0.971">- All right, we just gotta,</text><text start="0.971" dur="1.279">we just gotta talk about
something real quick.</text><text start="2.25" dur="3.12">So, one of the biggest
announcements at Google&amp;#39;s fall event</text><text start="5.37" dur="1.32">that they just had was
that they&amp;#39;re planning</text><text start="6.69" dur="2.43">on supporting the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro</text><text start="9.12" dur="5">with seven years of OS security
and feature drop updates.</text><text start="15.66" dur="2.91">This is industry leading
and super awesome.</text><text start="18.57" dur="1.32">Here&amp;#39;s a list of some
of the other promises</text><text start="19.89" dur="1.29">that have been made in
the smartphone world</text><text start="21.18" dur="1.74">for how long down the road they plan</text><text start="22.92" dur="1.354">on supporting their devices.</text><text start="24.274" dur="2.426">In the world of Android,
this is unprecedented.</text><text start="26.7" dur="1.931">So, clearly this was one
of the best announcements</text><text start="28.631" dur="1.639">of the entire Google event,</text><text start="30.27" dur="2.55">and we are finally happy to see that.</text><text start="32.82" dur="5">But on the other hand,
Google has a rich history</text><text start="37.92" dur="4.23">of discontinuing products
and abandoning projects</text><text start="42.15" dur="1.92">and services that have a
lot of people using them</text><text start="44.07" dur="4.14">or depending on them, so how
do we square those two things?</text><text start="48.21" dur="2.28">Like you would think that
relying on a big company</text><text start="50.49" dur="1.86">is better than relying on a small one,</text><text start="52.35" dur="1.89">as far as like supporting
projects down the road.</text><text start="54.24" dur="2.79">Like if I was gonna set up a
new smartphone, for example,</text><text start="57.03" dur="2.16">I wouldn&amp;#39;t wanna set up one
with like a tiny startup</text><text start="59.19" dur="1.86">that I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re
gonna exist in five years</text><text start="61.05" dur="3">&amp;#39;cause then all my smartphone
stuff might not work</text><text start="64.05" dur="1.2">when that company goes outta business.</text><text start="65.25" dur="2.34">So, you&amp;#39;d think a bigger,
more established company</text><text start="67.59" dur="2.19">would be more reliable, but it turns out,</text><text start="69.78" dur="2.37">the same problem can
happen when you rely on</text><text start="72.15" dur="2.55">a gigantic company like Google</text><text start="74.7" dur="1.68">because something you
might get invested in</text><text start="76.38" dur="3.03">or start using might just be
like a small rounding error</text><text start="79.41" dur="2.97">for them that they might
just get rid of at any time.</text><text start="82.38" dur="2.13">So, I think the thing
that really summarizes</text><text start="84.51" dur="1.38">this all well is I have a friend that says</text><text start="85.89" dur="2.94">that Google is super willing
to spin up new projects</text><text start="88.83" dur="2.108">and be aggressive and
innovative all the time,</text><text start="90.938" dur="3.382">but if that new project doesn&amp;#39;t
either get a billion users</text><text start="94.32" dur="1.56">or make a billion dollars,</text><text start="95.88" dur="3.48">then it is liable to get axed at any time.</text><text start="99.36" dur="2.25">So, that&amp;#39;s why literally
just in the past few weeks,</text><text start="101.61" dur="3.09">we have seen Google
Domains, Google Jamboard,</text><text start="104.7" dur="3.42">Google Podcasts, and
Pixel Pass all killed,</text><text start="108.12" dur="2.31">all active services with various amounts</text><text start="110.43" dur="2.52">of users just destroyed, just killed.</text><text start="112.95" dur="2.07">And the further back you
go, the more there are.</text><text start="115.02" dur="1.47">Like this, it feels like a running joke</text><text start="116.49" dur="1.02">that Google will announce</text><text start="117.51" dur="1.827">and kill a new messaging
service every year,</text><text start="119.337" dur="2.163">but just keep scrolling back.</text><text start="121.5" dur="2.58">Like there&amp;#39;s entire webpages
dedicated to chronicling</text><text start="124.08" dur="2.94">the long list of things
that Google has killed.</text><text start="127.02" dur="2.76">Remember Google Plus,
remember the Inbox app.</text><text start="129.78" dur="2.07">Remember Hangouts, remember Aleo.</text><text start="131.85" dur="3.18">Remember Chromecast Audio,
Stadia, the list goes on.</text><text start="135.03" dur="2.19">Now, when they kill these
products or services,</text><text start="137.22" dur="2.94">there are often various
degrees to which they&amp;#39;re able</text><text start="140.16" dur="2.28">to replace them or support everyone</text><text start="142.44" dur="1.83">that they just rug pulled.</text><text start="144.27" dur="2.73">So, like something like
Google Play Music, okay,</text><text start="147" dur="2.34">they were launching another
service called YouTube Music</text><text start="149.34" dur="1.44">and it had a lot of congruent features,</text><text start="150.78" dur="2.37">so they didn&amp;#39;t have the need to have both.</text><text start="153.15" dur="2.13">So, they made it easy to
port your entire library</text><text start="155.28" dur="1.32">from one to the other.</text><text start="156.6" dur="1.41">You&amp;#39;d still be missing some features,</text><text start="158.01" dur="1.71">but at least you still
have your whole library.</text><text start="159.72" dur="0.833">So, that was nice.</text><text start="160.553" dur="1.507">There&amp;#39;s a similar thing
with Google Podcasts.</text><text start="162.06" dur="3.57">Like it was a pretty solid
podcast app, but they again,</text><text start="165.63" dur="3.09">wanted to bring those
things into YouTube Music.</text><text start="168.72" dur="1.8">So, they&amp;#39;ve worked on an import process</text><text start="170.52" dur="1.47">and some tutorials for that.</text><text start="171.99" dur="2.07">And like it&amp;#39;s a good effort.</text><text start="174.06" dur="2.1">It&amp;#39;s good to at least try
to do that sort of thing,</text><text start="176.16" dur="1.14">but it&amp;#39;s not always perfect.</text><text start="177.3" dur="1.29">Google Jamboard, you might not have heard</text><text start="178.59" dur="1.761">of Google Jamboard, but weirdly enough,</text><text start="180.351" dur="2.049">the old pro Ultimate
Frisbee team I&amp;#39;ve played on,</text><text start="182.4" dur="1.95">New York Empire, uses Google Jamboard</text><text start="184.35" dur="1.59">for like our scouting documents,</text><text start="185.94" dur="1.53">for like writing everything down</text><text start="187.47" dur="2.73">and players and tendencies
and all that sort of thing.</text><text start="190.2" dur="1.5">And it&amp;#39;s gone now, or at least by the end</text><text start="191.7" dur="0.833">of the year it&amp;#39;ll be gone.</text><text start="192.533" dur="3.517">So, I guess we&amp;#39;ll just
find something else to use.</text><text start="196.05" dur="1.808">Google Stadia, the gaming
service only lasted</text><text start="197.858" dur="1.612">a couple of years.</text><text start="199.47" dur="2.239">The only saving grace with
this one is when it got axed,</text><text start="201.709" dur="2.471">they would at least let
you export your saved data,</text><text start="204.18" dur="2.19">so you could use it on another platform.</text><text start="206.37" dur="3.36">And then, they refunded every
Stadia user for every game.</text><text start="209.73" dur="2.37">But again, there are no alternatives.</text><text start="212.1" dur="1.68">Fun fact, and this is a true story.</text><text start="213.78" dur="3.42">I had literally just switched mkbhd.com</text><text start="217.2" dur="2.7">from Squarespace to Google Domains.</text><text start="219.9" dur="2.1">It was like a big domain transfer process</text><text start="222" dur="2.49">that took like 24 hours and
I was like nervous to do it,</text><text start="224.49" dur="2.94">but I finally did it
and then within a week,</text><text start="227.43" dur="2.07">Google killed Google Domains</text><text start="229.5" dur="4.62">and sold all of those
domains back to Squarespace.</text><text start="234.12" dur="2.46">So, there are no Google Domains anymore,</text><text start="236.58" dur="2.88">but maybe the craziest recent
one would be Pixel Pass.</text><text start="239.46" dur="0.96">Pixel Pass is crazy.</text><text start="240.42" dur="1.35">So, if you haven&amp;#39;t heard of it,</text><text start="241.77" dur="1.86">it was basically a subscription
plan that was launched</text><text start="243.63" dur="3.21">alongside the Pixel 6, and
the idea was you sign up</text><text start="246.84" dur="2.22">and then you pay 45 bucks a month,</text><text start="249.06" dur="1.11">you get the brand new phone,</text><text start="250.17" dur="2.79">and then you get YouTube
premium, YouTube music,</text><text start="252.96" dur="2.67">a bunch of Google 1 storage,
and some other stuff,</text><text start="255.63" dur="1.59">all included packaged together.</text><text start="257.22" dur="3.57">And then, you get a new Pixel
for free every two years,</text><text start="260.79" dur="2.07">which I mean, sounds pretty sweet, right?</text><text start="262.86" dur="1.23">If you use a bunch of Google services,</text><text start="264.09" dur="1.05">they&amp;#39;re all packaged together,</text><text start="265.14" dur="1.292">the overall price would
be a little bit lower</text><text start="266.432" dur="2.638">than if you&amp;#39;d bought all of
these things individually.</text><text start="269.07" dur="1.417">And then, who wouldn&amp;#39;t want to upgrade</text><text start="270.487" dur="3.083">to a new Pixel phone roughly
once every two years?</text><text start="273.57" dur="1.02">Sounds pretty sweet.</text><text start="274.59" dur="2.01">A bunch of people signed up,</text><text start="276.6" dur="5">and then, exactly 22 months
after they announced it,</text><text start="281.64" dur="3.03">so a month and a half before
the first upgrade cycle,</text><text start="284.67" dur="2.01">they quietly killed the program</text><text start="286.68" dur="3.03">and nobody got their free phone upgrade</text><text start="289.71" dur="2.22">because they killed it right
before they were supposed to.</text><text start="291.93" dur="1.92">And there have been no
announced alternatives.</text><text start="293.85" dur="1.26">And the list goes on and on and on,</text><text start="295.11" dur="3.93">but clearly this type of
behavior erodes your trust</text><text start="299.04" dur="1.38">in anything Google.</text><text start="300.42" dur="2.97">Me, personally, I was thinking about maybe</text><text start="303.39" dur="1.32">switching to Google Fi.</text><text start="304.71" dur="1.513">There&amp;#39;s a bunch of other
carriers out there.</text><text start="306.223" dur="1.727">I was gonna maybe try it.</text><text start="307.95" dur="1.86">The integration with the Pixel seems cool,</text><text start="309.81" dur="2.91">but I cannot be sure
that it&amp;#39;ll still exist</text><text start="312.72" dur="1.92">in a year or two, so I&amp;#39;m not gonna do it.</text><text start="314.64" dur="2.91">So, my point is, launching
ambitious new things,</text><text start="317.55" dur="2.82">which is what Google does, is easy.</text><text start="320.37" dur="1.95">Supporting those ambitious new things</text><text start="322.32" dur="2.76">for a long time is hard.</text><text start="325.08" dur="2.55">And this new announcement
of seven years of software</text><text start="327.63" dur="3.24">updates for the Pixel is
the most ambitious software</text><text start="330.87" dur="2.43">support plan we&amp;#39;ve ever seen
in the smartphone world.</text><text start="333.3" dur="2.16">And that&amp;#39;s what makes it so awesome</text><text start="335.46" dur="1.68">and so hard to believe at the same time.</text><text start="337.14" dur="1.92">Like if I was at Google
and honestly watching this,</text><text start="339.06" dur="2.46">I would really want to make
this promise come true.</text><text start="341.52" dur="1.38">I think it&amp;#39;s a great promise.</text><text start="342.9" dur="3.39">Clearly, I hope more companies
see Google&amp;#39;s announcement</text><text start="346.29" dur="2.22">and try to follow and do the same thing</text><text start="348.51" dur="2.25">because making people&amp;#39;s
devices more useful</text><text start="350.76" dur="3.48">and more secure for a longer
time is a win for everyone,</text><text start="354.24" dur="2.85">for the users, for security,
for the environment</text><text start="357.09" dur="1.38">if people use their phones longer.</text><text start="358.47" dur="1.95">So, like if this pans
out, the phones people</text><text start="360.42" dur="3.75">are buying today will
be up to date till 2030,</text><text start="364.17" dur="2.91">which is an eternity in the
tech world, that is so sick.</text><text start="367.08" dur="1.26">So, I wanna give them credit</text><text start="368.34" dur="3.3">for an awesome promise,
but it&amp;#39;s a promise.</text><text start="371.64" dur="3.39">And Google breaks promises all the time.</text><text start="375.03" dur="1.95">That&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at right now.</text><text start="376.98" dur="3.66">I want it to be real, but, but we&amp;#39;ll see.</text><text start="380.64" dur="1.99">Will the Pixel even be
around in seven years?</text><text start="382.63" dur="1.19">We don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="383.82" dur="2.67">The Nexus program only lasted five years</text><text start="386.49" dur="2.272">before they killed that and
then started Pixel stuff.</text><text start="388.762" dur="3.728">And we are on year eight of the Pixel now.</text><text start="392.49" dur="1.222">Will it last seven more years?</text><text start="393.712" dur="1.058">I don&amp;#39;t even know.</text><text start="394.77" dur="2.25">But then actually, this
also ties into another bit</text><text start="397.02" dur="2.07">of a mini trend we&amp;#39;ve observed lately</text><text start="399.09" dur="3.66">that I wanted to talk about,
which is new announcements</text><text start="402.75" dur="4.86">from tech companies that have
features that are coming soon.</text><text start="407.61" dur="0.9">And this isn&amp;#39;t just Google,</text><text start="408.51" dur="1.11">this has happened across the board,</text><text start="409.62" dur="3.15">but this has happened where
a device will come out,</text><text start="412.77" dur="2.91">but then the new features
aren&amp;#39;t available at launch.</text><text start="415.68" dur="3.27">So, reviewers aren&amp;#39;t even
able to test the new features</text><text start="418.95" dur="1.65">until well after the thing is in the wild.</text><text start="420.6" dur="1.68">You know, Google just
did this with the Pixel.</text><text start="422.28" dur="2.55">The Video Boost feature
they talked about on stage,</text><text start="424.83" dur="2.189">that they said is coming later.</text><text start="427.019" dur="2.791">Video Night Sight is also
not available at launch.</text><text start="429.81" dur="1.2">That&amp;#39;s coming later.</text><text start="431.01" dur="1.32">But like I said, not just Google.</text><text start="432.33" dur="2.28">Apple&amp;#39;s done this, actually many times</text><text start="434.61" dur="1.62">with iPhone camera features,</text><text start="436.23" dur="3.18">and they&amp;#39;ve done it again this
year with a bunch of stuff.</text><text start="439.41" dur="2.37">The Journal app on the
iPhone is still not there,</text><text start="441.78" dur="1.38">coming later this year.</text><text start="443.16" dur="2.79">The airdrop transfer
via the internet feature</text><text start="445.95" dur="1.44">is also not in the phones yet.</text><text start="447.39" dur="2.55">That&amp;#39;s still coming later this year.</text><text start="449.94" dur="1.89">And the double tap feature
for the Apple Watch,</text><text start="451.83" dur="1.56">which is one of the biggest new features</text><text start="453.39" dur="2.58">of the entire watch,
was announced on stage,</text><text start="455.97" dur="3">but it&amp;#39;s still in beta a
month later, and coming soon.</text><text start="458.97" dur="1.44">I&amp;#39;ve just noticed a bunch of these</text><text start="460.41" dur="0.99">over the past couple months.</text><text start="461.4" dur="1.77">It kind of feels like
I tweeted about this.</text><text start="463.17" dur="5">It kind of feels like the
gaming industry precedent</text><text start="468.21" dur="1.86">where a lot of gaming studios will release</text><text start="470.07" dur="2.79">like a half finished game kind
of to just get it out there</text><text start="472.86" dur="0.99">and maybe test the waters,</text><text start="473.85" dur="2.19">and if it hooks, then
maybe they&amp;#39;ll throw a bunch</text><text start="476.04" dur="1.77">of patches at it and updates at it.</text><text start="477.81" dur="2.52">But releasing half finished
games is just not great.</text><text start="480.33" dur="1.65">So, I definitely don&amp;#39;t love this trend</text><text start="481.98" dur="3.87">for tech and for smartphones and hardware,</text><text start="485.85" dur="1.77">but for slightly different reasons.</text><text start="487.62" dur="3.18">One, just because it makes
them much harder to review</text><text start="490.8" dur="2.58">if the new feature&amp;#39;s not
out and we can&amp;#39;t test it</text><text start="493.38" dur="1.41">and then we review what&amp;#39;s out,</text><text start="494.79" dur="3.87">but then the big new
feature comes later, tough.</text><text start="498.66" dur="2.37">But I guess I&amp;#39;ll just stick
with the thing that I&amp;#39;ve said</text><text start="501.03" dur="5">from the beginning, which is
never buy a new piece of tech</text><text start="506.37" dur="3">based on the promise of
future software updates.</text><text start="509.37" dur="0.833">Just don&amp;#39;t do it.</text><text start="510.203" dur="1.627">Just buy it for what it is today.</text><text start="511.83" dur="1.68">And if there&amp;#39;s stuff coming
later and it actually</text><text start="513.51" dur="2.01">gets delivered on the
promise, some are better</text><text start="515.52" dur="3">at delivering that than
others, then it&amp;#39;s a bonus.</text><text start="518.52" dur="1.95">It just, it&amp;#39;s an extra value add</text><text start="520.47" dur="2.88">for the thing that you
are already happy with,</text><text start="523.35" dur="1.92">but never buy it just based on the promise</text><text start="525.27" dur="0.87">of future updates.</text><text start="526.14" dur="1.92">So, that&amp;#39;s it, I just had some thoughts</text><text start="528.06" dur="1.62">I wanted to get out into the world.</text><text start="529.68" dur="3.06">Hopefully, Google and Apple
and others are listening.</text><text start="532.74" dur="3.48">Hopefully, they&amp;#39;re able to
deliver on these promises,</text><text start="536.22" dur="1.92">but also, hopefully,
they&amp;#39;re able to deliver</text><text start="538.14" dur="3.518">on things that they promise
at launch when they can.</text><text start="541.658" dur="1.552">And we&amp;#39;ll keep an eye on Pixel.</text><text start="543.21" dur="1.71">I&amp;#39;m testing the phones,
I&amp;#39;ll be reviewing &amp;#39;em.</text><text start="544.92" dur="2.13">Subscribe to see the
review when it comes out.</text><text start="547.05" dur="0.96">That&amp;#39;s it for now.</text><text start="548.01" dur="0.841">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="548.851" dur="2.056">Catch you in the next one, peace.</text><text start="550.907" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
