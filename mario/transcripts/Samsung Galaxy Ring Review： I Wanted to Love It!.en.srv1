<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.196" dur="2.305">(upbeat music)</text><text start="2.501" dur="2.539">- I have learned a lot about rings</text><text start="5.04" dur="1.62">and about myself in the past week</text><text start="6.66" dur="1.83">of testing the Galaxy Ring.</text><text start="8.49" dur="2.25">It&amp;#39;s been an adventure,
I&amp;#39;ve got it resized,</text><text start="10.74" dur="2.04">I&amp;#39;ve had some existential thoughts,</text><text start="12.78" dur="1.71">and at the end I have maybe a hot take</text><text start="14.49" dur="1.62">on smart rings versus smartwatches.</text><text start="16.11" dur="1.882">So, buckle up</text><text start="17.992" dur="5">(upbeat music)
(camera shuttering)</text><text start="26.28" dur="3.18">Smart rings, they&amp;#39;ve been
around for a while now.</text><text start="29.46" dur="3.57">The Oura Ring came out like
10 years ago as a kickstarter,</text><text start="33.03" dur="1.95">but the main point of these,
the whole advantage of it,</text><text start="34.98" dur="2.82">is you can wear it 24/7.</text><text start="37.8" dur="1.95">24 hours a day, seven days a week.</text><text start="39.75" dur="2.16">It has a seven-day-long battery life.</text><text start="41.91" dur="2.25">So, the whole idea, is
you just walk around</text><text start="44.16" dur="2.55">like living life with
a ring on like normal.</text><text start="46.71" dur="3.78">Living, eating, sleeping,
showering, swimming,</text><text start="50.49" dur="1.71">whatever, just with a ring.</text><text start="52.2" dur="1.95">And that&amp;#39;s honestly, the
most impressive thing</text><text start="54.15" dur="1.53">about the smart ring to me,</text><text start="55.68" dur="2.22">is the fact that it gets
so close in dimensions</text><text start="57.9" dur="2.58">to like a regular ring that
some people would wear.</text><text start="60.48" dur="1.74">Now, keep in mind if
you have smaller hands,</text><text start="62.22" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;ll look bigger, but
it&amp;#39;s 2.6 millimeters thick,</text><text start="65.79" dur="2.16">so it kind of bulges around your finger,</text><text start="67.95" dur="1.92">but aside from that, it just looks normal.</text><text start="69.87" dur="2.22">It&amp;#39;s not a tiny ring, but
I mean that it&amp;#39;s still,</text><text start="72.09" dur="1.23">I&amp;#39;m impressed by how much tech</text><text start="73.32" dur="3.06">they shove into this tiny little frame.</text><text start="76.38" dur="2.19">And by tech, I mean a small battery</text><text start="78.57" dur="2.25">and a couple pretty basic sensors.</text><text start="80.82" dur="0.99">But when you put it all together,</text><text start="81.81" dur="2.97">you get this all-day activity tracker</text><text start="84.78" dur="1.95">that you can kind of just put on</text><text start="86.73" dur="1.32">at the beginning of the week</text><text start="88.05" dur="2.43">and then forget about it, not
worry about the battery life,</text><text start="90.48" dur="2.19">just wear it every day, every night,</text><text start="92.67" dur="1.59">and then just get a
ton of valuable insight</text><text start="94.26" dur="2.97">on your health and
sleep and energy levels.</text><text start="97.23" dur="2.04">At least, that&amp;#39;s the ideal use case.</text><text start="99.27" dur="1.98">Now, I have never worn a ring before,</text><text start="101.25" dur="3">so there&amp;#39;s always some
layer of like getting used</text><text start="104.25" dur="2.76">to wearing something on
your finger every day.</text><text start="107.01" dur="0.84">But then on top of that,</text><text start="107.85" dur="1.59">there are a couple other best practices</text><text start="109.44" dur="2.52">like things you should know
about wearing this one.</text><text start="111.96" dur="2.67">So, first of all, there is a
correct way to wear it, okay?</text><text start="114.63" dur="2.22">All the sensors are on
the same side of the ring</text><text start="116.85" dur="2.19">lined up at the bottom
with this little notch.</text><text start="119.04" dur="2.37">So, you&amp;#39;re supposed to
align all those sensors</text><text start="121.41" dur="2.94">with the palm side of your
hand for the best readings,</text><text start="124.35" dur="1.35">and then you&amp;#39;re supposed to wear it</text><text start="125.7" dur="2.01">on your index finger for the best results.</text><text start="127.71" dur="2.49">So apparently, not actually,
on your ring finger.</text><text start="130.2" dur="2.49">So, once you get this right,
you should have all the info</text><text start="132.69" dur="1.92">showing up in the Samsung Health app.</text><text start="134.61" dur="2.55">This is calories burned, steps taken,</text><text start="137.16" dur="1.71">how many miles you&amp;#39;ve covered,</text><text start="138.87" dur="1.83">and it all accumulates it together</text><text start="140.7" dur="3.66">with this one energy
score, which is out of 100.</text><text start="144.36" dur="2.97">So, I was wearing my Apple Watch Ultra</text><text start="147.33" dur="2.55">at the same exact time that
I was testing the ring.</text><text start="149.88" dur="1.74">And so, I&amp;#39;m looking at
the numbers back and forth</text><text start="151.62" dur="2.19">and it seems like the ring and the watch</text><text start="153.81" dur="2.07">are way off from each other.</text><text start="155.88" dur="1.89">Like the ring, I&amp;#39;m just gonna say</text><text start="157.77" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s over counting a
lot of regular activity,</text><text start="161.58" dur="1.56">but then it didn&amp;#39;t count nearly</text><text start="163.14" dur="1.62">as many floors climbed for some reason.</text><text start="164.76" dur="1.8">So, I don&amp;#39;t know, there&amp;#39;s just,</text><text start="166.56" dur="2.37">there&amp;#39;s a big delta between these numbers.</text><text start="168.93" dur="2.61">And then I also at one point
took the ring off for a while</text><text start="171.54" dur="2.88">around 10:00 pm one
day, more on that later,</text><text start="174.42" dur="2.61">but it continued to show heart rate ranges</text><text start="177.03" dur="2.67">all the way you can
see here until 03:00 am</text><text start="179.7" dur="2.31">when I am definitely not wearing it.</text><text start="182.01" dur="1.26">That&amp;#39;s kind of weird.</text><text start="183.27" dur="1.41">You know, I did that challenge a while ago</text><text start="184.68" dur="2.82">of walking 1,000 steps in
a bunch of smartwatches</text><text start="187.5" dur="0.9">and with a pedometer</text><text start="188.4" dur="2.43">and they were all within a
few percent of each other.</text><text start="190.83" dur="2.19">So, I think I lean towards</text><text start="193.02" dur="2.82">trusting the watch over the ring numbers.</text><text start="195.84" dur="2.7">But that brings me to
the importance of sizing,</text><text start="198.54" dur="1.77">because you only get one size,</text><text start="200.31" dur="1.02">you don&amp;#39;t get to adjust it</text><text start="201.33" dur="1.32">like you would with a watch, right?</text><text start="202.65" dur="3.36">So, you might&amp;#39;ve seen this right here.</text><text start="206.01" dur="3.21">This thing is Samsung&amp;#39;s ring sizing kit.</text><text start="209.22" dur="1.71">You can buy this on
their site for 10 bucks</text><text start="210.93" dur="1.08">and then you get a whole bunch of</text><text start="212.01" dur="2.07">different plastic versions of the ring</text><text start="214.08" dur="3.15">and they even have the nubs
on the inside for the sensors.</text><text start="217.23" dur="2.58">So, you try a bunch of these
on and you try to figure</text><text start="219.81" dur="3.06">which one is the most
snug, but won&amp;#39;t fall off,</text><text start="222.87" dur="3.96">and that&amp;#39;ll be the size
of the ring that you get.</text><text start="226.83" dur="2.16">And then you get 10 bucks
off the ring itself.</text><text start="228.99" dur="2.43">So, I bring this up because I totally</text><text start="231.42" dur="3.42">did the size kit thing,
either with the wrong finger,</text><text start="234.84" dur="1.14">I did something wrong,</text><text start="235.98" dur="3.39">because I ended up with a ring size 11,</text><text start="239.37" dur="3.72">which it was a little too big
when I got the actual ring.</text><text start="243.09" dur="2.31">And so, I noticed that
because it was kind of loose,</text><text start="245.4" dur="2.22">it didn&amp;#39;t really feel
comfortable all the time.</text><text start="247.62" dur="3.66">And then there would be like
gaps in my sleep readings,</text><text start="251.28" dur="1.08">which probably just meant that</text><text start="252.36" dur="2.97">it was like pushed off of
my finger while I was asleep</text><text start="255.33" dur="1.77">and it wasn&amp;#39;t actually reading anything.</text><text start="257.1" dur="2.61">So, I got a new size, I got the size 10</text><text start="259.71" dur="1.26">and then it felt much better.</text><text start="260.97" dur="2.49">And by the way, it turns
out the index finger</text><text start="263.46" dur="3.69">is a much better place to
put like a heart rate monitor</text><text start="267.15" dur="2.91">and other sorts of vitals sensors</text><text start="270.06" dur="2.46">than the back of the wrist.</text><text start="272.52" dur="3">This is one of those
weird secrets or whatever</text><text start="275.52" dur="1.83">that nobody really talks
about with smartwatches,</text><text start="277.35" dur="1.14">which is that the back of the wrist</text><text start="278.49" dur="2.88">is a horrible place to
measure any of this stuff.</text><text start="281.37" dur="3.57">But yeah, the ring, that&amp;#39;s
where you should get that info.</text><text start="284.94" dur="1.89">Now, here&amp;#39;s the thing
that using this smart ring</text><text start="286.83" dur="2.49">for a while actually,
taught me about myself.</text><text start="289.32" dur="1.8">All of the benefits are still true,</text><text start="291.12" dur="3.39">like it&amp;#39;s more wearable than
a watch 24/7, definitely.</text><text start="294.51" dur="2.82">It&amp;#39;s got that full week-long
battery life. It&amp;#39;s legit.</text><text start="297.33" dur="1.56">You can basically forget you&amp;#39;re wearing it</text><text start="298.89" dur="1.05">after a few days in a row</text><text start="299.94" dur="2.94">and have lots of ways to wear it out.</text><text start="302.88" dur="0.93">It&amp;#39;s more versatile.</text><text start="303.81" dur="0.96">You don&amp;#39;t have to dress it up</text><text start="304.77" dur="1.89">or dress it down to match an outfit.</text><text start="306.66" dur="2.73">It&amp;#39;s just a simple concave titanium design</text><text start="309.39" dur="1.53">that looks good anywhere.</text><text start="310.92" dur="4.14">There&amp;#39;s three colors, gold,
silver or matte black.</text><text start="315.06" dur="2.67">So, you already know this matte black one</text><text start="317.73" dur="0.87">feels right at home.</text><text start="318.6" dur="2.19">I&amp;#39;ve just discovered that I&amp;#39;m not</text><text start="320.79" dur="3.3">a big smart ring person myself.</text><text start="324.09" dur="1.14">That&amp;#39;s just what it&amp;#39;s come down to.</text><text start="325.23" dur="1.59">The main thing is the activities</text><text start="326.82" dur="2.64">that I do that I care about the most,</text><text start="329.46" dur="3">I can&amp;#39;t have anything on my hands.</text><text start="332.46" dur="2.58">Like number one, ultimate Frisbee,</text><text start="335.04" dur="2.37">a lot of throwing, a lot of catching.</text><text start="337.41" dur="3.57">Golf, where the ring
again just doesn&amp;#39;t work.</text><text start="340.98" dur="3.75">And weight training, a lot of grip stuff,</text><text start="344.73" dur="1.05">just can&amp;#39;t have a ring on.</text><text start="345.78" dur="2.07">So, for each of those
major workout activities,</text><text start="347.85" dur="1.86">I take the ring off,</text><text start="349.71" dur="3.69">which defeats the purpose
of a fitness tracker</text><text start="353.4" dur="2.16">that&amp;#39;s supposed to know
everything about my fitness</text><text start="355.56" dur="2.76">when it&amp;#39;s not tracking the
most workout stuff that I do.</text><text start="358.32" dur="1.56">Now, I did keep the ring on for some other</text><text start="359.88" dur="1.53">like lighter plyo workouts,</text><text start="361.41" dur="2.37">and there is auto workout detection,</text><text start="363.78" dur="1.5">but with the lighter workouts</text><text start="365.28" dur="1.56">like where you&amp;#39;re not moving quickly</text><text start="366.84" dur="2.46">and your heart rate doesn&amp;#39;t
spike up super high,</text><text start="369.3" dur="3.12">then the auto workout detection
didn&amp;#39;t work super well,</text><text start="372.42" dur="0.84">at least for me.</text><text start="373.26" dur="1.44">And same thing for sleep tracking,</text><text start="374.7" dur="2.07">I had a couple of days
on here where it thinks</text><text start="376.77" dur="2.37">I actually, didn&amp;#39;t go
to sleep until midnight</text><text start="379.14" dur="1.29">when I was actually in bed</text><text start="380.43" dur="1.007">earlier than that with the ring on.</text><text start="381.437" dur="1.483">I just didn&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="382.92" dur="1.62">And I can see the exact numbers,</text><text start="384.54" dur="3.33">because the smart mattress
cover, the Eight Sleep,</text><text start="387.87" dur="2.16">did pick up everything,
which is a great segue,</text><text start="390.03" dur="2.46">because this video is
sponsored by Eight Sleep.</text><text start="392.49" dur="1.26">So, I was recently telling you guys</text><text start="393.75" dur="2.37">how the two times better
cooling performance</text><text start="396.12" dur="1.92">was helping me actually, sleep better</text><text start="398.04" dur="3.48">and getting more 100 sleep
scores, which it still is,</text><text start="401.52" dur="1.8">but also the autopilot intelligence</text><text start="403.32" dur="2.28">automatically adjust the
temperature throughout the night</text><text start="405.6" dur="3.3">and the elevation on the Ultra
responding to sensor readings</text><text start="408.9" dur="2.01">to find the optimal sleep conditions.</text><text start="410.91" dur="3.66">So altogether, the Pod 4s
tech is clinically validated</text><text start="414.57" dur="4.05">to increase total sleep time
by up to an hour every night,</text><text start="418.62" dur="3.57">and increase deep sleep
up to 2.5 hours a month,</text><text start="422.19" dur="2.16">and reduce wake up time by
up to three hours per month,</text><text start="424.35" dur="1.56">and is just as comfortable
as the last gen.</text><text start="425.91" dur="0.833">So, I kind of love it.</text><text start="426.743" dur="2.077">So, if you wanna check
out one for yourself,</text><text start="428.82" dur="2.22">you can go to EightSleep.com/mkbhd</text><text start="431.04" dur="3.99">and get 350 bucks off a Pod 4 Ultra</text><text start="435.03" dur="2.64">or 200 bucks off a Pod 4.</text><text start="437.67" dur="0.833">And with that money,</text><text start="438.503" dur="3.607">you could get a whole
smart ring, actually.</text><text start="442.11" dur="3.3">But anyway, my point is,
if I am taking my ring off</text><text start="445.41" dur="2.67">for my most important workout activities,</text><text start="448.08" dur="4.41">then this is not a great
activity tracker for me, clearly.</text><text start="452.49" dur="2.19">And even for my lighter workouts,</text><text start="454.68" dur="1.95">turned out the wrist thing that I have on</text><text start="456.63" dur="1.5">that has a screen on it,</text><text start="458.13" dur="1.83">even though it&amp;#39;s not the optimal place</text><text start="459.96" dur="3.33">and it&amp;#39;s not the optimal
form factor to wear 24/7,</text><text start="463.29" dur="1.68">I can tell it when I&amp;#39;m starting a workout</text><text start="464.97" dur="3.66">and I can actually have it
track the specific sets of time</text><text start="468.63" dur="1.65">where I&amp;#39;m using it for a workout</text><text start="470.28" dur="1.29">that I needed to know everything about.</text><text start="471.57" dur="3.21">So, the ring, I like the idea of it,</text><text start="474.78" dur="2.58">but it&amp;#39;s just not for me,
which is really too bad,</text><text start="477.36" dur="1.17">&amp;#39;cause I love the idea of it</text><text start="478.53" dur="2.43">not distracting me with notifications.</text><text start="480.96" dur="2.4">It never vibrates, it
never makes any noise,</text><text start="483.36" dur="1.11">there&amp;#39;s no speaker in it.</text><text start="484.47" dur="4.14">It&amp;#39;s just this 24/7 ultra
minimal smart wearable</text><text start="488.61" dur="1.5">with a stripped down feature set</text><text start="490.11" dur="1.74">that you can wear for a week at a time,</text><text start="491.85" dur="1.56">like that&amp;#39;s a sick idea.</text><text start="493.41" dur="2.01">And Samsung&amp;#39;s made this
nice little case for theirs</text><text start="495.42" dur="2.85">that charges the ring
inductively from the inside</text><text start="498.27" dur="1.86">and has these clever
little LEDs to indicate</text><text start="500.13" dur="2.76">how much battery is left in
the case and in the ring.</text><text start="502.89" dur="2.67">So, it can charge the
ring up to 1.5 more times</text><text start="505.56" dur="1.6">with its own built-in battery.</text><text start="507.16" dur="4.13">So, it&amp;#39;s not meant to
replace a smartwatch,</text><text start="511.29" dur="1.32">it&amp;#39;s just a different offering</text><text start="512.61" dur="2.64">of a product into the same ecosystem.</text><text start="515.25" dur="1.8">But that conveniently
brings me to my last point,</text><text start="517.05" dur="5">which is they&amp;#39;ve leaned heavy
into the ecosystem thing</text><text start="522.06" dur="1.08">with the Galaxy Ring.</text><text start="523.14" dur="2.91">So, there are some specific
Samsung-only features</text><text start="526.05" dur="3.63">where like you can dismiss
an alarm or take a picture</text><text start="529.68" dur="4.2">with a gesture with your Samsung
phone, which is hilarious.</text><text start="533.88" dur="1.65">I don&amp;#39;t think anyone&amp;#39;s
gonna do that very often.</text><text start="535.53" dur="5">But it also only works with
a Samsung Galaxy phone,</text><text start="542.31" dur="1.59">that&amp;#39;s according to Samsung on their site,</text><text start="543.9" dur="2.97">so that the Galaxy Ring can only be paired</text><text start="546.87" dur="1.38">to a Galaxy phone.</text><text start="548.25" dur="2.46">Not any Android phone,
just a Samsung phone.</text><text start="550.71" dur="2.31">So, I happen to be using
a Samsung phone right now</text><text start="553.02" dur="1.26">and that&amp;#39;s fine and I can test it,</text><text start="554.28" dur="2.31">but if I was using a
Pixel or something else,</text><text start="556.59" dur="1.11">I don&amp;#39;t see what would stop me</text><text start="557.7" dur="2.37">from just picking up an Oura ring,</text><text start="560.07" dur="2.73">or an Ultrahuman ring,
or any of those others,</text><text start="562.8" dur="2.52">which basically, have
the same feature set,</text><text start="565.32" dur="2.37">but work with any Android phone.</text><text start="567.69" dur="2.07">Other than this one not
having a subscription,</text><text start="569.76" dur="1.71">which actually, is pretty sick.</text><text start="571.47" dur="2.67">So, at the end of the day,
this ring is for people</text><text start="574.14" dur="2.37">who already have a Samsung phone</text><text start="576.51" dur="2.61">and who prefer the wearability of a ring</text><text start="579.12" dur="3.42">over the functionality of
something like a smartwatch,</text><text start="582.54" dur="2.82">because a smartwatch
clearly is more functional,</text><text start="585.36" dur="1.38">but less wearable.</text><text start="586.74" dur="2.253">So, this thing is all
about this simplicity,</text><text start="589.98" dur="1.56">which is probably a good time to mention</text><text start="591.54" dur="3.33">the one feature that I
wish the ring did have,</text><text start="594.87" dur="3.69">which is either like some
sort of tiny speaker,</text><text start="598.56" dur="2.52">or maybe some ultra wideband antenna,</text><text start="601.08" dur="0.833">or something like that.</text><text start="601.913" dur="2.287">Something to make it easier
to find, if you lose it,</text><text start="604.2" dur="2.73">because if you do lose it,</text><text start="606.93" dur="2.64">well, this is a really hard to find.</text><text start="609.57" dur="2.28">Like there&amp;#39;s a Find My
function in the app,</text><text start="611.85" dur="3.09">which I can tell you gives
you the rough GPS location</text><text start="614.94" dur="2.73">based on the last spot that it
was connected to your phone.</text><text start="617.67" dur="3.33">And it can light up the LEDs on the inside</text><text start="621" dur="1.38">that it uses to measure heart rate.</text><text start="622.38" dur="2.88">So, if it&amp;#39;s really dark,
maybe you&amp;#39;ll see it visually,</text><text start="625.26" dur="1.59">but if it&amp;#39;s not out somewhere invisible,</text><text start="626.85" dur="1.86">like if it&amp;#39;s in a pocket,
or underneath something,</text><text start="628.71" dur="2.52">or outta sight, then
yeah, you&amp;#39;ve got about</text><text start="631.23" dur="3.03">as good a chance of finding
this as a regular ring,</text><text start="634.26" dur="4.74">which yeah, is what did
actually end up happening to me.</text><text start="639" dur="2.61">The other smaller ring that I was wearing</text><text start="641.61" dur="2.668">before I got this one resized,</text><text start="644.278" dur="2.552">at some point it fell off my wrist or hand</text><text start="646.83" dur="1.8">and I just never found it.</text><text start="648.63" dur="2.43">So, yeah, Samsung, if
you&amp;#39;re watching this,</text><text start="651.06" dur="1.23">sorry about that.</text><text start="652.29" dur="1.65">Hopefully, I do find it at some point</text><text start="653.94" dur="0.87">and I can ship it back to you.</text><text start="654.81" dur="3.54">But that&amp;#39;s my feature
request, along with hopefully,</text><text start="658.35" dur="2.07">not giving me phantom heart rate readings</text><text start="660.42" dur="0.87">till 03:00 in the morning.</text><text start="661.29" dur="1.74">That&amp;#39;s still kind of creepy.</text><text start="663.03" dur="2.91">Anyway, that&amp;#39;s been it.</text><text start="665.94" dur="0.833">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="666.773" dur="0.907">Let me know what you think,</text><text start="667.68" dur="3.011">and I&amp;#39;ll catch you guys
in the next one. Peace.</text><text start="670.691" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
