The Atari was such a phenomenon&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="261.627" dur="1.902">that all there other companies
wanted to make video games</text><text start="263.562" dur="1.769">and get in on the action.</text><text start="265.364" dur="3.637">When it comes to space games,
nobody compares to Atari.</text><text start="269.034" dur="1.502">Excuse me.</text><text start="270.569" dur="1.936">Have you compared them
to Intellivision?</text><text start="272.538" dur="2.803">So a couple years later,
Nintendo comes knocking
and they say,</text><text start="275.374" dur="1.402">&amp;quot;You know, we have this
video game system.&amp;quot;</text><text start="276.809" dur="2.002">People are skeptical</text><text start="278.844" dur="2.87">&lt;i&gt; because Nintendo started out
 as a card company.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="281.747" dur="1.802">&lt;i&gt; They made playing cards.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="283.582" dur="2.036">Do you know how old Nintendo is
as a company?</text><text start="285.651" dur="2.136">I would be guessing
it started in the &amp;#39;70s.</text><text start="287.82" dur="1.602">- 1970s?
- Yeah.</text><text start="289.455" dur="2.102">- 1800s. Yeah.
- Really?</text><text start="291.59" dur="2.303">Nintendo&amp;#39;s been around for
more than a hundred years.</text><text start="293.926" dur="2.002">It was only
in the very early &amp;#39;80s</text><text start="295.961" dur="1.402">they start to think
of themselves</text><text start="297.396" dur="1.535">as a technology company.</text><text start="298.964" dur="2.403">Nintendo just took over</text><text start="301.4" dur="3.27">and started spearheading
the games industry.</text><text start="304.703" dur="3.871">It is the video game craze,
the Nintendo craze.</text><text start="308.607" dur="3.27">Nintendo was the king
of video games at this point.</text><text start="311.91" dur="2.637">You got all these great games.
You got Duck Hunt.</text><text start="314.58" dur="2.035">&lt;i&gt; You got Solomon&amp;#39;s Key.
 You got Castlevania.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="316.648" dur="1.335">Dan:&lt;i&gt; You had Zelda games.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="318.016" dur="1.502">&lt;i&gt; You had Mario games.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="319.551" dur="1.869">You had all the big
Nintendo stars.</text><text start="321.453" dur="2.003">Seth:&lt;i&gt; So when the Game Boy was
 coming out&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="323.489" dur="2.169">&lt;i&gt; there was a little doubt
 that this was gonna be good.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="325.691" dur="3.337">And the designer
behind the Game Boy was this guy
named Gunpei Yokoi.</text><text start="329.061" dur="4.738">&lt;i&gt; And famously he was one day
 on a very crowded train
 in Japan&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="333.832" dur="3.538">and he saw a businessman
just kinda poking away
at a calculator</text><text start="337.403" dur="2.102">&lt;i&gt;to kill time on his train ride.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="339.538" dur="4.104">And he thinks to himself
what if he could actually
have a real mobile game</text><text start="343.675" dur="1.469">he took could take with him
on the train.</text><text start="345.177" dur="2.97">One of the great things
about the early days of Nintendo</text><text start="348.18" dur="3.337">is they really believed in R&amp;amp;D,
in experimentation.</text><text start="351.55" dur="3.27">So Gunpei Yokoi came up
with first the Game &amp;amp; Watch</text><text start="354.853" dur="3.104">which was an interesting
halfway step</text><text start="357.99" dur="2.503">between arcade games and home
games and portable games.</text><text start="360.526" dur="1.936">&lt;i&gt; ( speaking foreign language )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="365.497" dur="1.903">It wasn&amp;#39;t actually any good,
but it was kinda clever</text><text start="367.433" dur="1.301">and fun and people liked it.</text><text start="368.767" dur="1.836">That was the beginning
of Nintendo</text><text start="370.636" dur="2.035">dipping their toes
into mobile games.</text><text start="372.704" dur="2.704">And then taking that forward,
he evolved that concept</text><text start="375.441" dur="2.736">that started with the Game
&amp;amp; Watch into the Game Boy.</text><text start="378.21" dur="1.869">Announcer:&lt;i&gt;

these games that we love so much</text><text start="398.697" dur="2.269">and allow us to take
it with us anywhere.</text><text start="400.999" dur="2.703">If someone came into school
with one of them it was like

with it.</text><text start="413.612" dur="2.036">And I think it&amp;#39;s something
about maybe the design.</text><text start="415.681" dur="1.335">It&amp;#39;s a very friendly design.</text><text start="417.049" dur="2.97">But this thing was made
in the days</text><text start="420.052" dur="3.103">when people were worried

 The Game Boy was developed
 with this philosophy&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1034.365" dur="1.903">that Nintendo really lived by.</text><text start="1036.301" dur="3.837">It was lateral innovation
by withered technology.</text><text start="1040.171" dur="1.969">&lt;i&gt; And what that meant was
 that they looked&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1042.173" dur="1.602">&lt;i&gt; for tech that might&amp;#39;ve been
 around for a couple years.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1043.808" dur="2.803">&lt;i&gt; And the technology was
 mature enough&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1046.644" dur="1.636">&lt;i&gt; that they knew how to use it.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1048.313" dur="1.802">So while other companies
were putting out systems</text><text start="1050.148" dur="2.937">that seemed much flashier,</text><text start="1053.118" dur="1.668">they didn&amp;#39;t really know
how to use all that flash.</text><text start="1054.819" dur="3.271">Dan:&lt;i&gt; Nintendo kind of did

 of what you didn&amp;#39;t need.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1062.393" dur="1.235">It didn&amp;#39;t have fancy controls.</text><text start="1063.661" dur="2.103">It had a little D-pad
and two buttons</text><text start="1065.797" dur="0.968">and that was basically it.</text><text start="1066.798" dur="1.635">It had very simple audio.</text><text start="1068.466" dur="1.736">Sherri:&lt;i&gt; And there was a slot

to put together something</text><text start="1180.478" dur="3.27">that flows from top to bottom
and doesn&amp;#39;t sound like trash.</text><text start="1183.781" dur="1.969">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1185.783" dur="1.736">I&amp;#39;m working on the not sounding
like trash part</text><text start="1187.552" dur="1.235">really hard right now.</text><text start="1188.82" dur="2.503">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1195.393" dur="1.468">Okay. All right.</text><text start="1196.894" dur="2.503">Uh... I&amp;#39;m almost there with my--</text><text start="1199.43" dur="3.371">with my masterpiece.
( laughs )</text><text start="1202.834" dur="2.403">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1205.27" dur="1.401">How&amp;#39;d I do?
I mean, this is--</text><text start="1206.704" dur="1.302">It&amp;#39;s pretty good.</text><text start="1208.039" dur="1.936">Let&amp;#39;s bring in
that kick drum, too.</text><text start="1210.008" dur="1.969">Ready?</text><text start="1212.01" dur="2.402">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1214.445" dur="1.869">Boom.
Professional.</text><text start="1216.347" dur="3.504">- I can see a whole club bumping
to this tomorrow.
- Me, too!</text><text start="1219.884" dur="1.802">I wanna see-- I wanna see
what you&amp;#39;ve made</text><text start="1221.719" dur="2.103">&amp;#39;cause this is just me
in two minutes messing around,</text><text start="1223.855" dur="2.669">but you&amp;#39;ve had way more
time and experience.</text><text start="1226.557" dur="1.169">- Let me see what you--
- Okay.</text><text start="1227.759" dur="2.035">- What you got.
- Let&amp;#39;s do it.</text><text start="1229.827" dur="1.169">&lt;i&gt; ( Game Boy chimes )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1231.029" dur="1.936">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1251.616" dur="1.969">Marques:&lt;i&gt;
 I definitely didn&amp;#39;t expect&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1253.618" dur="3.804">&lt;i&gt; you could squeeze music this
 fresh out of tech this old.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1257.455" dur="2.236">&lt;i&gt;Considering the short lifecycle
 of most tech around today,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1259.724" dur="5.573">&lt;i&gt; the legacy of the Game Boy
 truly feels like
 something special.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1265.33" dur="3.036">So, I guess the last thing
I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out is</text><text start="1268.399" dur="3.404">the impact these things had
on the tech we have today.</text><text start="1271.836" dur="2.87">What do you think
the Game Boy legacy is?</text><text start="1274.739" dur="3.704">The Game Boy&amp;#39;s legacy,
it&amp;#39;s hard to overstate.</text><text start="1278.476" dur="1.969">Without the Game Boy
you don&amp;#39;t have the iPhone.</text><text start="1280.478" dur="1.535">You don&amp;#39;t have Candy Crush Saga.</text><text start="1282.046" dur="3.437">You don&amp;#39;t have smartphone
gaming. You just don&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="1285.516" dur="3.204">The Game Boy singlehandedly
changed technology forever.</text><text start="1288.753" dur="3.671">Margaret:&lt;i&gt; And the Game Boy was
 the beginning of the idea&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1292.457" dur="3.136">of that everywhere we go in life
have a thing in our pocket</text><text start="1295.626" dur="2.403">that knew how to entertain us.</text><text start="1298.062" dur="2.903">Seth:&lt;i&gt; I mean, the Game Boy
 gave us control of free time.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1300.998" dur="1.669">It changed what free time was.</text><text start="1302.7" dur="2.67">Dan:&lt;i&gt; You would not see everyone
 on their iPhones&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1305.403" dur="3.57">if not for the Game Boy
and the huge influence
it had on our culture.</text><text start="1309.006" dur="2.67">&lt;i&gt; And I think the legacy
 of the Game Boy&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1311.709" dur="4.138">is that minimalism in technology
design is a feature, not a bug.</text><text start="1315.88" dur="2.57">Margaret:&lt;i&gt; I think we&amp;#39;ve now
 kind of come full circle&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1318.483" dur="2.569">&lt;i&gt; to the simplicity and
 the purity of design.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1321.085" dur="2.87">&lt;i&gt; What we saw reemerge
 with the first
 generation iPhone,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1323.988" dur="2.803">&lt;i&gt; an absolute straight line
 that you can trace&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1326.824" dur="1.168">from day one of the Game Boy.</text><text start="1328.025" dur="2.537">This is so Zen. Right?</text><text start="1330.595" dur="5.038">So clean and efficient
and minimalist.</text><text start="1335.666" dur="4.005">Sherri:&lt;i&gt; The Game Boy
 is so well-designed.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1339.704" dur="4.071">&lt;i&gt; So simple that you take
 for granted all the work&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1343.808" dur="4.672">that went into giving you
this piece of tech.</text><text start="1348.513" dur="2.336">When you sell 200 million
of anything,</text><text start="1350.882" dur="2.269">it&amp;#39;s tough to say
it was not a gigantic success.</text><text start="1353.184" dur="2.636">The Game Boy,
besides being a huge seller,</text><text start="1355.853" dur="2.036">&lt;i&gt;has made all of us into gamers.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1357.922" dur="2.069">Sherri:&lt;i&gt; And it became this
 worldwide phenomenon&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1360.024" dur="1.936">thanks to the Game Boy.</text><text start="1366.097" dur="2.403">So, okay, before all this,
I felt pretty disconnected</text><text start="1368.533" dur="3.003">to the Game Boy
because I hadn&amp;#39;t used one.</text><text start="1371.569" dur="2.036">But now that I&amp;#39;ve talked
to people</text><text start="1373.638" dur="1.835">who have used the Game Boy
and I&amp;#39;ve used it myself,</text><text start="1375.506" dur="3.504">I&amp;#39;ve experienced the legend
of its durability</text><text start="1379.043" dur="3.371">and its companionship,
now I get it.</text><text start="1382.447" dur="2.302">And not only that, but I also
now recognize the connection</text><text start="1384.782" dur="2.303">between the Game Boy
and the tech we have today.</text><text start="1387.118" dur="2.736">Without this
there would be no this</text><text start="1389.887" dur="1.602">or many other pieces of tech
we have today.</text><text start="1391.522" dur="1.369">&lt;i&gt; This is important.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1392.924" dur="1.735">Thanks, Game Boy.</text><text start="1394.692" dur="1.936">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1399.697" dur="2.47">Hey, what&amp;#39;s up, guys?
