<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.16" dur="3.281">(smooth music)</text><text start="3.441" dur="1.749">- All right, now that
we&amp;#39;re back down to Earth</text><text start="5.19" dur="3.24">after all of that Vision Pro launch stuff,</text><text start="8.43" dur="1.41">I&amp;#39;ve had a chance to go back</text><text start="9.84" dur="1.68">and re-pick up some of the things</text><text start="11.52" dur="1.17">that I was testing that got, like,</text><text start="12.69" dur="2.82">interrupted by that week of chaos,</text><text start="15.51" dur="1.5">and there is some really good stuff.</text><text start="17.01" dur="2.43">The OPPO Find X7 Ultra design</text><text start="19.44" dur="1.89">I really like more than I expected.</text><text start="21.33" dur="1.8">The Zenbook Duo, the full screen,</text><text start="23.13" dur="3.18">dual screen laptop for
2024, is kind of sick.</text><text start="26.31" dur="2.01">And there&amp;#39;s some other stuff
that is better than expected.</text><text start="28.32" dur="2.58">But the one that stood out to
me maybe the most of them all</text><text start="30.9" dur="2.91">is this guy right here, the OnePlus 12.</text><text start="33.81" dur="1.74">This may have flown a
little bit under the radar,</text><text start="35.55" dur="1.89">I mean, with everything
that&amp;#39;s been going on,</text><text start="37.44" dur="1.98">but it&amp;#39;s gotten some
improvements from last year,</text><text start="39.42" dur="3.03">and it is priced very competitively.</text><text start="42.45" dur="3.21">Matter of fact, let&amp;#39;s
just start with that. 799.</text><text start="45.66" dur="2.88">And you also get a free
upgrade to the 16 gigs of RAM,</text><text start="48.54" dur="3">half terabyte model for
that price if you pre-order.</text><text start="51.54" dur="2.22">It&amp;#39;s literally already marked
down to that on Amazon,</text><text start="53.76" dur="1.05">so I&amp;#39;ll have a link below.</text><text start="54.81" dur="2.13">Flagship price, yes,</text><text start="56.94" dur="2.13">but when it&amp;#39;s competing
theoretically against</text><text start="59.07" dur="2.943">some of the ultra phones, 1,000, 1,200,</text><text start="63.389" dur="4.831">$1,300, then suddenly, it&amp;#39;s
kind of in the category of, uh,</text><text start="68.22" dur="2.31">dare I say, flagship killer?</text><text start="70.53" dur="2.37">So look, it&amp;#39;s nearly
the same on the outside.</text><text start="72.9" dur="2.46">They found what they like and
they&amp;#39;re keeping it consistent.</text><text start="75.36" dur="2.46">Same shapes, same camera bump circle</text><text start="77.82" dur="1.56">that kind of melts into the side</text><text start="79.38" dur="1.92">with these neural details around it.</text><text start="81.3" dur="1.83">It&amp;#39;s still Gorilla Glass 5 on the back,</text><text start="83.13" dur="1.53">and there&amp;#39;s a new set
of colors and textures,</text><text start="84.66" dur="1.83">but in general, you&amp;#39;d
be forgiven for thinking</text><text start="86.49" dur="2.28">it&amp;#39;s nearly the same as last year.</text><text start="88.77" dur="2.49">Or maybe you wouldn&amp;#39;t, but
don&amp;#39;t let that fool you.</text><text start="91.26" dur="2.58">Upfront, this screen
is I think the biggest</text><text start="93.84" dur="2.34">noticeable physical
difference from last year.</text><text start="96.18" dur="4.14">It gets way brighter, up
to 1,600 nits outdoors,</text><text start="100.32" dur="2.1">and it&amp;#39;s hitting crazy numbers now.</text><text start="102.42" dur="3.09">4,500 nits peak HDR brightness.</text><text start="105.51" dur="1.47">Basically, it&amp;#39;s super impressive</text><text start="106.98" dur="2.61">and extremely readable
outdoors and in any light.</text><text start="109.59" dur="2.52">But it also gets extremely dim too.</text><text start="112.11" dur="2.82">Now, I don&amp;#39;t like that it&amp;#39;s
this curved over the edges,</text><text start="114.93" dur="1.44">like, you can see the light fall off</text><text start="116.37" dur="1.8">and the extra reflections
that come with that,</text><text start="118.17" dur="2.35">but basically, from corner
to corner, this 6.8 inch,</text><text start="120.52" dur="3.62">1440p LTPO Pro XDR display</text><text start="124.14" dur="1.83">is a real upgrade over last year.</text><text start="125.97" dur="1.83">So then the rest of the
upgrades to this phone</text><text start="127.8" dur="3.36">are definitely a case of a
bunch of little changes all,</text><text start="131.16" dur="1.47">like, stacking up on top of each other</text><text start="132.63" dur="3.66">to equal a large
difference from last year.</text><text start="136.29" dur="0.833">Does that make sense?</text><text start="137.123" dur="2.437">Like, that&amp;#39;s what
smartphones are nowadays.</text><text start="139.56" dur="3.45">I remember reviewing the OnePlus 1</text><text start="143.01" dur="2.16">and then the OnePlus 2 the next year,</text><text start="145.17" dur="2.94">and just the gigantic total shift,</text><text start="148.11" dur="2.7">big direction changes
between those two phones.</text><text start="150.81" dur="1.41">Nowadays, it&amp;#39;s just about, like,</text><text start="152.22" dur="1.95">finding a bunch of clever little things</text><text start="154.17" dur="1.65">and stacking a bunch of
little improvements on top of</text><text start="155.82" dur="2.61">each other, just make the user
experience a little better.</text><text start="158.43" dur="1.74">So obviously, if you&amp;#39;re
gonna be a flagship killer,</text><text start="160.17" dur="2.04">you gotta have the newest chip inside.</text><text start="162.21" dur="2.1">So it does, it&amp;#39;s the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</text><text start="164.31" dur="1.95">Not that you&amp;#39;ll notice a
whole ton of difference</text><text start="166.26" dur="2.64">side by side with a
Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 phone,</text><text start="168.9" dur="3.27">but this phone does have
much better cooling as well,</text><text start="172.17" dur="1.62">so it&amp;#39;s giving them some
headroom to play with</text><text start="173.79" dur="1.5">slightly boosted clock speeds,</text><text start="175.29" dur="1.71">and it&amp;#39;s benchmarking right behind</text><text start="177" dur="2.52">the gaming phones and the S24 Ultra.</text><text start="179.52" dur="4.83">In real world use, that just
means this phone is super fast,</text><text start="184.35" dur="2.4">really, really fluid, it&amp;#39;s
a smooth phone all the time.</text><text start="186.75" dur="1.32">Like, this is something OnePlus</text><text start="188.07" dur="1.83">has done really well for a long time,</text><text start="189.9" dur="3.42">even with high performance mode being off</text><text start="193.32" dur="1.62">in the battery settings by default.</text><text start="194.94" dur="1.83">But speaking of battery, this phone</text><text start="196.77" dur="2.64">is definitely prioritizing battery,</text><text start="199.41" dur="1.8">super long battery life, over, like,</text><text start="201.21" dur="1.98">ultra high end performance numbers</text><text start="203.19" dur="2.91">and getting every last
FPS out of the thing,</text><text start="206.1" dur="2.22">and as a result, this is a battery champ.</text><text start="208.32" dur="1.71">First of all, you just
start with a huge capacity.</text><text start="210.03" dur="1.95">So it&amp;#39;s got one of the
biggest batteries ever</text><text start="211.98" dur="1.47">in a OnePlus flagship.</text><text start="213.45" dur="3.15">It&amp;#39;s now a 5,400 milliamp hour battery.</text><text start="216.6" dur="1.41">That&amp;#39;s bigger than a lot of other phones</text><text start="218.01" dur="1.02">that are ultras now.</text><text start="219.03" dur="1.8">And you better believe
they&amp;#39;ve kept their trademarked</text><text start="220.83" dur="1.71">Super Fast Charging also.</text><text start="222.54" dur="1.8">So, it&amp;#39;s technically a split battery,</text><text start="224.34" dur="2.13">it&amp;#39;s dual 2,700 milliamp hours.</text><text start="226.47" dur="3.66">and it can juice up at 80 watts wired.</text><text start="230.13" dur="3.09">This combination of huge
battery, awesome battery life,</text><text start="233.22" dur="2.22">prioritization of battery length,</text><text start="235.44" dur="2.91">and ultra fast charging
honestly makes this</text><text start="238.35" dur="2.04">at least a contender to
think about right now</text><text start="240.39" dur="2.4">for battery champ of the year.</text><text start="242.79" dur="2.43">Matter of fact, if you
just leave this phone</text><text start="245.22" dur="1.98">and all of its out the box settings,</text><text start="247.2" dur="2.28">meaning not in high performance mode,</text><text start="249.48" dur="2.31">just regular performance mode by default,</text><text start="251.79" dur="2.28">1080p, which it is out the box,</text><text start="254.07" dur="1.92">and then just auto frame rate,</text><text start="255.99" dur="2.76">you can get two full light
days out of this phone.</text><text start="258.75" dur="2.1">And then when you finally
do get down to near zero,</text><text start="260.85" dur="2.67">you can charge up to half
battery in like 12 minutes.</text><text start="263.52" dur="1.14">If you wanna go all the way full,</text><text start="264.66" dur="2.31">that&amp;#39;s only gonna take about half an hour.</text><text start="266.97" dur="1.29">It&amp;#39;s just so easy.</text><text start="268.26" dur="1.47">And on top of all of that,</text><text start="269.73" dur="3.24">there is up to 50 watt wireless charging.</text><text start="272.97" dur="2.01">So if you&amp;#39;ve got a
compatible air booth charger,</text><text start="274.98" dur="1.32">you obviously have to buy that separately,</text><text start="276.3" dur="2.34">but the OnePlus 11 didn&amp;#39;t
even have wireless charging</text><text start="278.64" dur="2.07">at all, so this is a gigantic improvement.</text><text start="280.71" dur="2.37">I almost wanna get greedy
and also wish that there was</text><text start="283.08" dur="2.16">Qi2 support for wireless charging,</text><text start="285.24" dur="1.44">but I don&amp;#39;t know about you,</text><text start="286.68" dur="2.31">but Qi2 has felt like it&amp;#39;s off to</text><text start="288.99" dur="2.43">a weird, rocky start,
especially this year.</text><text start="291.42" dur="2.34">It&amp;#39;s been surprisingly
uncommon for any phones</text><text start="293.76" dur="3.39">to support Qi2 with the
magnets and wireless charging.</text><text start="297.15" dur="2.28">This is likely because there seems to be</text><text start="299.43" dur="3">a 15 watt charging limit with Qi2 for now,</text><text start="302.43" dur="2.13">so if you wanna do fast wireless charging,</text><text start="304.56" dur="1.98">you aren&amp;#39;t doing Qi2.</text><text start="306.54" dur="2.67">So yeah, no Qi2 wireless, no magnets,</text><text start="309.21" dur="1.98">but very, very fast charging.</text><text start="311.19" dur="3.9">Either way, way better display,
better chip, better battery,</text><text start="315.09" dur="1.89">and also now the cameras
have gotten an upgrade.</text><text start="316.98" dur="1.89">Now, I&amp;#39;m just gonna say,</text><text start="318.87" dur="2.55">cameras have been a relatively weak point</text><text start="321.42" dur="3.18">for OnePlus&amp;#39;s highest end
phones for a while now.</text><text start="324.6" dur="2.07">We&amp;#39;ve always wanted to
call them flagship killers,</text><text start="326.67" dur="2.55">but people love cameras
in flagship phones,</text><text start="329.22" dur="2.13">and it just hasn&amp;#39;t quite been able</text><text start="331.35" dur="1.47">to match that highest level.</text><text start="332.82" dur="3.39">I&amp;#39;d say now it&amp;#39;s on the
acceptable for a flagship level,</text><text start="336.21" dur="2.7">but it&amp;#39;s not quite beating those yet,</text><text start="338.91" dur="1.26">and that&amp;#39;s still true about this phone.</text><text start="340.17" dur="0.87">Now, this main sensor,</text><text start="341.04" dur="1.35">it is actually very slightly different.</text><text start="342.39" dur="4.56">Instead of the OnePlus
Opens&amp;#39;s Sony LYT-T808 sensor</text><text start="346.95" dur="2.97">is the LYT-808 sensor.</text><text start="349.92" dur="3.3">It&amp;#39;s two more megapixels,
it&amp;#39;s slightly wider aperture</text><text start="353.22" dur="1.26">with the glass in front of it.</text><text start="354.48" dur="2.01">Nevertheless, basically,
these OnePlus 12 photos</text><text start="356.49" dur="0.833">aren&amp;#39;t going to shock you.</text><text start="357.323" dur="1.867">I&amp;#39;ve done some side by side comparisons.</text><text start="359.19" dur="1.56">I&amp;#39;ve even said this before,</text><text start="360.75" dur="2.67">it&amp;#39;s pretty good most of the time.</text><text start="363.42" dur="0.87">It&amp;#39;s pretty sharp.</text><text start="364.29" dur="2.79">It&amp;#39;s a little contrastier
than the OnePlus Open.</text><text start="367.08" dur="1.59">The HDR effect looks fine.</text><text start="368.67" dur="2.52">It just falls apart a little too quickly</text><text start="371.19" dur="2.88">as soon as there&amp;#39;s adverse
conditions, especially low light.</text><text start="374.07" dur="1.56">But here&amp;#39;s the thing,
just for the context of</text><text start="375.63" dur="3.96">that it&amp;#39;s not that far behind,
we&amp;#39;ve already tested this,</text><text start="379.59" dur="2.82">because we did the blind
smartphone camera test last year</text><text start="382.41" dur="2.94">with 20 of the best smartphone
cameras in the world,</text><text start="385.35" dur="2.91">and in that test was the OnePlus Open.</text><text start="388.26" dur="1.35">So yeah, there&amp;#39;s a lot
of software involved</text><text start="389.61" dur="1.14">with these cameras, but basically,</text><text start="390.75" dur="2.01">this extremely similar camera system,</text><text start="392.76" dur="1.23">in the standard light photo,</text><text start="393.99" dur="3.6">it had the third highest ELO
rating behind the two pixels.</text><text start="397.59" dur="2.49">Then in portrait mode, it was also top 10.</text><text start="400.08" dur="2.94">But in low light, it was
fifth from the bottom,</text><text start="403.02" dur="2.82">right around the Sony and below the Razr.</text><text start="405.84" dur="2.34">So in summary, yeah, the
camera system is new,</text><text start="408.18" dur="3.03">it does have new hardware, it
has a new zoom and everything,</text><text start="411.21" dur="3.12">but all together, it is just like</text><text start="414.33" dur="1.08">a lot of the other stuff I&amp;#39;m showing you,</text><text start="415.41" dur="1.32">a little bit better than last year.</text><text start="416.73" dur="2.1">And that&amp;#39;s gonna be good
enough for a lot of people.</text><text start="418.83" dur="2.19">Actually, most people most of the time.</text><text start="421.02" dur="3.03">But if we wanna consider
it flagship, it&amp;#39;s just,</text><text start="424.05" dur="2.76">there is a little bit of a
gap till it reaches the best.</text><text start="426.81" dur="2.88">But I&amp;#39;ll tell you what, they
even more keep stacking it up.</text><text start="429.69" dur="3.09">There are so many little
things about using</text><text start="432.78" dur="2.58">this OnePlus phone that I really like.</text><text start="435.36" dur="3.63">Like, I love that I can
specifically force any app I want</text><text start="438.99" dur="1.74">to be at whatever frame rate I want.</text><text start="440.73" dur="1.77">Like, there&amp;#39;s literally a
list of every single app</text><text start="442.5" dur="2.04">on my phone, and by default,
you&amp;#39;ve probably noticed,</text><text start="444.54" dur="2.43">all of the mapping apps,
like Waze and Google Maps,</text><text start="446.97" dur="2.19">they always, even on every
other 120 hertz phone,</text><text start="449.16" dur="2.22">they always override and run at 60 hertz.</text><text start="451.38" dur="2.16">But on this phone, I can just fix it.</text><text start="453.54" dur="1.83">Just give me all of the frames, please.</text><text start="455.37" dur="2.64">I also love that this phone
has an infrared blaster.</text><text start="458.01" dur="2.7">One of the least common
features in the world</text><text start="460.71" dur="2.85">of a modern smartphone alongside,
like, a headphone jack.</text><text start="463.56" dur="2.19">But yeah, it literally
lets you turn on and off</text><text start="465.75" dur="2.52">and control appliances remotely</text><text start="468.27" dur="2.34">without having to find the
remote, like this TV here,</text><text start="470.61" dur="1.8">or a stranger&amp;#39;s TV, I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="472.41" dur="0.93">It&amp;#39;s the little things.</text><text start="473.34" dur="3.18">I love that this USB-C port
not only supports basically</text><text start="476.52" dur="2.25">the fastest charging we&amp;#39;ve
ever seen on a phone in the US,</text><text start="478.77" dur="4.62">but also supports extremely
fast data transfer speeds.</text><text start="483.39" dur="3.42">This is a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port.</text><text start="486.81" dur="3.45">The names and generations
are horrible at this point</text><text start="490.26" dur="1.05">and incredibly confusing.</text><text start="491.31" dur="2.28">All you really need to know
is that this has basically</text><text start="493.59" dur="3.27">the best data speeds
available from a USB-C phone.</text><text start="496.86" dur="1.71">So if you get the right cable,</text><text start="498.57" dur="2.4">you can get large files, like videos,</text><text start="500.97" dur="1.89">on and off of the device real quick.</text><text start="502.86" dur="1.23">And then a lot of you will probably love</text><text start="504.09" dur="3.9">that this new screen
supports high PWM dimming.</text><text start="507.99" dur="1.56">If you&amp;#39;ve never heard of this before,</text><text start="509.55" dur="1.29">it might not even matter to you,</text><text start="510.84" dur="2.43">but there is a select
fraction of the population</text><text start="513.27" dur="3.27">that is specifically
sensitive to the flickering</text><text start="516.54" dur="2.34">that becomes visible
at super low brightness</text><text start="518.88" dur="2.01">with a lot of these
smartphone OLED displays,</text><text start="520.89" dur="1.62">to the point where,
like, it causes headaches</text><text start="522.51" dur="0.833">and eye fatigue.</text><text start="523.343" dur="2.437">So, some smartphones, including this one,</text><text start="525.78" dur="1.38">are now addressing it with</text><text start="527.16" dur="2.82">super high pulse-width modulation.</text><text start="529.98" dur="1.89">Basically, they still flicker on and off</text><text start="531.87" dur="1.92">to get that lower perceived brightness,</text><text start="533.79" dur="3.39">but much, much faster than
the human eye can perceive,</text><text start="537.18" dur="2.31">2,160 hertz in this phone&amp;#39;s case.</text><text start="539.49" dur="2.31">So, it still appears liquid smooth</text><text start="541.8" dur="2.34">at all brightness
levels, which is awesome.</text><text start="544.14" dur="2.97">If you use your phone in
the rain or when it&amp;#39;s wet,</text><text start="547.11" dur="2.19">you probably already know
how chaotic that feels.</text><text start="549.3" dur="0.93">Like, there&amp;#39;s memes about it.</text><text start="550.23" dur="2.34">Like, it just seems to
kind of act on its own</text><text start="552.57" dur="1.89">when there&amp;#39;s water droplets on the screen.</text><text start="554.46" dur="2.07">But this phone claims that</text><text start="556.53" dur="2.91">with a new technology called Aqua Touch,</text><text start="559.44" dur="3">it will totally remain as usable as ever,</text><text start="562.44" dur="1.71">even with water all over the screen.</text><text start="564.15" dur="1.5">Now, you might have seen the ads for it.</text><text start="565.65" dur="3.48">It might sound ridiculous,
but it actually works.</text><text start="569.13" dur="2.55">It&amp;#39;s not perfect, obviously,
but you can definitely feel</text><text start="571.68" dur="2.25">that it&amp;#39;s dramatically more responsive,</text><text start="573.93" dur="1.8">to the point where I
can actually type things</text><text start="575.73" dur="2.52">on this wet phone screen,
where I just would not</text><text start="578.25" dur="1.92">wanna do that on any
other phone without this.</text><text start="580.17" dur="2.34">Kind of feels like magic.
I am very impressed.</text><text start="582.51" dur="2.19">And then there&amp;#39;s even just
extra little tiny things</text><text start="584.7" dur="3.69">on top of that, like 12
or 16 gigs of fast RAM.</text><text start="588.39" dur="2.22">That&amp;#39;s sick. Future-proof.</text><text start="590.61" dur="3.3">Also, Dolby Atmos with
spatial audio support. Great.</text><text start="593.91" dur="1.17">It also has great haptics.</text><text start="595.08" dur="2.58">Like, all this tiny stuff adds up</text><text start="597.66" dur="2.22">to be a great overall experience.</text><text start="599.88" dur="2.76">But it&amp;#39;s not perfect, right?</text><text start="602.64" dur="1.68">Let&amp;#39;s be real. No phone is perfect.</text><text start="604.32" dur="1.38">But at least I can say about this phone</text><text start="605.7" dur="3.63">that also the downsides are
also a couple small things.</text><text start="609.33" dur="1.83">Like, I, for one, I&amp;#39;ve
already talked about this,</text><text start="611.16" dur="2.07">but I&amp;#39;m kind of over the curved displays,</text><text start="613.23" dur="3.15">so, this one keeping that,
it&amp;#39;s not a deal breaker,</text><text start="616.38" dur="2.25">like, you might even argue
it&amp;#39;s a little more character</text><text start="618.63" dur="2.31">to this phone in the
world of 2024 smartphones,</text><text start="620.94" dur="2.16">but it definitely has its downsides.</text><text start="623.1" dur="2.25">from the glare to the light fall off</text><text start="625.35" dur="1.71">to the drop test durability.</text><text start="627.06" dur="1.74">But okay, fine, they&amp;#39;ve gone curved.</text><text start="628.8" dur="2.4">But then the fingerprint sensor underneath</text><text start="631.2" dur="3.63">is also still a pretty
average optical sensor.</text><text start="634.83" dur="1.86">Doesn&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s
been upgraded in years.</text><text start="636.69" dur="4.23">And then for having the new
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip inside,</text><text start="640.92" dur="1.95">which a lot of other flagships do,</text><text start="642.87" dur="2.19">this phone doesn&amp;#39;t really have</text><text start="645.06" dur="3.84">any of the AI features, like, at all,</text><text start="648.9" dur="1.56">and this is something I
wanted to keep an eye on</text><text start="650.46" dur="1.17">with all these phones coming out</text><text start="651.63" dur="2.52">with this chip early in
this year, which is, okay,</text><text start="654.15" dur="2.82">Qualcomm puts out a new chip,
small performance gains,</text><text start="656.97" dur="4.83">small efficiency gains, but
also huge new AI capabilities,</text><text start="661.8" dur="3.99">and this phone kind of
just skipped the AI part.</text><text start="665.79" dur="1.92">Now, not that that&amp;#39;s a disaster,</text><text start="667.71" dur="2.88">but those were some
genuinely useful features.</text><text start="670.59" dur="3.45">The only one I found on this
phone is in the photo editor,</text><text start="674.04" dur="2.04">and it&amp;#39;s called AI Palettes,</text><text start="676.08" dur="2.49">but it&amp;#39;s just like a color overlay.</text><text start="678.57" dur="1.35">I don&amp;#39;t even really think there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="679.92" dur="2.31">that much AI going on with this at all.</text><text start="682.23" dur="2.97">So, none of that generative
fill, crop correction,</text><text start="685.2" dur="2.07">none of that Magic Editor stuff,</text><text start="687.27" dur="3.87">none of that auto live
transcription of phone calls</text><text start="691.14" dur="2.01">or live translation of phone calls,</text><text start="693.15" dur="2.46">none of that, like, speaker
labels in the voice app,</text><text start="695.61" dur="2.07">none of the auto summaries in the browser</text><text start="697.68" dur="2.49">or anything like that, just none of it.</text><text start="700.17" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s not on this phone.</text><text start="701.003" dur="1.267">And then also, random bug.</text><text start="702.27" dur="3.57">I don&amp;#39;t know, but every time
I&amp;#39;m in the overlay browser</text><text start="705.84" dur="1.98">and I reach up to my
favorite little alert slider</text><text start="707.82" dur="1.98">on the OnePlus phone and change modes,</text><text start="709.8" dur="2.88">it opens a search box,
like, to find in page.</text><text start="712.68" dur="1.83">I don&amp;#39;t know why, they
shouldn&amp;#39;t be connected,</text><text start="714.51" dur="1.32">but it does it every single time.</text><text start="715.83" dur="2.64">But maybe the biggest legitimate
downside of this phone</text><text start="718.47" dur="1.89">when you&amp;#39;re comparing it
to the other flagships</text><text start="720.36" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s going up against is it&amp;#39;s promised</text><text start="723.54" dur="3.03">fewer years of software update support.</text><text start="726.57" dur="1.83">Now, I&amp;#39;ve already gotten a
pretty major software update</text><text start="728.4" dur="1.59">since I started testing this phone,</text><text start="729.99" dur="1.65">big camera improvements and bug fixes,</text><text start="731.64" dur="1.32">stuff like that, great,</text><text start="732.96" dur="2.7">but they are only
promising, only promising,</text><text start="735.66" dur="1.59">four years of software updates</text><text start="737.25" dur="2.28">and five years of security updates.</text><text start="739.53" dur="2.55">Now, that&amp;#39;s fine, a lot of
people will only plan on</text><text start="742.08" dur="1.44">keeping this phone for
three or four years,</text><text start="743.52" dur="2.37">maybe five years before
moving on to the next one,</text><text start="745.89" dur="3.24">but in the world of the
flagships, the Pixels,</text><text start="749.13" dur="1.86">the Samsungs of the
world, even the iPhones</text><text start="750.99" dur="3.42">giving you six or seven
years of software updates,</text><text start="754.41" dur="2.82">this is just notably behind on that.</text><text start="757.23" dur="2.94">And maybe OnePlus didn&amp;#39;t
think it was worth</text><text start="760.17" dur="1.32">the extra resources,</text><text start="761.49" dur="2.16">it doesn&amp;#39;t think people
care that much about it</text><text start="763.65" dur="2.31">to actually spend money on
it to put the resources in,</text><text start="765.96" dur="3.39">but yeah, four or five versus seven.</text><text start="769.35" dur="2.883">So, is this a flagship killer?</text><text start="773.43" dur="0.87">Well, that just depends on your</text><text start="774.3" dur="1.59">definition of a flagship, doesn&amp;#39;t it?</text><text start="775.89" dur="2.22">I think this is probably
the most compelling thing</text><text start="778.11" dur="1.59">about this phone, is going to be</text><text start="779.7" dur="2.13">how competitively priced it is,</text><text start="781.83" dur="2.07">because it&amp;#39;s very similar
in a lot of ways to,</text><text start="783.9" dur="2.97">let&amp;#39;s call it S24 Ultra, right?</text><text start="786.87" dur="2.19">But I&amp;#39;ve seen this phone,
the 16 gigs of RAM,</text><text start="789.06" dur="3.81">half terabyte version,
for 899 on their site.</text><text start="792.87" dur="4.26">But if you pre-order it,
you can get that for 799.</text><text start="797.13" dur="4.77">But they&amp;#39;re also advertising
it in a lot of places for 699,</text><text start="801.9" dur="2.73">because they&amp;#39;re apparently
just giving you 100 bucks</text><text start="804.63" dur="3.36">for a trade-in of any
phone, in any condition.</text><text start="807.99" dur="3.12">So, if you&amp;#39;re going with 699</text><text start="811.11" dur="2.85">and this phone starts at 1,300 bucks,</text><text start="813.96" dur="3.18">then yeah, that is a damn good deal.</text><text start="817.14" dur="2.64">So yeah, I&amp;#39;d just be looking
at what&amp;#39;s important to you.</text><text start="819.78" dur="3.66">I would say if camera is
really important to you,</text><text start="823.44" dur="2.31">or if long-term software support</text><text start="825.75" dur="1.89">is actually super high on your list,</text><text start="827.64" dur="3.09">or if any of those AI features
looked really compelling</text><text start="830.73" dur="1.53">or really interesting
that you&amp;#39;d want them,</text><text start="832.26" dur="2.04">then you&amp;#39;d probably end up going with</text><text start="834.3" dur="1.59">one of those other flagships.</text><text start="835.89" dur="2.34">But for everything else,
like, for performance,</text><text start="838.23" dur="2.64">for a great screen,
for incredible battery,</text><text start="840.87" dur="1.92">super fast charging, ultra smooth,</text><text start="842.79" dur="2.37">like, this phone is better
than you probably think.</text><text start="845.16" dur="1.95">Oh, and on top of all that, OnePlus also</text><text start="847.11" dur="2.04">around the same time has
released this phone right here.</text><text start="849.15" dur="3.48">It looks almost the same,
but this is the OnePlus 12R.</text><text start="852.63" dur="3.06">And this is just a a
budgetedized, budgetized?</text><text start="855.69" dur="3.36">A budget version even more
so than this phone already,</text><text start="859.05" dur="1.65">just basically cutting a few corners.</text><text start="860.7" dur="1.74">A few corners on the camera, right?</text><text start="862.44" dur="3.12">It&amp;#39;s a Snapdragon 8 Gen
2 instead of the Gen 3.</text><text start="865.56" dur="1.83">There&amp;#39;s no wireless
charging, things like that.</text><text start="867.39" dur="3.48">It&amp;#39;s IP64 instead of IP65, whatever.</text><text start="870.87" dur="1.89">It&amp;#39;s a slightly trimmed down version.</text><text start="872.76" dur="4.5">Again, 500 bucks. I&amp;#39;m just saying.</text><text start="877.26" dur="3.03">So, if these phones weren&amp;#39;t
already on your radar,</text><text start="880.29" dur="1.68">they probably should be.</text><text start="881.97" dur="2.73">Thanks for watching, catch
you guys in the next one.</text><text start="884.7" dur="1.073">Peace.</text><text start="885.773" dur="2.583">(smooth music)</text></transcript>
