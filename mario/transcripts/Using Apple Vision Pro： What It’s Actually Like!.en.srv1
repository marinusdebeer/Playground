<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.107" dur="0.833">(upbeat music)</text><text start="0.94" dur="2.51">- All right, so you&amp;#39;ve seen the unboxing.</text><text start="3.45" dur="1.59">Now it&amp;#39;s time for the breakdown.</text><text start="5.04" dur="4.863">What is using the Apple
Vision Pro actually like?</text><text start="13.56" dur="4.65">This is easily one of Apple&amp;#39;s
craziest, most radical,</text><text start="18.21" dur="2.76">possibly dystopian products of all time.</text><text start="20.97" dur="2.4">And I have a lot of thoughts here,</text><text start="23.37" dur="2.07">like I&amp;#39;ve been using it
for about a week now.</text><text start="25.44" dur="1.26">There are some parts of this thing</text><text start="26.7" dur="1.8">that are absolutely incredible,</text><text start="28.5" dur="2.37">and some other parts that feel weird,</text><text start="30.87" dur="2.19">or borderline unfinished.</text><text start="33.06" dur="1.86">There are all kinds of new technologies,</text><text start="34.92" dur="3.54">from a new operating system
to infrared eye tracking</text><text start="38.46" dur="3.15">to virtually reconstructed
versions of you.</text><text start="41.61" dur="3.51">I feel like there are so
many actually new things</text><text start="45.12" dur="2.07">that you have to understand
in order to get a sense</text><text start="47.19" dur="2.61">of what this headset
actually is and what it does.</text><text start="49.8" dur="2.58">So I&amp;#39;m gonna break this
down into two parts.</text><text start="52.38" dur="3.63">This video is all about
using the Vision Pro.</text><text start="56.01" dur="1.71">It&amp;#39;s everything I&amp;#39;ve
learned from the past week</text><text start="57.72" dur="3.54">of wearing and getting used to
this thing every single day.</text><text start="61.26" dur="3.27">But I&amp;#39;m also working
on a more wide ranging,</text><text start="64.53" dur="2.7">possibly more existential, review video.</text><text start="67.23" dur="2.07">But let&amp;#39;s just start with the more</text><text start="69.3" dur="2.19">hardware fundamentals, right?</text><text start="71.49" dur="3.3">Like what is this thing
that I&amp;#39;m holding literally?</text><text start="74.79" dur="2.49">Apple Vision Pro at its core,</text><text start="77.28" dur="1.95">well, it is a VR headset.</text><text start="79.23" dur="1.38">Now, Apple would never say that,</text><text start="80.61" dur="2.43">and they probably won&amp;#39;t like
that I&amp;#39;m saying that word.</text><text start="83.04" dur="1.32">You know, I made an entire video</text><text start="84.36" dur="2.16">about why they refuse to use those words,</text><text start="86.52" dur="3.33">and they&amp;#39;re calling it
spatial computing instead.</text><text start="89.85" dur="0.833">We&amp;#39;ll get there.</text><text start="90.683" dur="2.617">But the truth is it&amp;#39;s a
really, really, really high end</text><text start="93.3" dur="2.25">virtual reality headset.</text><text start="95.55" dur="1.86">It&amp;#39;s something we&amp;#39;ve seen before, right?</text><text start="97.41" dur="3.12">It&amp;#39;s got displays and lenses and speakers</text><text start="100.53" dur="1.89">and fans and buttons.</text><text start="102.42" dur="1.59">And this is a form factor.</text><text start="104.01" dur="2.22">This is a thing that we have seen before,</text><text start="106.23" dur="1.89">but before I even turn this thing on,</text><text start="108.12" dur="1.74">there are clearly several things</text><text start="109.86" dur="2.1">that are a little
different about this one.</text><text start="111.96" dur="1.98">So first of all, it&amp;#39;s made of metal.</text><text start="113.94" dur="3.48">Lots of metal and glass
here, which are high quality,</text><text start="117.42" dur="3.15">but heavy materials, relatively speaking.</text><text start="120.57" dur="2.94">So there&amp;#39;s this precisely
machined aluminum frame</text><text start="123.51" dur="0.96">around the outside.</text><text start="124.47" dur="2.79">And yes, those are intakes
for fans at the bottom.</text><text start="127.26" dur="2.4">And then vents for those fans at the top.</text><text start="129.66" dur="1.68">On the right side,
there&amp;#39;s your digital crown</text><text start="131.34" dur="1.8">that can be pressed in or turned.</text><text start="133.14" dur="3.18">And then on the other side is
just a single larger button.</text><text start="136.32" dur="2.46">So kind of basically the same
two buttons as an Apple Watch.</text><text start="138.78" dur="1.26">And then when you get
a little further back</text><text start="140.04" dur="2.22">on this band here, these little pods</text><text start="142.26" dur="2.97">with downward facing
grills, these are speakers</text><text start="145.23" dur="2.01">which are pointed straight at your ears,</text><text start="147.24" dur="1.59">and work surprisingly well.</text><text start="148.83" dur="3.18">Though of course, it also
means that people around you</text><text start="152.01" dur="2.16">can hear a little bit
of what you&amp;#39;re hearing.</text><text start="154.17" dur="1.26">There&amp;#39;s a little bit of bleed,</text><text start="155.43" dur="2.22">and I have a lot to say
about spatial audio,</text><text start="157.65" dur="1.47">so stay tuned for that.</text><text start="159.12" dur="2.31">But the main event is at the front.</text><text start="161.43" dur="2.237">There is an enormous piece of glass,</text><text start="163.667" dur="3.493">which, yes, is very easy
to fingerprint and smudge.</text><text start="167.16" dur="1.98">And then behind that thing,
there&amp;#39;s this outward-facing</text><text start="169.14" dur="3.21">OLED display and a bunch of
sensors all the way around,</text><text start="172.35" dur="2.43">outside facing sensors that go forward,</text><text start="174.78" dur="2.37">sideways, and straight down.</text><text start="177.15" dur="2.43">And there&amp;#39;s depth sensors,
infrared illuminators,</text><text start="179.58" dur="3.6">lidar scanners, and just
regular old RGB cameras,</text><text start="183.18" dur="2.4">all being processed by an M2 chip</text><text start="185.58" dur="2.16">and an R1 chip inside this thing.</text><text start="187.74" dur="1.53">And then maybe the craziest part,</text><text start="189.27" dur="3.18">inside the headset, there
are a bunch more sensors</text><text start="192.45" dur="3.54">facing your eyes, tracking
your eyes in real time,</text><text start="195.99" dur="2.37">for all the eye control and
everything that comes with that.</text><text start="198.36" dur="3.99">And also then to display a
representation of your eyes</text><text start="202.35" dur="2.52">on the outside of the headset.</text><text start="204.87" dur="1.77">Kinda, we&amp;#39;ll get there.</text><text start="206.64" dur="1.89">But overall, when you put it all together,</text><text start="208.53" dur="3.66">you get a very well made, very high end,</text><text start="212.19" dur="3.96">but also pretty heavy
computer to wear on your face.</text><text start="216.15" dur="3.36">So officially, this headset
with this solo knit band</text><text start="219.51" dur="3.9">when I weighed it, showed up as 638 grams,</text><text start="223.41" dur="2.07">which some of you on Twitter
have already pointed out</text><text start="225.48" dur="4.02">is actually slightly less than
the plastic Meta Quest Pro.</text><text start="229.5" dur="2.88">But that Quest Pro also
has a lot of battery</text><text start="232.38" dur="3.3">on the back of your head as
a sort of a counterbalance,</text><text start="235.68" dur="3.09">so the weight distribution
is very different.</text><text start="238.77" dur="2.31">Also, the Quest Pro is not
that comfortable anyway.</text><text start="241.08" dur="3.6">But the point is this,
for Apple, made the choice</text><text start="244.68" dur="4.32">of taking the battery off of
the headset, which means okay,</text><text start="249" dur="1.38">now there&amp;#39;s nothing on
the back of your head,</text><text start="250.38" dur="2.16">so you can wear it and
lean up against things,</text><text start="252.54" dur="1.68">and that might be an upside,</text><text start="254.22" dur="1.89">but that also now means you have to deal</text><text start="256.11" dur="3.18">with this cable all the time
running up to your head,</text><text start="259.29" dur="3.09">and the fact that it&amp;#39;s
very front weighted now.</text><text start="262.38" dur="1.98">All of the weight is on
the front of your face.</text><text start="264.36" dur="2.61">So this is the battery, as
you saw in the unboxing.</text><text start="266.97" dur="2.43">If you haven&amp;#39;t already seen the
unboxing, that just went up.</text><text start="269.4" dur="1.02">I&amp;#39;ll link it below the like button.</text><text start="270.42" dur="2.52">But this battery is a surprisingly small</text><text start="272.94" dur="2.61">3,366 milliamp hours.</text><text start="275.55" dur="3.03">I say surprisingly small
because a normal battery bank</text><text start="278.58" dur="3.047">of this size, you might
expect to be 10, 15,</text><text start="281.627" dur="1.483">20,000 milliamp hours.</text><text start="283.11" dur="3.57">I suspect there&amp;#39;s a lot of
heat insulation happening here.</text><text start="286.68" dur="3.06">But it comes with a
non-removable four foot cable,</text><text start="289.74" dur="2.58">and a proprietary connector
at the end of the cable</text><text start="292.32" dur="1.95">that will twist and lock to the headset.</text><text start="294.27" dur="1.41">And so the lock is really solid.</text><text start="295.68" dur="1.71">It makes sense that it&amp;#39;s
not just straight USB</text><text start="297.39" dur="1.59">that could get disconnected easily.</text><text start="298.98" dur="2.31">Once you connect it, it starts glowing,</text><text start="301.29" dur="1.26">and then it starts booting up.</text><text start="302.55" dur="2.28">And there&amp;#39;s even a little
Apple logo that displays</text><text start="304.83" dur="2.76">on the outside screen
while it takes, you know,</text><text start="307.59" dur="1.44">a little under a minute to turn on.</text><text start="309.03" dur="1.83">So there is no on or off button</text><text start="310.86" dur="1.71">or switch anywhere on this headset.</text><text start="312.57" dur="2.1">Maybe kind of like AirPods
Max or something like that.</text><text start="314.67" dur="2.16">So if you ever take the headset off</text><text start="316.83" dur="2.55">and put it down, it will
enter a standby mode</text><text start="319.38" dur="2.25">after some time, but it won&amp;#39;t turn off.</text><text start="321.63" dur="3.21">If you wanna turn it off,
you literally have to twist</text><text start="324.84" dur="1.41">and unplug the cable.</text><text start="326.25" dur="2.73">That&amp;#39;s the only way to
actually turn the headset off.</text><text start="328.98" dur="2.55">Now famously already, the battery life</text><text start="331.53" dur="2.64">with this included
battery, is not super long</text><text start="334.17" dur="1.29">on this headset.</text><text start="335.46" dur="2.13">Two to four hours is actually realistic</text><text start="337.59" dur="3.54">for what you can expect for
just like this built-in battery.</text><text start="341.13" dur="1.41">But that&amp;#39;s also kind of right in line</text><text start="342.54" dur="1.26">with a lot of other VR headsets.</text><text start="343.8" dur="2.52">Battery life on VR headsets
is not that great in general.</text><text start="346.32" dur="2.282">If you do wanna use it longer,
the only way to do that</text><text start="348.602" dur="2.908">is there&amp;#39;s USBC port on the battery,</text><text start="351.51" dur="1.92">and you have to plug the battery in.</text><text start="353.43" dur="1.74">So you could plug the
battery into the wall</text><text start="355.17" dur="1.68">for infinite battery life,</text><text start="356.85" dur="1.71">or I guess you could plug it into like a,</text><text start="358.56" dur="2.97">you could daisy chain another
battery into the other pocket</text><text start="361.53" dur="1.35">or something for even longer life.</text><text start="362.88" dur="1.8">But yeah, two to four hours.</text><text start="364.68" dur="1.23">Now at first it seemed weird to me</text><text start="365.91" dur="2.22">that the port is on the
same side of the battery</text><text start="368.13" dur="1.29">as the non-removable cable,</text><text start="369.42" dur="2.31">but I think it&amp;#39;s because
they just want you to default</text><text start="371.73" dur="2.34">to putting this battery in your pocket,</text><text start="374.07" dur="1.26">probably in your back pocket.</text><text start="375.33" dur="2.19">So even if it&amp;#39;s plugged into the wall,</text><text start="377.52" dur="2.58">it can still be in your back pocket.</text><text start="380.1" dur="2.1">You&amp;#39;re just gonna want to
get a longer USBC cable.</text><text start="382.2" dur="4.35">So there are no controllers
that come with this headset.</text><text start="386.55" dur="1.62">Now it does support other input methods</text><text start="388.17" dur="2.97">that are like game controllers,
and mouse, and keyboard,</text><text start="391.14" dur="1.74">and those can be incredibly useful,</text><text start="392.88" dur="2.79">but by default the primary input method</text><text start="395.67" dur="1.98">for everyone using the Vision Pro</text><text start="397.65" dur="2.58">is your eyes and your hands.</text><text start="400.23" dur="2.19">So the first time you put on this headset,</text><text start="402.42" dur="2.67">it goes through this calibration process,</text><text start="405.09" dur="1.5">and it&amp;#39;s pretty interesting.</text><text start="406.59" dur="1.59">So the first time you ever put it on,</text><text start="408.18" dur="2.94">it first adjusts the
distance between the lenses,</text><text start="411.12" dur="1.92">physically moving them inside the headset</text><text start="413.04" dur="1.98">to match the distance between your eyes.</text><text start="415.02" dur="1.8">Then it does this sort of a hand scan</text><text start="416.82" dur="1.14">so it understands your hands.</text><text start="417.96" dur="1.11">And then you go through this process</text><text start="419.07" dur="2.16">of basically looking at a bunch of dots</text><text start="421.23" dur="1.32">all the way around the screen,</text><text start="422.55" dur="2.64">and then tapping your fingers
together to select them.</text><text start="425.19" dur="2.55">Kind of feels like an
eye test or something.</text><text start="427.74" dur="0.833">And then you&amp;#39;re in.</text><text start="428.573" dur="0.937">So first thing you&amp;#39;re gonna notice</text><text start="429.51" dur="2.37">is you can actually kind
of put your hands anywhere</text><text start="431.88" dur="3.15">as long as the headset can see this,</text><text start="435.03" dur="1.86">just your fingers touching together.</text><text start="436.89" dur="2.82">So there&amp;#39;s a lot of pictures
of people using a headset</text><text start="439.71" dur="1.38">with their fingers, like
out in front of them,</text><text start="441.09" dur="1.08">pinching like that.</text><text start="442.17" dur="1.44">But you actually don&amp;#39;t have to do that.</text><text start="443.61" dur="2.55">It&amp;#39;s such a wide angle
because of the sensors</text><text start="446.16" dur="2.43">facing forward and sideways and down.</text><text start="448.59" dur="2.46">You can kind of just
rest your hand anywhere,</text><text start="451.05" dur="1.62">in front of you, in your lap.</text><text start="452.67" dur="1.26">As long as you pinch like that,</text><text start="453.93" dur="2.37">it can generally pick it
up, which is impressive.</text><text start="456.3" dur="1.47">So you&amp;#39;re pinching to control anywhere</text><text start="457.77" dur="1.86">in that 180 degree bubble in front of you.</text><text start="459.63" dur="2.97">And then the digital
crown, you hit that once,</text><text start="462.6" dur="2.7">and the app drawer
comes up, pretty simple.</text><text start="465.3" dur="1.23">Doesn&amp;#39;t seem that impressive.</text><text start="466.53" dur="2.73">But this is actually a peek
at the first really impressive</text><text start="469.26" dur="3.27">thing about this headset to
me, which is it seems to have</text><text start="472.53" dur="3.48">incredible spatial positioning lock,</text><text start="476.01" dur="4.74">and like, it&amp;#39;s really hard
to have you appreciate this</text><text start="480.75" dur="1.17">through a YouTube video.</text><text start="481.92" dur="1.59">Reviewing VR headsets is hard.</text><text start="483.51" dur="1.65">But turn around in the room you&amp;#39;re in,</text><text start="485.16" dur="3.6">and picture a wall or a window</text><text start="488.76" dur="5">just appearing locked in place
in 3D space in your room,</text><text start="493.98" dur="1.53">and no matter how much you move your head,</text><text start="495.51" dur="2.49">or move around, it stays
exactly kind of floating</text><text start="498" dur="0.84">where it&amp;#39;s supposed to be.</text><text start="498.84" dur="2.52">But when I say floating, I
think you&amp;#39;re picturing like a,</text><text start="501.36" dur="3.96">a soft float, but it&amp;#39;s locked,
and that&amp;#39;s how it starts.</text><text start="505.32" dur="3.9">So now you&amp;#39;re in Apple&amp;#39;s new Vision OS</text><text start="509.22" dur="4.41">I would describe this as
kind of similar to iPad OS,</text><text start="513.63" dur="2.73">but way more glassy, and of course</text><text start="516.36" dur="2.61">with the extra dimension of 3D space.</text><text start="518.97" dur="2.43">So hitting a digital crown
will always get the app drawer</text><text start="521.4" dur="3.63">back in front of you, and
then simply look at the icon</text><text start="525.03" dur="1.59">you want and pinch your fingers together,</text><text start="526.62" dur="2.04">to select it and open that app.</text><text start="528.66" dur="2.28">Scrolling is basically as you&amp;#39;d expect,</text><text start="530.94" dur="2.19">you just kind of pinch
and grab in the air,</text><text start="533.13" dur="2.28">and then pull as if it&amp;#39;s on a string,</text><text start="535.41" dur="2.4">and physics let you pull
things through the air.</text><text start="537.81" dur="3.66">It&amp;#39;s pretty intuitive, it&amp;#39;s
responsive, it&amp;#39;s fluid.</text><text start="541.47" dur="1.77">Sometimes it&amp;#39;s kind of bouncy even.</text><text start="543.24" dur="2.1">I would say the biggest adjustment</text><text start="545.34" dur="2.25">is only being able to control</text><text start="547.59" dur="2.1">exactly what you&amp;#39;re looking at.</text><text start="549.69" dur="1.2">And I don&amp;#39;t think people realize</text><text start="550.89" dur="1.53">how often they&amp;#39;re controlling things</text><text start="552.42" dur="2.49">that they&amp;#39;re not exactly
looking directly at</text><text start="554.91" dur="1.86">with other computers and other UIs.</text><text start="556.77" dur="3.63">But with this, you can look
at the button to select it,</text><text start="560.4" dur="1.71">and if you look at the
next thing you&amp;#39;re gonna do,</text><text start="562.11" dur="1.5">you&amp;#39;re no longer controlling the button.</text><text start="563.61" dur="1.86">You have to look exactly
where you&amp;#39;re trying</text><text start="565.47" dur="1.17">to interact with things.</text><text start="566.64" dur="1.53">It takes a few extra brain cycles</text><text start="568.17" dur="2.28">to remember to always be looking</text><text start="570.45" dur="1.65">exactly at the thing you&amp;#39;re controlling.</text><text start="572.1" dur="2.88">So when you open a window
of a Vision OS app,</text><text start="574.98" dur="2.31">like any one of the
default Apple apps here,</text><text start="577.29" dur="2.31">it locks into place, it&amp;#39;s floating there.</text><text start="579.6" dur="2.1">It kind of looks, again, like an iPad app,</text><text start="581.7" dur="3">but very glassy, like this
frosted glass around the UI</text><text start="584.7" dur="1.41">sort of lets you see through a little bit</text><text start="586.11" dur="1.05">to the color behind it.</text><text start="587.16" dur="3.51">And it even sometimes casts
a shadow on the ground</text><text start="590.67" dur="2.91">in the correct Z space,
so it really solidifies</text><text start="593.58" dur="1.77">that it&amp;#39;s floating in front of you.</text><text start="595.35" dur="2.01">All this makes it feel like the window</text><text start="597.36" dur="1.71">is in the space around you.</text><text start="599.07" dur="1.95">Then if you look at the
bottom of the window,</text><text start="601.02" dur="2.88">you get a little bar, you can
always just look at that bar</text><text start="603.9" dur="2.13">and pinch to drag it around.</text><text start="606.03" dur="3.18">So drag it forward,
backward, anywhere you want</text><text start="609.21" dur="2.64">in X, Y, and Z space, and then let go</text><text start="611.85" dur="1.65">and it just stays absolutely locked.</text><text start="613.5" dur="2.85">And then you can look at
either bottom corner to resize</text><text start="616.35" dur="1.65">to make it bigger or smaller.</text><text start="618" dur="2.43">And then finally there&amp;#39;s
a little X at the bottom,</text><text start="620.43" dur="1.74">you select that, that closes it.</text><text start="622.17" dur="3.3">So that is the basics of Vision OS,</text><text start="625.47" dur="1.38">and just using an app.</text><text start="626.85" dur="2.58">Now this entire time, by default,</text><text start="629.43" dur="3.27">and almost any time they
can, passthrough is on,</text><text start="632.7" dur="1.44">which means you have the headset on,</text><text start="634.14" dur="1.83">but you can see with the cameras</text><text start="635.97" dur="1.35">right through to everything around you.</text><text start="637.32" dur="1.53">And I think this is
where Apple really wants</text><text start="638.85" dur="3.3">to normalize the term spatial computing,</text><text start="642.15" dur="2.76">because it feels like augmented reality.</text><text start="644.91" dur="2.67">It feels like you&amp;#39;re always
able to see the space</text><text start="647.58" dur="2.61">around you, but technically
it&amp;#39;s not actually AR,</text><text start="650.19" dur="3.21">because you are still looking
at a reconstructed version</text><text start="653.4" dur="1.8">through a camera feed
of the world around you</text><text start="655.2" dur="2.43">instead of the actual world around you.</text><text start="657.63" dur="2.07">But maybe it&amp;#39;s all just semantics.</text><text start="659.7" dur="3.96">I will say, this is the best
passthrough of any VR headset</text><text start="663.66" dur="2.07">I&amp;#39;ve ever used, and it&amp;#39;s
not even that close.</text><text start="665.73" dur="3.72">Now again, it&amp;#39;s so hard to get
this through a YouTube video.</text><text start="669.45" dur="1.71">It does have screen recording built in,</text><text start="671.16" dur="1.17">so I&amp;#39;m gonna try to use that.</text><text start="672.33" dur="2.4">But imagine putting a headset on,</text><text start="674.73" dur="3.15">and not really feeling like
you&amp;#39;re looking at a screen</text><text start="677.88" dur="1.5">with the real world.</text><text start="679.38" dur="1.29">Because of the pixel density,</text><text start="680.67" dur="1.95">because of the 90 hertz refresh rate,</text><text start="682.62" dur="2.55">and because of the impressive
dynamic range of the cameras</text><text start="685.17" dur="2.22">and the correctly adjusting shutter speed,</text><text start="687.39" dur="1.65">you just almost don&amp;#39;t,</text><text start="689.04" dur="2.1">you almost just feel like you&amp;#39;re looking</text><text start="691.14" dur="1.71">at the real world, not through a headset.</text><text start="692.85" dur="3.3">Also the passthrough is
so close to real time</text><text start="696.15" dur="3.12">that I could legitimately
interact with all kinds of things.</text><text start="699.27" dur="2.4">I could catch items flying at me.</text><text start="701.67" dur="1.95">I even tried playing ping pong.</text><text start="703.62" dur="1.8">It was easy, no hesitation.</text><text start="705.42" dur="2.94">So officially, the R1 chip
is doing all the processing</text><text start="708.36" dur="1.98">of all this stuff and
adjusting the shutter speed</text><text start="710.34" dur="1.14">for different lighting conditions</text><text start="711.48" dur="2.19">and always keeping passthrough latency</text><text start="713.67" dur="3.87">under 12 milliseconds, which
is the lowest in the industry.</text><text start="717.54" dur="3.87">But it&amp;#39;s really combining
that with how close to reality</text><text start="721.41" dur="2.37">the colors and brightness
and everything are</text><text start="723.78" dur="2.37">that keeps it feeling kind of real.</text><text start="726.15" dur="2.19">Basically, the only noticeable restriction</text><text start="728.34" dur="3.66">is super close up items and
objects can get a bit blurry,</text><text start="732" dur="2.61">and then you can&amp;#39;t quite
make out really small</text><text start="734.61" dur="2.52">or fine texts, so you can&amp;#39;t read an email</text><text start="737.13" dur="2.07">or a tiny text on your phone in your hand,</text><text start="739.2" dur="2.07">but you can absolutely text people,</text><text start="741.27" dur="2.46">or read your notifications,
while keeping the headset on.</text><text start="743.73" dur="1.32">If you&amp;#39;ve tried other VR headsets,</text><text start="745.05" dur="1.26">you know how impressive that is.</text><text start="746.31" dur="3.15">It&amp;#39;s just, it&amp;#39;s really good with the tech</text><text start="749.46" dur="2.223">that exists now for VR headsets.</text><text start="752.73" dur="2.28">But you can definitely
still take the headset off</text><text start="755.01" dur="1.98">and be like, oh, it&amp;#39;s way brighter in here</text><text start="756.99" dur="1.59">than I thought it was.</text><text start="758.58" dur="2.22">Either way, that&amp;#39;s all passthrough,</text><text start="760.8" dur="2.46">but if you ever wanna
fully immerse yourself,</text><text start="763.26" dur="2.37">I mean it is a VR headset after all,</text><text start="765.63" dur="3.81">all you gotta do is rotate
this digital crown clockwise,</text><text start="769.44" dur="1.92">just keep turning it, and it will slowly</text><text start="771.36" dur="4.02">dial your environment more and
more into your field of view</text><text start="775.38" dur="2.61">until you dial it all the way
up to fully surrounding you.</text><text start="777.99" dur="2.22">So all of the windows
you might have had open</text><text start="780.21" dur="1.53">will still stay stuck where they were,</text><text start="781.74" dur="4.41">but everything you&amp;#39;re doing
is just on the moon now.</text><text start="786.15" dur="1.59">So yeah, there&amp;#39;s a couple environments</text><text start="787.74" dur="1.41">Apple has built in here,</text><text start="789.15" dur="3.09">most of them relaxing scenic locations,</text><text start="792.24" dur="1.98">like in California somewhere,</text><text start="794.22" dur="2.01">or one really nice one is Mount Hood</text><text start="796.23" dur="1.53">with a little bit of rain falling.</text><text start="797.76" dur="2.85">They&amp;#39;re not quite photorealistic,</text><text start="800.61" dur="2.1">but they&amp;#39;re just short of photorealistic,</text><text start="802.71" dur="3.3">like they&amp;#39;re the most
realistic digital environments</text><text start="806.01" dur="0.833">that I&amp;#39;ve seen.</text><text start="806.843" dur="5">So then the last two big quirks
of the UI, control center.</text><text start="812.25" dur="1.53">So the only way to get to control center</text><text start="813.78" dur="2.4">is to look up, and you can&amp;#39;t just look up,</text><text start="816.18" dur="1.86">but you have to physically
turn your head up</text><text start="818.04" dur="1.62">and look at this arrow
that appears above you.</text><text start="819.66" dur="1.59">So once you see that, you select that</text><text start="821.25" dur="2.13">and then you get your control
center for things like,</text><text start="823.38" dur="3">you know, battery life and
notifications, focus modes,</text><text start="826.38" dur="2.82">and screen recording,
and pairing to a Mac.</text><text start="829.2" dur="3.27">But the other big quirk is text input.</text><text start="832.47" dur="2.88">So you might be wondering
how does text input work</text><text start="835.35" dur="2.82">with no physical controllers?</text><text start="838.17" dur="2.07">So there&amp;#39;s basically
three ways to do this.</text><text start="840.24" dur="2.16">So let&amp;#39;s say you are in Safari,</text><text start="842.4" dur="2.007">and you want to go to mkbhd.com.</text><text start="844.407" dur="2.913">You really want one of those
shiny new Chevron hoodies</text><text start="847.32" dur="1.11">for the rest of winter.</text><text start="848.43" dur="1.23">Great, how do you do it?</text><text start="849.66" dur="3.12">So the first way is to
literally hunt and peck</text><text start="852.78" dur="1.83">poking the keys on the keyboard</text><text start="854.61" dur="2.46">that appears in the air in front of you.</text><text start="857.07" dur="3.48">So this one is tough, because
it literally only reacts</text><text start="860.55" dur="2.1">to your pointer finger on each hand.</text><text start="862.65" dur="1.41">So you actually can&amp;#39;t type fast,</text><text start="864.06" dur="2.04">like with home row or anything like that.</text><text start="866.1" dur="0.833">Not great.</text><text start="866.933" dur="2.257">The second way, though, I
think is actually kind of good.</text><text start="869.19" dur="3.09">It&amp;#39;s at least faster,
which is looking at the key</text><text start="872.28" dur="3.09">you want to interact with, and
then pinching to select it.</text><text start="875.37" dur="2.79">So just looking around
the keyboard like this,</text><text start="878.16" dur="0.9">and selecting the keys.</text><text start="879.06" dur="2.16">And you might be surprised how
fast you can type like this</text><text start="881.22" dur="2.7">if you actually know your way
around a keyboard pretty well.</text><text start="883.92" dur="3.15">I actually prefer this to
poking the virtual keys</text><text start="887.07" dur="2.31">because I at least get a
little bit of haptic feedback</text><text start="889.38" dur="2.13">from my own fingers tapping together.</text><text start="891.51" dur="1.59">But then in Safari, the last way to do it</text><text start="893.1" dur="1.89">is literally to just
look up at the microphone</text><text start="894.99" dur="1.92">and say the URL out loud.</text><text start="896.91" dur="1.56">MKBHD.com.</text><text start="898.47" dur="0.99">And then it just hears you</text><text start="899.46" dur="2.04">and goes to the site pretty quick,</text><text start="901.5" dur="3.3">if it&amp;#39;s a URL that you
can actually say out loud.</text><text start="904.8" dur="4.65">So, what can you actually
do with this thing?</text><text start="909.45" dur="3.33">Like now that we know what
it is, it&amp;#39;s the M2 chip,</text><text start="912.78" dur="2.82">a computer on your face with the displays</text><text start="915.6" dur="2.43">and the lenses inside, and all
sorts of sensors everywhere.</text><text start="918.03" dur="1.68">What can this thing actually do?</text><text start="919.71" dur="2.01">And I feel like the most
common way to phrase that</text><text start="921.72" dur="1.92">is what is the killer app?</text><text start="923.64" dur="1.92">Because that&amp;#39;s, we feel
like we need some sort</text><text start="925.56" dur="4.38">of justification to spend
three, $4,000 on this thing.</text><text start="929.94" dur="3.66">Like applications made the
iPhone what it is as we know it,</text><text start="933.6" dur="1.86">like apps made the iPad.</text><text start="935.46" dur="3.273">So what is the app
situation on the Vision Pro?</text><text start="939.84" dur="3.24">So there are two types of apps
on the Vision Pro, actually.</text><text start="943.08" dur="3.36">The first is apps that
are built specifically</text><text start="946.44" dur="2.16">for the Vision Pro to take advantage</text><text start="948.6" dur="1.98">of its awesome experiences.</text><text start="950.58" dur="2.34">And there are a few of those right now,</text><text start="952.92" dur="2.22">and then there are all the other apps,</text><text start="955.14" dur="2.61">which basically are iPhone and iPad apps</text><text start="957.75" dur="2.16">that happen to be compatible</text><text start="959.91" dur="2.763">because the developer didn&amp;#39;t opt out.</text><text start="963.51" dur="2.28">And the first kind is way cooler.</text><text start="965.79" dur="2.46">So these are Apple&amp;#39;s stock apps here</text><text start="968.25" dur="1.53">that come with the Vision Pro.</text><text start="969.78" dur="3.84">And so these are all, of course,
made just for Vision Pro.</text><text start="973.62" dur="2.7">So they&amp;#39;re gonna have stuff
that takes full advantage</text><text start="976.32" dur="1.44">of what this thing is capable of.</text><text start="977.76" dur="1.5">Apple Music is a pretty classic one,</text><text start="979.26" dur="1.65">like it has all the same functionality</text><text start="980.91" dur="1.32">of any other Apple Music app,</text><text start="982.23" dur="3.03">but in this super glassy frosted window,</text><text start="985.26" dur="2.46">and shows the colors of
whatever&amp;#39;s behind it.</text><text start="987.72" dur="3.78">And you have the sort of sorting
menu on the left hand side</text><text start="991.5" dur="1.2">instead of across the bottom.</text><text start="992.7" dur="1.38">That&amp;#39;s the basic layout.</text><text start="994.08" dur="2.1">Same thing with the Notes
app and the Settings app.</text><text start="996.18" dur="3.03">Very glassy, almost looking
like an iPad app in the air,</text><text start="999.21" dur="2.91">just rebuilt with this
new material design.</text><text start="1002.12" dur="1.95">And then there&amp;#39;s the media apps.</text><text start="1004.07" dur="4.02">So Apple TV and Disney+,
they both come pre-installed,</text><text start="1008.09" dur="2.67">which they have built entire environments</text><text start="1010.76" dur="2.04">inside of them for watching media.</text><text start="1012.8" dur="2.7">And there&amp;#39;s even a small
collection of videos</text><text start="1015.5" dur="1.77">on the Apple TV app that are shot</text><text start="1017.27" dur="1.47">on a new proprietary format</text><text start="1018.74" dur="1.56">specifically for Vision Pro.</text><text start="1020.3" dur="4.53">So it drops you into a space
with a full 180 degree video,</text><text start="1024.83" dur="2.28">and Alicia Keys walks right up to you</text><text start="1027.11" dur="1.95">and starts singing right to your face.</text><text start="1029.06" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s crazy.</text><text start="1029.893" dur="0.833">There&amp;#39;s also the Photos app,</text><text start="1030.726" dur="2.504">which will let you look
at panoramic photos,</text><text start="1033.23" dur="2.61">for example, in this fully immersive view.</text><text start="1035.84" dur="2.16">So you can blow them up to full screen,</text><text start="1038" dur="1.95">and then it gives you a
bit of a parallax effect</text><text start="1039.95" dur="2.31">around the edges, so it
feels like you&amp;#39;re looking</text><text start="1042.26" dur="3.36">into a window of your own
photo and looking around.</text><text start="1045.62" dur="0.9">It&amp;#39;s kind of incredible.</text><text start="1046.52" dur="1.62">And then there&amp;#39;s also
some other really fun</text><text start="1048.14" dur="1.44">third party apps that I&amp;#39;ve tried</text><text start="1049.58" dur="0.99">that were built ahead of time.</text><text start="1050.57" dur="1.71">So Sky Guide, this is a good one.</text><text start="1052.28" dur="2.94">You can look around a real
representation of the sky</text><text start="1055.22" dur="4.17">around you or any of the
constellations would normally be,</text><text start="1059.39" dur="2.7">you can look at it a little
longer and it&amp;#39;ll pop it out.</text><text start="1062.09" dur="1.83">You can pull it outta the sky</text><text start="1063.92" dur="1.74">to get more information about it.</text><text start="1065.66" dur="1.47">It&amp;#39;s a pretty great idea.</text><text start="1067.13" dur="1.92">There&amp;#39;s another one called Jig Space,</text><text start="1069.05" dur="1.59">which is, it&amp;#39;s a sick app,</text><text start="1070.64" dur="1.2">I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;d ever use it,</text><text start="1071.84" dur="2.49">but basically it lets you load 3D models</text><text start="1074.33" dur="2.67">into the space you&amp;#39;re in
and mess around with them,</text><text start="1077" dur="2.73">take &amp;#39;em apart, view them in actual size.</text><text start="1079.73" dur="2.04">And this really takes
advantage of how good</text><text start="1081.77" dur="1.77">the placement lock is on the Vision Pro.</text><text start="1083.54" dur="2.07">And you can walk around,
and really gets you</text><text start="1085.61" dur="2.31">a better understanding
of the scale of things</text><text start="1087.92" dur="2.49">that you don&amp;#39;t get to
see up close very often.</text><text start="1090.41" dur="2.01">And then Keynote is another funny one.</text><text start="1092.42" dur="3.36">So you can of course go
through and edit a Keynote</text><text start="1095.78" dur="1.56">just like normal if you want to,</text><text start="1097.34" dur="2.94">but then they&amp;#39;ve built
this whole environment</text><text start="1100.28" dur="2.34">for practicing your presentation skills.</text><text start="1102.62" dur="1.89">So you press that and it
says, oh, would you like to go</text><text start="1104.51" dur="3.42">to a conference room, or the
literal Steve Jobs Theater,</text><text start="1107.93" dur="2.79">so you can rehearse
talking to your audience</text><text start="1110.72" dur="2.13">with your Keynote slides behind you.</text><text start="1112.85" dur="2.73">It is genuinely incredibly immersive.</text><text start="1115.58" dur="1.62">And there&amp;#39;s already a
bunch more apps like this</text><text start="1117.2" dur="1.35">in the App Store already at launch</text><text start="1118.55" dur="2.97">that are specifically
built for Vision Pro.</text><text start="1121.52" dur="2.91">So they&amp;#39;ll take advantage
of its various strengths.</text><text start="1124.43" dur="3.453">Now, are any of these a killer app?</text><text start="1128.93" dur="0.833">Not really.</text><text start="1129.763" dur="2.647">I mean I don&amp;#39;t, if you&amp;#39;re
looking for any one of these</text><text start="1132.41" dur="2.67">to be the reason why you spend
like $4,000 on this headset,</text><text start="1135.08" dur="2.31">I don&amp;#39;t think we have that yet.</text><text start="1137.39" dur="3.18">But then at least there&amp;#39;s
all the other non-native,</text><text start="1140.57" dur="2.82">but technically still compatible, apps</text><text start="1143.39" dur="1.35">that are in the App Store.</text><text start="1144.74" dur="2.64">And these are gonna look just
like iPhone and iPad apps.</text><text start="1147.38" dur="2.88">Actually, there&amp;#39;s a pre-installed
folder on the home screen</text><text start="1150.26" dur="3.69">when you get this thing
literally called Compatible Apps,</text><text start="1153.95" dur="2.28">and there&amp;#39;s a bunch of
them from Apple here.</text><text start="1156.23" dur="1.74">They look exactly like iPad apps.</text><text start="1157.97" dur="2.52">I&amp;#39;m surprised actually
that more of them aren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1160.49" dur="2.52">fully built out to take
advantage of Vision Pro,</text><text start="1163.01" dur="3.39">but like, Apple Maps is just the iPad app.</text><text start="1166.4" dur="3">And so it would be cool
if there were some fun</text><text start="1169.4" dur="2.79">augmented reality overlay
walking directions type stuff,</text><text start="1172.19" dur="3.06">but nope, it&amp;#39;s all the
exact same functionality</text><text start="1175.25" dur="2.1">that you would find if you
opened this app on your iPad.</text><text start="1177.35" dur="1.2">And you can go to the App Store</text><text start="1178.55" dur="1.59">and search a bunch of the names of apps</text><text start="1180.14" dur="2.61">you already know and love,
and find them by name</text><text start="1182.75" dur="2.13">and grab them, and they&amp;#39;ll
work the exact same way.</text><text start="1184.88" dur="2.43">Crazily enough though, there are already</text><text start="1187.31" dur="3.06">some notable exceptions.</text><text start="1190.37" dur="3.75">No Netflix app for the
Vision Pro, no YouTube app</text><text start="1194.12" dur="3.84">for the Vision Pro, no Spotify
app for the Vision Pro.</text><text start="1197.96" dur="3.48">Apple has kind of a
contentious relationship</text><text start="1201.44" dur="1.29">with a lot of developers right now,</text><text start="1202.73" dur="2.16">especially some of the bigger ones.</text><text start="1204.89" dur="3.84">And so some have made the
active choice to opt out.</text><text start="1208.73" dur="2.04">They&amp;#39;re like, we don&amp;#39;t wanna be there.</text><text start="1210.77" dur="2.85">This won&amp;#39;t be a big enough
platform to matter to us</text><text start="1213.62" dur="1.05">to justify the work.</text><text start="1214.67" dur="0.833">So they&amp;#39;re not there.</text><text start="1215.503" dur="0.907">Now I totally get it,</text><text start="1216.41" dur="2.01">but also now as a Vision Pro owner</text><text start="1218.42" dur="1.5">and someone who&amp;#39;s using it,</text><text start="1219.92" dur="2.22">I&amp;#39;m like, oh, it&amp;#39;s kind of a bummer.</text><text start="1222.14" dur="4.38">I really wanted to be able to
watch a Netflix show offline,</text><text start="1226.52" dur="3.09">downloaded it ahead of time,
but you can&amp;#39;t do that now.</text><text start="1229.61" dur="2.4">But at least, at least
for now, for the record,</text><text start="1232.01" dur="1.53">you can use the browser,</text><text start="1233.54" dur="1.8">and anything that would
work in the browser.</text><text start="1235.34" dur="1.08">So if you pull up Safari,</text><text start="1236.42" dur="2.91">and you get a full screen
4K YouTube video going,</text><text start="1239.33" dur="3.18">and locked in space, or
even in an environment,</text><text start="1242.51" dur="0.833">it looks great.</text><text start="1243.343" dur="1.057">It&amp;#39;s razor sharp.</text><text start="1244.4" dur="2.61">Like, I could totally watch
YouTube videos like this.</text><text start="1247.01" dur="2.73">But you will definitely
be missing the features</text><text start="1249.74" dur="2.67">of having the dedicated
app, like offline video.</text><text start="1252.41" dur="4.35">Honestly to me, the killer
app of the Vision Pro</text><text start="1256.76" dur="4.23">isn&amp;#39;t just an app, it&amp;#39;s
actually the ecosystem.</text><text start="1260.99" dur="1.23">And we knew this was coming,</text><text start="1262.22" dur="3.66">but the second you log into a
Vision Pro with your Apple ID,</text><text start="1265.88" dur="2.52">immediately it starts
pulling all the services,</text><text start="1268.4" dur="1.38">and all the stuff that you&amp;#39;re used to</text><text start="1269.78" dur="2.58">from all the other Apple
devices you already have.</text><text start="1272.36" dur="1.65">And I said this before the
Vision Pro was announced,</text><text start="1274.01" dur="2.01">I was like, this is the most
obvious strategy for Apple</text><text start="1276.02" dur="2.01">because there are lots of people out there</text><text start="1278.03" dur="2.49">who have never considered
buying a VR headset</text><text start="1280.52" dur="2.25">that are considering only this one</text><text start="1282.77" dur="1.38">because they have an iPhone,</text><text start="1284.15" dur="2.61">and this is the one that
works with the iPhone,</text><text start="1286.76" dur="1.68">and none of the others
are particularly close.</text><text start="1288.44" dur="1.98">So all of your iMessages are already here,</text><text start="1290.42" dur="1.77">all of your photos are already here</text><text start="1292.19" dur="1.74">and loaded up and backed up.</text><text start="1293.93" dur="2.28">All your Notes are already
at your fingertips.</text><text start="1296.21" dur="1.5">You already saw the Keynote app.</text><text start="1297.71" dur="2.91">But okay, easily my favorite feature</text><text start="1300.62" dur="1.95">is connecting to your Mac, right?</text><text start="1302.57" dur="1.74">So anytime your Mac is in front of you</text><text start="1304.31" dur="1.8">and it&amp;#39;s turned on, hit that arrow</text><text start="1306.11" dur="1.2">and then there&amp;#39;s this little icon</text><text start="1307.31" dur="2.94">to Become My Mac&amp;#39;s Virtual Display.</text><text start="1310.25" dur="2.19">So I click that, and then pick my Mac,</text><text start="1312.44" dur="2.28">and it pretty much instantly,
it actually blacks out</text><text start="1314.72" dur="3.54">the display of my Mac, and
then turns that display</text><text start="1318.26" dur="3.87">into a 4K window inside of the headset.</text><text start="1322.13" dur="3.09">So now my keyboard and
trackpad still work,</text><text start="1325.22" dur="1.2">even if it is a desktop.</text><text start="1326.42" dur="2.13">The keyboard and the trackpad
still control everything,</text><text start="1328.55" dur="2.76">and you can continue using it
just like a normal computer,</text><text start="1331.31" dur="2.97">but with the ability to
make your new 4K monitor</text><text start="1334.28" dur="4.35">as big or as small or close
or far away as you want,</text><text start="1338.63" dur="1.17">which is super sick.</text><text start="1339.8" dur="2.91">And then the bonus is
you can still open up</text><text start="1342.71" dur="4.65">and place other Vision Pro
apps around your Mac computer.</text><text start="1347.36" dur="1.83">So like you can have your
Mac in the middle here,</text><text start="1349.19" dur="3.06">and maybe you&amp;#39;re editing or
doing some work on the Mac app,</text><text start="1352.25" dur="3.24">and then you have a Safari
window, or Messages,</text><text start="1355.49" dur="3">or whatever else you want
right next to it around it.</text><text start="1358.49" dur="2.88">And then your keyboard
and trackpad can move</text><text start="1361.37" dur="4.23">seamlessly between them
all to control all of them.</text><text start="1365.6" dur="4.2">This, to me, as a Mac user,
the ease of use for setup</text><text start="1369.8" dur="1.56">to make this happen, this feels like</text><text start="1371.36" dur="1.11">the biggest game changer,</text><text start="1372.47" dur="3.18">like the most compelling
futuristic feeling</text><text start="1375.65" dur="1.68">use of this headset to me.</text><text start="1377.33" dur="1.59">Especially on a plane.</text><text start="1378.92" dur="1.53">Oh my god, I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times</text><text start="1380.45" dur="1.68">I&amp;#39;ve had an awkward conversation because,</text><text start="1382.13" dur="1.5">like, I&amp;#39;m editing a video on the plane,</text><text start="1383.63" dur="2.37">the person next to me sees
I&amp;#39;m editing a video of myself,</text><text start="1386" dur="2.28">and it&amp;#39;s kind of weird
and hard to explain,</text><text start="1388.28" dur="2.76">but I&amp;#39;m picturing putting the headset on,</text><text start="1391.04" dur="1.47">the display blacks out,</text><text start="1392.51" dur="1.86">but now I can do all the editing I want,</text><text start="1394.37" dur="1.74">and I can make the
screen as big as I want.</text><text start="1396.11" dur="1.68">So I&amp;#39;ve really enjoyed using that feature.</text><text start="1397.79" dur="1.8">Again, the biggest challenge, though,</text><text start="1399.59" dur="3.6">is still remembering to
look exactly at the thing</text><text start="1403.19" dur="1.41">you want to control.</text><text start="1404.6" dur="3.21">So aside from typing on the real keyboard</text><text start="1407.81" dur="2.13">on whatever window is open, if you want</text><text start="1409.94" dur="3.69">to control something, you
have to be looking at it.</text><text start="1413.63" dur="1.2">Again, it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like a big deal,</text><text start="1414.83" dur="2.22">but when you try it,
you&amp;#39;ll see what I mean.</text><text start="1417.05" dur="3.78">And then also, odd
limitation, one monitor only.</text><text start="1420.83" dur="3.18">From the Mac, one virtual
monitor only at a time.</text><text start="1424.01" dur="2.55">So if you usually run a
dual display setup like I do</text><text start="1426.56" dur="2.52">for Final Cut Pro, big
preview on one side,</text><text start="1429.08" dur="2.19">timeline on the other
side, you can&amp;#39;t do that.</text><text start="1431.27" dur="3.87">You have to use the big one
monitor version of your setup.</text><text start="1435.14" dur="1.71">All right, so you might have realized</text><text start="1436.85" dur="3.18">I&amp;#39;ve left one thing out this whole time.</text><text start="1440.03" dur="2.91">One thing, you could call
it one more thing, sure.</text><text start="1442.94" dur="3.09">It&amp;#39;s one more huge crazy thing,</text><text start="1446.03" dur="3.21">but it&amp;#39;s kind of the defining
characteristic of this product</text><text start="1449.24" dur="2.67">and that is Personas.</text><text start="1451.91" dur="3.96">So in all the advertising
you&amp;#39;ve seen of Vision Pro,</text><text start="1455.87" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s these eyes on the
outside of the headset</text><text start="1459.2" dur="2.76">that looks like they&amp;#39;re
kind of in a passthrough,</text><text start="1461.96" dur="3">like in a dark astronaut
helmet type of thing.</text><text start="1464.96" dur="2.46">Easily the most memed, most unique aspect</text><text start="1467.42" dur="1.17">of this headset, right?</text><text start="1468.59" dur="2.46">It&amp;#39;s the only headset
with an outward display.</text><text start="1471.05" dur="3.33">And I mean it&amp;#39;s very, very
prominent in those videos,</text><text start="1474.38" dur="2.61">but in real life, as you&amp;#39;ve started to see</text><text start="1476.99" dur="3.78">from some of my footage,
it is very different,</text><text start="1480.77" dur="1.74">and I think I figured out why.</text><text start="1482.51" dur="2.76">So first of all, it&amp;#39;s not
actually see-through, right?</text><text start="1485.27" dur="1.41">There&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of computer</text><text start="1486.68" dur="1.59">in between me and you right now.</text><text start="1488.27" dur="2.34">So the eyes aren&amp;#39;t on the outside.</text><text start="1490.61" dur="2.55">It&amp;#39;s a representation of my eyes</text><text start="1493.16" dur="2.52">based on what all the sensors
on the inside are seeing.</text><text start="1495.68" dur="1.47">It&amp;#39;s reconstructing it on the outside.</text><text start="1497.15" dur="3.51">So those sensors are tracking
at 90 frames per second,</text><text start="1500.66" dur="2.64">and they give you optic ID, which is,</text><text start="1503.3" dur="2.07">it&amp;#39;s how you log into the
headset and keep things secure.</text><text start="1505.37" dur="3.51">It&amp;#39;s basically the same
as face ID, or touch ID,</text><text start="1508.88" dur="2.25">it&amp;#39;s just looking at and
identifying your eyes.</text><text start="1511.13" dur="4.8">And it also powers the one
beta feature of this headset,</text><text start="1515.93" dur="4.74">which is Personas, which
is, it&amp;#39;s the most impressive</text><text start="1520.67" dur="2.97">and weirdest thing about this
headset at the same time.</text><text start="1523.64" dur="0.9">I&amp;#39;m calling it right now.</text><text start="1524.54" dur="2.16">So the purpose of the eyes on the outside</text><text start="1526.7" dur="2.91">is really not for you,
the wearer of the headset.</text><text start="1529.61" dur="1.26">In fact, you&amp;#39;ll never see it.</text><text start="1530.87" dur="1.53">But it&amp;#39;s for the people around you.</text><text start="1532.4" dur="2.31">So when you&amp;#39;re in a passthrough mode,</text><text start="1534.71" dur="2.16">your eyes will shine through</text><text start="1536.87" dur="2.52">to indicate that you wearing the headset</text><text start="1539.39" dur="2.04">can see the person outside.</text><text start="1541.43" dur="2.43">So that right there is
already pretty unique.</text><text start="1543.86" dur="1.98">But then, when you&amp;#39;re
in something immersive</text><text start="1545.84" dur="2.64">and you can&amp;#39;t see what&amp;#39;s around
you, it covers up your eyes</text><text start="1548.48" dur="3.54">with this sort of like a blue,
purple glowing animation.</text><text start="1552.02" dur="1.38">So that intuitively makes sense.</text><text start="1553.4" dur="1.32">You can see the eyes
when they can see you,</text><text start="1554.72" dur="1.47">you can&amp;#39;t see the eyes
when they can&amp;#39;t see you.</text><text start="1556.19" dur="1.71">But crazily enough, there&amp;#39;s also a feature</text><text start="1557.9" dur="3.03">where if you have someone
who&amp;#39;s outside the headset</text><text start="1560.93" dur="1.35">looking at you, talking to you,</text><text start="1562.28" dur="1.83">and you are in an immersion,</text><text start="1564.11" dur="4.11">but you want to talk to them through that,</text><text start="1568.22" dur="3.12">they will kind of appear through the fog</text><text start="1571.34" dur="2.49">of whatever immersive
environment you&amp;#39;re in.</text><text start="1573.83" dur="2.43">So you just start talking and
looking in their direction.</text><text start="1576.26" dur="3.81">It detects that, and sort of
parts a little bit of a fog</text><text start="1580.07" dur="3">and that person&amp;#39;s eyes
will show through the fog.</text><text start="1583.07" dur="1.02">It&amp;#39;s pretty decent.</text><text start="1584.09" dur="2.67">It basically only shows
one person at a time.</text><text start="1586.76" dur="3.09">And when this is happening on
the outside of the headset,</text><text start="1589.85" dur="2.52">it shows a little bit of
your eyes poking through</text><text start="1592.37" dur="2.79">the purple and blue glow.</text><text start="1595.16" dur="3">It&amp;#39;s, as you can see, it&amp;#39;s all working,</text><text start="1598.16" dur="3.6">but also, I think it looks
nothing like the eyes</text><text start="1601.76" dur="0.833">from the ad.</text><text start="1602.593" dur="2.137">So in an effort to make the eyes</text><text start="1604.73" dur="2.7">as presentable as possible, two things.</text><text start="1607.43" dur="2.61">First of all, this
screen is actually behind</text><text start="1610.04" dur="3.6">a lenticular film, which
I didn&amp;#39;t even realize that</text><text start="1613.64" dur="1.74">from the initial media they had published.</text><text start="1615.38" dur="1.32">But if you&amp;#39;ve ever heard of that,</text><text start="1616.7" dur="2.64">it&amp;#39;s sort of what gives it this 3D depth.</text><text start="1619.34" dur="2.52">You might have seen this on
other holographic displays</text><text start="1621.86" dur="1.41">and stuff, but the point of that</text><text start="1623.27" dur="4.08">is to make the eyes appear to
be sunken into the display,</text><text start="1627.35" dur="1.83">like on your actual face,</text><text start="1629.18" dur="2.88">instead of glued to the
front of the headset,</text><text start="1632.06" dur="1.26">which would look a little more weird.</text><text start="1633.32" dur="3.36">But then two, to represent
your actual eyes,</text><text start="1636.68" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;ve built in a way to scan in</text><text start="1639.65" dur="3.24">and create a digital
representation of your face,</text><text start="1642.89" dur="2.22">which is called your Persona.</text><text start="1645.11" dur="1.05">And it looks like this.</text><text start="1646.16" dur="3.12">So to get those eyes on the outside</text><text start="1649.28" dur="2.1">of the Vision Pro headset,
you have to do something</text><text start="1651.38" dur="2.4">called registering your Persona.</text><text start="1653.78" dur="2.82">This is how it creates
the digital version of you</text><text start="1656.6" dur="3.51">that includes your eyes
that will show up here.</text><text start="1660.11" dur="1.98">So let&amp;#39;s do that now.</text><text start="1662.09" dur="1.53">It&amp;#39;s actually kind of a cool process.</text><text start="1663.62" dur="2.16">So I&amp;#39;m gonna put it on, and
hopefully the screen recording</text><text start="1665.78" dur="1.92">works so you can see
exactly what I&amp;#39;m doing.</text><text start="1667.7" dur="1.14">I&amp;#39;ll hit the digital crown.</text><text start="1668.84" dur="1.47">I&amp;#39;m gonna go to Settings.</text><text start="1670.31" dur="1.65">And you can do this when
you first set it up.</text><text start="1671.96" dur="5">But I&amp;#39;m going to Persona, and
I&amp;#39;m gonna hit Get Started.</text><text start="1677.78" dur="3.12">So let&amp;#39;s refine my hands real quick.</text><text start="1680.9" dur="2.73">This is capturing detail
from the front of the headset</text><text start="1683.63" dur="1.563">of the hands in front of me.</text><text start="1687.17" dur="1.413">Once it&amp;#39;s done with that-</text><text start="1688.583" dur="1.827">- [Automated Voice] Your

your facial expressions.</text><text start="1728.66" dur="2.013">Smile with your mouth closed.</text><text start="1732.44" dur="2.463">Then make a big smile

says Creating Persona,</text><text start="1756.59" dur="1.5">and it says it&amp;#39;s in beta,</text><text start="1758.09" dur="5">and now there&amp;#39;s my Persona right there.</text><text start="1764" dur="2.88">Kind of uncanny.</text><text start="1766.88" dur="3.573">The hair&amp;#39;s a little bit
different, but the face.</text><text start="1773.12" dur="1.14">Wow, wow.</text><text start="1774.26" dur="0.833">Okay.</text><text start="1775.093" dur="0.833">So there&amp;#39;s different lighting.</text><text start="1775.926" dur="1.724">You can choose it to always
be in studio lighting,</text><text start="1777.65" dur="1.53">and always be in contour lighting.</text><text start="1779.18" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;ll just leave it at
natural, and hit next.</text><text start="1783.14" dur="4.14">You can change the color

thing, it barely shows up.</text><text start="1830.54" dur="3.3">You can barely see my eyes
when I&amp;#39;m wearing the headset.</text><text start="1833.84" dur="2.52">Now I&amp;#39;ve tried a couple
other scans subsequently,</text><text start="1836.36" dur="1.86">so I&amp;#39;ve tried different
lighting conditions,</text><text start="1838.22" dur="2.37">I&amp;#39;ve tried different

and things like that.</text><text start="1842.93" dur="1.92">It doesn&amp;#39;t really ever
appear any brighter.</text><text start="1844.85" dur="2.16">I think if you have a
darker skin tone like me,</text><text start="1847.01" dur="3.36">just don&amp;#39;t expect the eyes
to show up very brightly</text><text start="1850.37" dur="1.05">on the outside of the headset.</text><text start="1851.42" dur="1.05">It&amp;#39;s pretty subtle.</text><text start="1852.47" dur="3.51">Even when it does show up,
it&amp;#39;s a little weird looking.</text><text start="1855.98" dur="2.52">The eyes are a little
too far apart sometimes.</text><text start="1858.5" dur="1.17">They&amp;#39;re a little dim.</text><text start="1859.67" dur="1.47">You see one eye at a time.</text><text start="1861.14" dur="1.62">It&amp;#39;s kind of weird.</text><text start="1862.76" dur="2.027">But that Persona though.</text><text start="1864.787" dur="0.833">Whew.</text><text start="1865.62" dur="2.12">That is some pretty interesting stuff.</text><text start="1867.74" dur="4.08">It&amp;#39;s crazy that this is actually
a real thing being shipped,</text><text start="1871.82" dur="1.74">like first Meta started doing it.</text><text start="1873.56" dur="1.59">Now Apple&amp;#39;s doing this.</text><text start="1875.15" dur="2.55">This is, again, it&amp;#39;s technically in beta.</text><text start="1877.7" dur="2.25">So I dunno, there&amp;#39;s room for improvement,</text><text start="1879.95" dur="1.05">but it still works.</text><text start="1881" dur="2.73">But as of right now, I feel like this is</text><text start="1883.73" dur="5">both incredibly impressive
and slightly unsettling.</text><text start="1888.83" dur="3.42">Like, it&amp;#39;s very impressive
that this thing,</text><text start="1892.25" dur="1.44">this headset I&amp;#39;m wearing on my face,</text><text start="1893.69" dur="3.9">is tracking all these
little micro expressions</text><text start="1897.59" dur="2.4">and little movements for
my eyes and my cheeks</text><text start="1899.99" dur="2.13">and my mouth and everything.</text><text start="1902.12" dur="5">But at the same time,
it&amp;#39;s just not quite human.</text><text start="1907.37" dur="2.04">It&amp;#39;s right at the edge
of the uncanny valley</text><text start="1909.41" dur="2.49">of I&amp;#39;m not looking at a person.</text><text start="1911.9" dur="2.28">So yeah.</text><text start="1914.18" dur="4.2">But the crazy part is you
can now use this Persona</text><text start="1918.38" dur="3.48">as your camera feed for
any apps in Vision Pro</text><text start="1921.86" dur="4.74">that require a front facing
camera, like FaceTime.</text><text start="1926.6" dur="2.88">And so I&amp;#39;ve tried, I&amp;#39;ve
been using FaceTime</text><text start="1929.48" dur="1.53">a few times in the Vision Pro,</text><text start="1931.01" dur="4.47">and it is, technically
speaking, incredible.</text><text start="1935.48" dur="2.31">So I&amp;#39;ve made a few FaceTime
calls in the past few days</text><text start="1937.79" dur="1.44">with some fellow reviewers,</text><text start="1939.23" dur="2.49">who you&amp;#39;ll probably recognize
from their Personas,</text><text start="1941.72" dur="2.19">who are also testing the Vision Pro.</text><text start="1943.91" dur="3.63">And universally, once we
all got past the shock of,</text><text start="1947.54" dur="1.86">oh my god, it&amp;#39;s you.</text><text start="1949.4" dur="1.32">It looks like a digital version of you.</text><text start="1950.72" dur="0.833">This is crazy.</text><text start="1951.553" dur="1.567">I&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like this before.</text><text start="1953.12" dur="3.69">Once we got past that, there
is a ton happening here.</text><text start="1956.81" dur="2.37">So you can see the FaceTime windows</text><text start="1959.18" dur="2.01">literally appear as just that.</text><text start="1961.19" dur="2.94">They&amp;#39;re just like glassy
windows floating in space</text><text start="1964.13" dur="1.92">with people looking through them.</text><text start="1966.05" dur="3.48">And then the angle that
you look into the window</text><text start="1969.53" dur="4.56">is gonna match the angle that
they see you looking at them.</text><text start="1974.09" dur="3.24">Meaning if we&amp;#39;re all in
Vision Pros on this call,</text><text start="1977.33" dur="1.65">unlikely, but hear me out.</text><text start="1978.98" dur="2.1">If we&amp;#39;re all in Vision Pros,</text><text start="1981.08" dur="1.95">and you&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of
people on this FaceTime call,</text><text start="1983.03" dur="1.44">so there&amp;#39;s somebody to the left,</text><text start="1984.47" dur="2.79">and somebody to the right,
if I look to the person,</text><text start="1987.26" dur="2.46">and make eye contact with
the person to the right,</text><text start="1989.72" dur="3.78">the person to the left
sees the side of my head,</text><text start="1993.5" dur="2.91">because I&amp;#39;m looking at somebody else.</text><text start="1996.41" dur="1.53">That&amp;#39;s already pretty cool.</text><text start="1997.94" dur="1.86">And then the same thing
is true for hand gestures.</text><text start="1999.8" dur="1.14">So we tried this out.</text><text start="2000.94" dur="1.68">Turns out you can reach out</text><text start="2002.62" dur="2.91">and make hand gestures that
are tracked by the cameras</text><text start="2005.53" dur="1.23">in this bubble in front of you,</text><text start="2006.76" dur="3.03">and they show up at the correct angle</text><text start="2009.79" dur="2.07">towards the person that
you&amp;#39;re gesturing at,</text><text start="2011.86" dur="2.61">so not towards everybody else on the call.</text><text start="2014.47" dur="0.84">Oh wait, wait, wait.</text><text start="2015.31" dur="0.833">Okay, good test.</text><text start="2016.143" dur="1.507">So wait, Justine, do you see this?</text><text start="2017.65" dur="0.833">- Yes.</text><text start="2018.483" dur="0.833">- And Brian, do you see?
- I don&amp;#39;t see that.</text><text start="2019.316" dur="1.034">I don&amp;#39;t see that, Marques.
- Whoa.</text><text start="2020.35" dur="1.373">- Now wait.</text><text start="2021.723" dur="0.833">So now Brian, do you see this?
(Justine gasps)</text><text start="2022.556" dur="1.034">- Now I can see that, Marques.</text><text start="2023.59" dur="2.16">- And then on top of
that, spatial audio here</text><text start="2025.75" dur="1.5">is incredibly well developed.</text><text start="2027.25" dur="3.03">So again, you&amp;#39;re on the
call, the voice of the person</text><text start="2030.28" dur="1.86">to the right comes from the right side.</text><text start="2032.14" dur="2.16">The voice of the person to
the left comes from the left.</text><text start="2034.3" dur="2.67">But also, you can just pick
up and move the window around,</text><text start="2036.97" dur="4.44">and that angle will match where
the people are in the room</text><text start="2041.41" dur="2.25">and where their sound
and video comes from.</text><text start="2043.66" dur="2.64">If I put you on the
other side of the room,</text><text start="2046.3" dur="2.55">it sounds like they&amp;#39;re further away.</text><text start="2048.85" dur="3.15">And if I turn up the environment,</text><text start="2052" dur="4.38">and bring them into the
moon, or some other 3D space,</text><text start="2056.38" dur="3.75">it actually sounds much more
like I&amp;#39;m in a gigantic space</text><text start="2060.13" dur="2.58">with no echo, versus in the actual room.</text><text start="2062.71" dur="2.76">It&amp;#39;s all very subtle,
but very well considered.</text><text start="2065.47" dur="1.2">So once you&amp;#39;re in this a while,</text><text start="2066.67" dur="2.64">you start to notice all
these little smaller things.</text><text start="2069.31" dur="2.19">Again, it&amp;#39;s not quite human-like.</text><text start="2071.5" dur="2.703">It&amp;#39;s not like looking at a
video feed of a human face,</text><text start="2075.07" dur="2.67">but it is still, like
it has a lot of like,</text><text start="2077.74" dur="2.85">this would be the best avatar
anyone&amp;#39;s ever made in 2K.</text><text start="2080.59" dur="1.65">Like no one&amp;#39;s ever done a 2K face scan</text><text start="2082.24" dur="1.41">and had it look this good,</text><text start="2083.65" dur="2.97">but it&amp;#39;s still not as
good as a perfect reality.</text><text start="2086.62" dur="3.15">It&amp;#39;s a, you&amp;#39;ve heard the
uncanny valley thing before.</text><text start="2089.77" dur="2.94">I think the number one
weakness for the avatars</text><text start="2092.71" dur="2.49">or the Personas that I&amp;#39;ve seen is hair.</text><text start="2095.2" dur="1.74">So basically everyone I&amp;#39;ve talked to has</text><text start="2096.94" dur="1.89">like a frozen lump of hair</text><text start="2098.83" dur="2.34">instead of flowing realistic hair.</text><text start="2101.17" dur="1.8">And that&amp;#39;s true about all flowing things,</text><text start="2102.97" dur="2.61">like however your hair
was when you did the scan,</text><text start="2105.58" dur="1.29">it&amp;#39;s frozen that way.</text><text start="2106.87" dur="2.01">And so is any necklace you&amp;#39;re wearing,</text><text start="2108.88" dur="1.74">whether it&amp;#39;s crooked or not,</text><text start="2110.62" dur="3.27">or I guess, technically
also any makeup you had on,</text><text start="2113.89" dur="1.62">or however you looked
when you did the scan.</text><text start="2115.51" dur="1.757">Maybe that could be a good thing.</text><text start="2117.267" dur="1.813">Maybe you did a scan when you
were looking all dolled up,</text><text start="2119.08" dur="1.68">and then you get on a 7:00 AM call,</text><text start="2120.76" dur="1.74">and you still look perfect even though</text><text start="2122.5" dur="1.53">you look like you just
woke up in real life.</text><text start="2124.03" dur="1.95">So I guess there&amp;#39;s that too.</text><text start="2125.98" dur="2.46">But anyway, all that is to say FaceTime.</text><text start="2128.44" dur="4.86">FaceTime is the most well thought out,</text><text start="2133.3" dur="4.62">like most futuristic
Vision Pro experience.</text><text start="2137.92" dur="0.833">It just is.</text><text start="2138.753" dur="1.627">So I&amp;#39;ll end this video with this.</text><text start="2140.38" dur="5">Now you know what it&amp;#39;s
like to use and operate</text><text start="2145.51" dur="1.23">the Vision Pro.</text><text start="2146.74" dur="1.8">But there&amp;#39;s still a lot more to consider</text><text start="2148.54" dur="2.1">when actually considering
if you should buy</text><text start="2150.64" dur="2.88">and own this thing, from the use cases,</text><text start="2153.52" dur="2.7">to the things that work
well, and don&amp;#39;t work well,</text><text start="2156.22" dur="3.36">the philosophy behind it, the
prices, all of that stuff.</text><text start="2159.58" dur="2.7">That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s gonna be for my full review.</text><text start="2162.28" dur="1.23">Like there are parts of this thing</text><text start="2163.51" dur="2.25">that are absolutely amazing,</text><text start="2165.76" dur="2.49">unparalleled, best I&amp;#39;ve ever seen.</text><text start="2168.25" dur="1.56">But the reason it&amp;#39;s so interesting</text><text start="2169.81" dur="2.37">is because it&amp;#39;s actually a young category.</text><text start="2172.18" dur="3.57">Like we&amp;#39;re so used to this
slow, boring iteration</text><text start="2175.75" dur="2.7">in mature categories, like
smartphones, and laptops,</text><text start="2178.45" dur="1.05">and you always see the comments</text><text start="2179.5" dur="2.04">talking about how tech is so boring,</text><text start="2181.54" dur="2.04">but now they&amp;#39;re actually
jumping into something risky,</text><text start="2183.58" dur="3.84">and it&amp;#39;s actually fun, and
there is downfalls and flaws,</text><text start="2187.42" dur="2.49">and it&amp;#39;s fun to actually
weigh the pros and cons.</text><text start="2189.91" dur="1.68">So I&amp;#39;ll be expanding on all these way more</text><text start="2191.59" dur="1.92">in the full review, but
I&amp;#39;ll leave you with this.</text><text start="2193.51" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;ve got my upsides and
downsides to Vision Pro.</text><text start="2197.35" dur="0.96">It&amp;#39;s been a week.</text><text start="2198.31" dur="2.163">Upsides, some of the stuff
that&amp;#39;s the best I&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text><text start="2200.473" dur="1.107">in a headset.</text><text start="2201.58" dur="3.75">Immersion, placement
in space, eye tracking</text><text start="2205.33" dur="4.32">and hand control, passthrough, ecosystem,</text><text start="2209.65" dur="1.77">and spatial audio.</text><text start="2211.42" dur="3.24">And the downsides, weight and comfort,</text><text start="2214.66" dur="1.83">the eyes on the outside,</text><text start="2216.49" dur="4.8">app selection right now,
battery life, and price.</text><text start="2221.29" dur="1.92">So the full reviews in the works.</text><text start="2223.21" dur="2.07">Definitely get subscribed
to be among the first</text><text start="2225.28" dur="1.8">to see that when it drops.</text><text start="2227.08" dur="2.58">Either way, till the next one.</text><text start="2229.66" dur="1.56">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="2231.22" dur="1.29">Catch you later.</text><text start="2232.51" dur="0.833">Peace.</text></transcript>
