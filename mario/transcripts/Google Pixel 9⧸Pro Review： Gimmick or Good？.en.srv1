<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="2.88">- So I really like these new Pixel phones.</text><text start="2.88" dur="1.8">New designs this year, obviously,</text><text start="4.68" dur="2.85">but also new specs, new features,</text><text start="7.53" dur="4.02">also new issues, but of
course, new price tags,</text><text start="11.55" dur="3.09">so we really gotta jump
into the nitty gritty of</text><text start="14.64" dur="2.179">what&amp;#39;s actually good about them.</text><text start="16.819" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text><text start="25.976" dur="3.417">(upbeat music continues)</text><text start="35.037" dur="3.417">(upbeat music continues)</text><text start="44.58" dur="3.24">So we&amp;#39;ve been hoping for a real, complete,</text><text start="47.82" dur="4.02">flagship quality competitor
from Google for a while now.</text><text start="51.84" dur="2.34">And on one hand, it feels
like we finally got &amp;#39;em,</text><text start="54.18" dur="1.5">but on the other hand...</text><text start="55.68" dur="3.36">Did you guys watch the Google
event announcing these things?</text><text start="59.04" dur="1.62">Like, I feel like you
can learn a lot about</text><text start="60.66" dur="1.86">how a company really feels about</text><text start="62.52" dur="2.04">the products that they&amp;#39;re presenting</text><text start="64.56" dur="2.88">by just watching the announcement event,</text><text start="67.44" dur="4.2">and these felt like a software showcase</text><text start="71.64" dur="3.39">that just also happened to
have some phones to go with it.</text><text start="75.03" dur="1.08">Which I guess is not insane</text><text start="76.11" dur="2.1">when you know the history
of Nexus and Pixel,</text><text start="78.21" dur="1.38">but it did the opposite of giving me</text><text start="79.59" dur="1.86">confidence in these phones.</text><text start="81.45" dur="2.49">But now I&amp;#39;ve been using these
phones for two weeks straight,</text><text start="83.94" dur="2.01">and I actually feel like I can tell you</text><text start="85.95" dur="2.046">what&amp;#39;s good or bad about them.</text><text start="87.996" dur="3.114">(upbeat music)</text><text start="91.11" dur="1.77">So, hardware is mostly
what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text><text start="92.88" dur="3.75">when I say these phones feel
like flagships, in a good way.</text><text start="96.63" dur="1.77">Like, it would be easy to dismiss them as</text><text start="98.4" dur="2.4">almost the same as last
year just squared up,</text><text start="100.8" dur="2.4">but there are a lot of
other little things too.</text><text start="103.2" dur="2.82">Like, the screens are brighter
at their max brightness,</text><text start="106.02" dur="3.69">2,700 nits for the Pixel 9
and 3,000 nits for the 9 Pros,</text><text start="109.71" dur="1.89">and then the even bezels
all the way around,</text><text start="111.6" dur="1.77">that requires some extra consideration,</text><text start="113.37" dur="3.21">wrapping the edges of the OLED
panels under those corners.</text><text start="116.58" dur="2.25">And there&amp;#39;s a new ultrasonic
fingerprint reader</text><text start="118.83" dur="3.42">under here on all of them, finally.</text><text start="122.25" dur="1.83">It&amp;#39;s way faster and more reliable</text><text start="124.08" dur="2.31">than the disappointing
optical ones from before.</text><text start="126.39" dur="2.55">The only thing I wish, and
it&amp;#39;s such a small thing,</text><text start="128.94" dur="2.58">but I wish I could just unlock at any time</text><text start="131.52" dur="2.19">when the display is completely off.</text><text start="133.71" dur="2.37">Like, currently, you have to
have the always on display on,</text><text start="136.08" dur="3.06">or hit the power button or
be getting a notification,</text><text start="139.14" dur="2.19">and then you can unlock
with a quick touch.</text><text start="141.33" dur="1.68">But like on Samsung phones,</text><text start="143.01" dur="3.48">that spot on the display is
always a hotspot no matter what,</text><text start="146.49" dur="1.65">you can just unlock by touching there,</text><text start="148.14" dur="1.77">so I kind of wish the Pixel would let me</text><text start="149.91" dur="1.35">do that from a blank screen, too.</text><text start="151.26" dur="1.53">The haptics are really nice again,</text><text start="152.79" dur="2.251">and the buttons are
really clicky this year.</text><text start="155.041" dur="1.739">(buttons clicking)</text><text start="156.78" dur="1.41">But then of course, the hardware</text><text start="158.19" dur="1.59">is what&amp;#39;s on the inside too,</text><text start="159.78" dur="2.37">so that is the new Tensor G4 chip,</text><text start="162.15" dur="2.76">and a bunch of extra RAM.</text><text start="164.91" dur="1.95">Now, the Tensor G4 isn&amp;#39;t actually</text><text start="166.86" dur="2.25">that much more powerful
than last year&amp;#39;s chip,</text><text start="169.11" dur="1.74">in fact, you probably
won&amp;#39;t notice a difference</text><text start="170.85" dur="3.36">for 99% of the stuff you do on the phone,</text><text start="174.21" dur="3.54">but what&amp;#39;s actually
significant is a new NPU</text><text start="177.75" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s way more powerful
and dedicated to AI tasks,</text><text start="181.8" dur="4.5">and the way more RAM is
also dedicated to AI tasks.</text><text start="186.3" dur="1.56">I&amp;#39;m told a big portion of the RAM</text><text start="187.86" dur="1.8">is literally reserved for AI stuff.</text><text start="189.66" dur="2.82">So I will get to all that AI
stuff in a minute, don&amp;#39;t worry.</text><text start="192.48" dur="2.25">But just in the world
that we&amp;#39;re living in,</text><text start="194.73" dur="4.05">where the meta for a lot of
these major new smartphones is,</text><text start="198.78" dur="1.86">okay, minor new
improvements here and there,</text><text start="200.64" dur="3.33">but mainly just a bunch of new
AI features and capabilities,</text><text start="203.97" dur="2.76">I&amp;#39;m glad that the Pixel also got</text><text start="206.73" dur="3.51">a bunch of meaningful
feeling hardware stuff, too.</text><text start="210.24" dur="2.49">And then obviously, yes, you
do have the squared off sides</text><text start="212.73" dur="2.88">that I just know are supposed to fit in</text><text start="215.61" dur="2.28">with the iPhones and
Samsungs of the world.</text><text start="217.89" dur="2.37">I&amp;#39;ve said it before, I
like the look and feel,</text><text start="220.26" dur="2.43">and that also applies to
this new camera visor,</text><text start="222.69" dur="1.8">which is less of a visor</text><text start="224.49" dur="3.33">and I guess more of
like a shelf island now.</text><text start="227.82" dur="2.31">Kind of looks a bit weird in some renders,</text><text start="230.13" dur="1.44">but you just kind of have to trust me,</text><text start="231.57" dur="2.19">seeing it in person, it&amp;#39;s fire.</text><text start="233.76" dur="0.833">I like it.</text><text start="234.593" dur="2.617">Even if it will totally collect
dust in just the same way</text><text start="237.21" dur="2.22">as the last year in
the corners, it&amp;#39;s nice.</text><text start="239.43" dur="1.8">Oh, and I almost forgot,
there is a new size,</text><text start="241.23" dur="4.98">so you can have a Pro phone,
but without it being an XL.</text><text start="246.21" dur="1.05">Love the choice.</text><text start="247.26" dur="1.77">I am a little worried that that one</text><text start="249.03" dur="3.36">probably won&amp;#39;t sell as
well as the two extremes,</text><text start="252.39" dur="2.28">but I&amp;#39;m just, I&amp;#39;m glad we
have the choice this year.</text><text start="254.67" dur="2.67">Be happy about it before
it gets discontinued.</text><text start="257.34" dur="2.1">So anyway, it all sounds pretty good,</text><text start="259.44" dur="2.28">but I do have a few gripes,</text><text start="261.72" dur="2.16">which I&amp;#39;m allowed to, it&amp;#39;s $1,000.</text><text start="263.88" dur="1.86">So, the size of the batteries</text><text start="265.74" dur="2.1">is about the same as last year,</text><text start="267.84" dur="2.49">4,700 milliamp-hours in
the smaller size ones,</text><text start="270.33" dur="2.31">5,000 milliamp-hours in the big phone,</text><text start="272.64" dur="1.89">and I&amp;#39;ve had pretty good battery life,</text><text start="274.53" dur="2.67">like, A minus battery life with the XL.</text><text start="277.2" dur="3.03">Consistently five plus
hours of screen on time,</text><text start="280.23" dur="2.04">lots of heavy, high brightness use.</text><text start="282.27" dur="2.94">But they still don&amp;#39;t charge that fast.</text><text start="285.21" dur="4.23">Like, the XL is maxing
out at like 37 watts,</text><text start="289.44" dur="2.4">and it&amp;#39;s actually slightly
slower on the smaller phones.</text><text start="291.84" dur="3.27">Now, I&amp;#39;m not saying you
gotta go thermonuclear level,</text><text start="295.11" dur="4.11">Realme, 320 watt fast charging,
light your phone on fire</text><text start="299.22" dur="1.53">charging speeds or anything like that,</text><text start="300.75" dur="3.027">I&amp;#39;m just saying fast
charging would be nice.</text><text start="303.777" dur="2.853">50, 60 watts, that&amp;#39;s it.</text><text start="306.63" dur="2.25">I feel like that&amp;#39;s just not that insane</text><text start="308.88" dur="2.64">but would be significantly
better for using the phone.</text><text start="311.52" dur="1.86">Now, I also need to say, Pixel 9</text><text start="313.38" dur="2.22">has matte sides with glossy back,</text><text start="315.6" dur="4.05">but the Pixel 9 Pro has glossy
sides with the matte back.</text><text start="319.65" dur="1.53">We&amp;#39;ve seen this strategy before.</text><text start="321.18" dur="1.44">I just think the matte sides look</text><text start="322.62" dur="2.04">and feel so much better than the glossy,</text><text start="324.66" dur="3.18">so I kind of wish you could
get like a matte on matte look,</text><text start="327.84" dur="1.26">but that&amp;#39;s just me.</text><text start="329.1" dur="1.11">And then one more thing, of course,</text><text start="330.21" dur="1.5">these phones start at higher prices,</text><text start="331.71" dur="2.94">or at least the base one starts at 799,</text><text start="334.65" dur="1.62">but this is a $1,000 phone</text><text start="336.27" dur="2.133">that starts at 128 gigs of storage.</text><text start="339.54" dur="2.31">Thanks, Apple. I guess
that&amp;#39;s the standard now, too.</text><text start="341.85" dur="3.767">But it&amp;#39;s 2024. I would&amp;#39;ve
liked, you know, 256 to start.</text><text start="345.617" dur="2.983">(upbeat music)</text><text start="348.6" dur="1.95">So cameras have always been</text><text start="350.55" dur="2.61">a big part of the Google phone experience,</text><text start="353.16" dur="1.47">or at least they have for a while now,</text><text start="354.63" dur="2.43">and on Pixel 9s, that&amp;#39;s still true,</text><text start="357.06" dur="2.19">but not in exactly the same way.</text><text start="359.25" dur="2.67">So, all across the board,
the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro</text><text start="361.92" dur="2.43">actually share the same primary camera</text><text start="364.35" dur="1.77">and the same ultra wide.</text><text start="366.12" dur="3.81">The Pros just get that extra
telephoto, the 5X zoom.</text><text start="369.93" dur="2.34">And the primary camera that they all share</text><text start="372.27" dur="1.77">is basically the same as last year.</text><text start="374.04" dur="2.91">The ultra wide is new, it&amp;#39;s
48 megapixels instead of 12,</text><text start="376.95" dur="1.23">but it bends down to 12.</text><text start="378.18" dur="3.54">So, look, shooting with these new cameras,</text><text start="381.72" dur="2.64">it&amp;#39;s great, it&amp;#39;s a quick
smartphone camera app,</text><text start="384.36" dur="1.92">there&amp;#39;s a bunch of easy to use modes,</text><text start="386.28" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s responsive, focuses quick, it&amp;#39;s easy</text><text start="389.28" dur="3.3">to get consistent good pictures
that process pretty quickly.</text><text start="392.58" dur="2.82">What I mostly notice about these photos</text><text start="395.4" dur="2.55">is they still look very processed to me.</text><text start="397.95" dur="2.34">Like, this is the Pixel
look now these days,</text><text start="400.29" dur="2.97">with the last few
generations, just lots of HDR,</text><text start="403.26" dur="3.06">lots of contrast, lots of dynamic range.</text><text start="406.32" dur="1.5">Also, lots of sharpening.</text><text start="407.82" dur="2.22">It&amp;#39;s just not as natural of a look</text><text start="410.04" dur="1.17">as we&amp;#39;ve seen in some others.</text><text start="411.21" dur="1.83">It&amp;#39;s just more on the punchy side.</text><text start="413.04" dur="1.98">Which is honestly great
for just sharing a photo</text><text start="415.02" dur="3.72">on social media, but some may
prefer a more neutral photo.</text><text start="418.74" dur="1.8">The new selfie camera on the Pro</text><text start="420.54" dur="1.71">actually feels like
the biggest improvement</text><text start="422.25" dur="3.42">as far as detail and color
over the regular Pixel 9,</text><text start="425.67" dur="2.19">which doesn&amp;#39;t get this, but I&amp;#39;d say</text><text start="427.86" dur="1.8">this is a pretty nice selfie camera,</text><text start="429.66" dur="2.67">just so much dynamic range.</text><text start="432.33" dur="2.25">But if you wanna see and
hear what video footage</text><text start="434.58" dur="2.97">from the Pixel sounds like,
I shot an entire video</text><text start="437.55" dur="3.06">on the auto focus channel
on the Pixel 9 Pro XL</text><text start="440.61" dur="3.3">in 4K30 with, actually,
no external hardware.</text><text start="443.91" dur="2.73">I didn&amp;#39;t even plug in a mic.
This is just the built-in mics.</text><text start="446.64" dur="1.62">So yeah, just me holding a phone.</text><text start="448.26" dur="3.51">If you don&amp;#39;t zoom in at
all, the videos look great.</text><text start="451.77" dur="2.91">They&amp;#39;re sharp, but obviously
still very processed,</text><text start="454.68" dur="3.6">and you can see it, like,
prioritizing segmentation</text><text start="458.28" dur="2.64">and, like, lighting on my face
and shifting colors around.</text><text start="460.92" dur="1.74">So, I&amp;#39;ll leave a link below
if you wanna watch that</text><text start="462.66" dur="1.98">whole eSprinter review when it goes live.</text><text start="464.64" dur="1.41">And you might as well subscribe over there</text><text start="466.05" dur="1.47">while you&amp;#39;re at it for other car videos.</text><text start="467.52" dur="2.67">But this is all part of
the Pixel experience.</text><text start="470.19" dur="2.31">Just like, they&amp;#39;re still
tuning these cameras,</text><text start="472.5" dur="2.79">they may end up looking a little
more natural in the future,</text><text start="475.29" dur="1.98">even though it&amp;#39;s been a generation.</text><text start="477.27" dur="2.7">That&amp;#39;s one of the things that
you can get outta this phone,</text><text start="479.97" dur="1.89">but also, when they present these things,</text><text start="481.86" dur="2.37">it&amp;#39;s all about the features,</text><text start="484.23" dur="3.36">the smarts, the crazy AI magic editor</text><text start="487.59" dur="2.64">and all this AI stuff on these phones.</text><text start="490.23" dur="2.739">There&amp;#39;s a lot to the Pixel experience.</text><text start="492.969" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text><text start="497.07" dur="3.27">So, Google makes Android,</text><text start="500.34" dur="3.27">Google makes their own Android phone,</text><text start="503.61" dur="3.15">therefore the Google
Android phone should be</text><text start="506.76" dur="2.46">the vessel for showing off the latest</text><text start="509.22" dur="2.88">and greatest from Android, right?</text><text start="512.1" dur="3.03">I mean, Android 15 preview
just got shown off in February.</text><text start="515.13" dur="1.92">It&amp;#39;s coming out by the end of the year.</text><text start="517.05" dur="2.943">These phones launch with Android 14.</text><text start="521.01" dur="0.99">That&amp;#39;s not a joke.</text><text start="522" dur="1.5">All these Pixel 9s are running</text><text start="523.5" dur="2.55">the second latest version
of Android out the box.</text><text start="526.05" dur="2.25">Obviously, they should
be first in line for 15,</text><text start="528.3" dur="3.21">and then the seven years of
promised software updates,</text><text start="531.51" dur="1.62">but that&amp;#39;s still hilarious.</text><text start="533.13" dur="2.4">But every time I go back
to using a Pixel, you know,</text><text start="535.53" dur="2.01">I&amp;#39;m reminded of all this stuff</text><text start="537.54" dur="2.13">that I miss when I use other phones.</text><text start="539.67" dur="2.07">Like call screening. So good.</text><text start="541.74" dur="1.693">I mean, I know Samsung kind of has like</text><text start="543.433" dur="2.717">a janky Bixby version of it,
but it doesn&amp;#39;t work as well.</text><text start="546.15" dur="1.23">I&amp;#39;ve tried.</text><text start="547.38" dur="1.59">The now playing feature also.</text><text start="548.97" dur="1.44">that just kind of ambiently tells you</text><text start="550.41" dur="1.56">what song is playing in the background</text><text start="551.97" dur="2.28">wherever you&amp;#39;re at, love it.</text><text start="554.25" dur="3.33">And now there&amp;#39;s all this new
stuff that they&amp;#39;re adding</text><text start="557.58" dur="4.05">that also may or may not
hook people to the Pixel.</text><text start="561.63" dur="2.55">So, Call Notes is a
new one. Pretty useful.</text><text start="564.18" dur="2.88">Summarizes phone call that
you&amp;#39;re on with a recording.</text><text start="567.06" dur="2.52">And the new Pixel Weather app.</text><text start="569.58" dur="3.84">Originally, I wasn&amp;#39;t gonna give
that much of a chance to it,</text><text start="573.42" dur="2.76">but honestly, it&amp;#39;s turned
out to be just as good as</text><text start="576.18" dur="2.16">basically any other Android
weather app I&amp;#39;ve tried.</text><text start="578.34" dur="1.86">So you can get to it by
tapping the weather widget</text><text start="580.2" dur="2.73">on the home screen, and it&amp;#39;s
got this really pretty UI</text><text start="582.93" dur="1.95">where you can rearrange the big tiles</text><text start="584.88" dur="2.97">and put the ones you care
most about closer to the top.</text><text start="587.85" dur="1.83">It doesn&amp;#39;t let you change
your weather source,</text><text start="589.68" dur="2.7">but I mean, I&amp;#39;m already
nitpicking at a level</text><text start="592.38" dur="3.06">that only weather nerds
will really care about.</text><text start="595.44" dur="4.14">And they also threw in an updated
panorama UI in the camera,</text><text start="599.58" dur="2.1">and I don&amp;#39;t know if
anybody cares about this,</text><text start="601.68" dur="4.29">but the temperature sensor in
the Pros works on people now.</text><text start="605.97" dur="1.23">I don&amp;#39;t know if you caught that.</text><text start="607.2" dur="2.46">And it gives these live
temperature readings now</text><text start="609.66" dur="1.86">as you move around an object.</text><text start="611.52" dur="2.04">None of which is medical
advice, by the way.</text><text start="613.56" dur="2.64">I&amp;#39;m actually impressed
by Google&amp;#39;s commitment</text><text start="616.2" dur="2.13">to this particularly useless app.</text><text start="618.33" dur="1.26">Like, Google, I know you get a lot of heat</text><text start="619.59" dur="3.42">for killing things typically,
but I give you permission</text><text start="623.01" dur="2.043">to stop working on the thermometer app.</text><text start="626.038" dur="0.833">I think you&amp;#39;ve done it.</text><text start="626.871" dur="2.079">But there&amp;#39;s one thing that, again,</text><text start="628.95" dur="1.5">if you watched Google&amp;#39;s event,</text><text start="630.45" dur="2.37">that is really supposed
to stand the Pixel out</text><text start="632.82" dur="2.13">from the rest of the world of smartphones,</text><text start="634.95" dur="4.14">and that is because this
is where Gemini lives.</text><text start="639.09" dur="2.88">This is this deep, deep integration</text><text start="641.97" dur="1.68">with Google&amp;#39;s newest assistant here.</text><text start="643.65" dur="3.51">Literally, the boot up
animation on this phone</text><text start="647.16" dur="3.12">is the Google logo, and then it turns into</text><text start="650.28" dur="2.46">the Gemini logo before it starts up.</text><text start="652.74" dur="3.54">Like, these are basically Gemini phones,</text><text start="656.28" dur="2.276">so let&amp;#39;s talk about it.</text><text start="658.556" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text><text start="661.98" dur="2.1">So, ignoring the fact that Google has this</text><text start="664.08" dur="3">horrible habit of rebranding
and renaming things</text><text start="667.08" dur="3.18">in the most confusing way
possible, it seems clear</text><text start="670.26" dur="3.09">that Gemini is the thing we
should be focusing on here.</text><text start="673.35" dur="2.58">Like, there&amp;#39;s a lot of
pressure on this little box</text><text start="675.93" dur="2.19">to be as useful as possible.</text><text start="678.12" dur="2.37">And it actually delivers.</text><text start="680.49" dur="3.6">Like, I have found
Gemini to be very useful,</text><text start="684.09" dur="3.78">and also rapidly improving
over the past couple weeks</text><text start="687.87" dur="2.04">and gaining new capabilities,</text><text start="689.91" dur="1.47">and it&amp;#39;s still, it&amp;#39;s very conversational,</text><text start="691.38" dur="2.34">it remembers context, it gets questions</text><text start="693.72" dur="2.16">correct most of the time.</text><text start="695.88" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s good.</text><text start="696.713" dur="2.137">I clearly need to do an
updated assistant battle,</text><text start="698.85" dur="1.95">because the last one I did was with</text><text start="700.8" dur="2.1">Google Assistant, not Gemini.</text><text start="702.9" dur="2.58">But see, that&amp;#39;s the weird thing.</text><text start="705.48" dur="4.23">Google introduced this
huge, new Gemini assistant</text><text start="709.71" dur="3.96">to everyone, but also, Google Assistant</text><text start="713.67" dur="4.8">still exists alongside
Gemini on these phones, too.</text><text start="718.47" dur="3.24">Like, it&amp;#39;s two different assistants.</text><text start="721.71" dur="1.74">Matter of fact, for a little while,</text><text start="723.45" dur="1.98">Google Assistant was
actually better than Gemini</text><text start="725.43" dur="2.01">at a lot of things for what regular people</text><text start="727.44" dur="3.66">were doing with it, because
Gemini couldn&amp;#39;t set timers,</text><text start="731.1" dur="2.04">it couldn&amp;#39;t get directions to places,</text><text start="733.14" dur="2.4">it couldn&amp;#39;t do basic home controls.</text><text start="735.54" dur="2.37">And so Google Assistant would be the thing</text><text start="737.91" dur="1.11">that it would fall back on</text><text start="739.02" dur="2.22">and that people would continue to use.</text><text start="741.24" dur="0.833">It was confusing.</text><text start="742.073" dur="1.867">Even now, on the Pixel 9,</text><text start="743.94" dur="1.44">you can hold down the power button</text><text start="745.38" dur="2.64">or swipe up from the
corner to get to Gemini,</text><text start="748.02" dur="3.3">but the permanent Pixel home screen widget</text><text start="751.32" dur="3.21">on everyone&amp;#39;s phone, if
you tap that microphone,</text><text start="754.53" dur="2.25">that&amp;#39;s the old Google Assistant.</text><text start="756.78" dur="4.98">But today, now, Gemini can
actually set timers and alarms,</text><text start="761.76" dur="2.16">and it can listen and tell you what song</text><text start="763.92" dur="2.22">is playing in the background,
when it couldn&amp;#39;t before.</text><text start="766.14" dur="3.54">And it can do home controls
like changing my Nest</text><text start="769.68" dur="2.88">thermostat temperature and
turning smart lights on.</text><text start="772.56" dur="2.49">But for some weird reason,</text><text start="775.05" dur="3">when it&amp;#39;s doing all of
these new capabilities,</text><text start="778.05" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s showing me a little
Google Assistant logo</text><text start="781.2" dur="2.16">in the corner, as if to tell me, like,</text><text start="783.36" dur="2.73">okay, it works, and we
have this new capability,</text><text start="786.09" dur="3.84">but Gemini is doing this through
the old Google Assistant,</text><text start="789.93" dur="2.1">which, why even tell me that?</text><text start="792.03" dur="1.38">Just do the thing.</text><text start="793.41" dur="2.88">So anyway, then also, in the settings,</text><text start="796.29" dur="2.52">you&amp;#39;ll be able to have
these Gemini extensions,</text><text start="798.81" dur="1.32">which when you enable them,</text><text start="800.13" dur="2.58">will let Gemini see more
into your actual life,</text><text start="802.71" dur="1.89">like, through other apps like Google Docs</text><text start="804.6" dur="2.37">and Drive and your calendar.</text><text start="806.97" dur="2.97">And to me, that&amp;#39;s really where
it becomes the most useful.</text><text start="809.94" dur="2.73">Like, I start asking it
to find emails for me</text><text start="812.67" dur="1.35">and tell me the traffic to my next</text><text start="814.02" dur="1.98">calendar event and things like that.</text><text start="816" dur="2.4">That is just like talking
to a normal person,</text><text start="818.4" dur="0.99">and it&amp;#39;s super useful.</text><text start="819.39" dur="2.76">But then Gemini Live gets into this</text><text start="822.15" dur="2.76">slightly less comfortable sometimes,</text><text start="824.91" dur="2.28">but also sometimes very useful,</text><text start="827.19" dur="2.07">fully conversational mode with Gemini.</text><text start="829.26" dur="3.48">So you just open it like
this, and let&amp;#39;s full screen.</text><text start="832.74" dur="4.35">So, okay, I&amp;#39;ve got this
wasp nest in my studio,</text><text start="837.09" dur="1.08">and I need to get rid of it.</text><text start="838.17" dur="0.833">What do I do?</text><text start="841.86" dur="1.17">- [Assistant] Wasps are pretty aggressive,</text><text start="843.03" dur="2.64">so getting rid of the nest
safely is the priority.</text><text start="845.67" dur="2.13">Do you know what kind of
wasps are in the nest?</text><text start="847.8" dur="0.93">That will help me figure out</text><text start="848.73" dur="1.98">the best way to help you remove it.</text><text start="850.71" dur="1.56">- I have no idea, but they&amp;#39;re all</text><text start="852.27" dur="1.773">really active all the time.</text><text start="856.41" dur="1.14">- [Assistant] Okay, that makes sense.</text><text start="857.55" dur="2.13">To start, it&amp;#39;s best to try and figure out</text><text start="859.68" dur="1.65">what kind of wasps you&amp;#39;re dealing with.</text><text start="861.33" dur="2.16">Are they yellow and black
with a narrow waist?</text><text start="863.49" dur="2.55">If so, they&amp;#39;re probably yellowjackets.</text><text start="866.04" dur="3.06">Or are they more brown or
gray with a wider waist?</text><text start="869.1" dur="1.02">Those would be paper wasps.</text><text start="870.12" dur="1.59">- You know what, I don&amp;#39;t
wanna get that close to &amp;#39;em.</text><text start="871.71" dur="3.093">How about I just find pest
control nearby? Can you do that?</text><text start="876.39" dur="0.833">- [Assistant] Okay.</text><text start="877.223" dur="3.247">- So this is all at the mercy
of your internet connection</text><text start="880.47" dur="3.96">and it not hallucinating and
getting everything right,</text><text start="884.43" dur="2.79">but when it does, it&amp;#39;s actually,
it can be super useful.</text><text start="887.22" dur="0.833">Especially when you have, like,</text><text start="888.053" dur="2.167">a bunch of follow up
questions about something</text><text start="890.22" dur="2.91">and you wanna just keep
going, then it&amp;#39;s less of</text><text start="893.13" dur="2.4">a bunch of typing Google
and just talking to it.</text><text start="895.53" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="896.363" dur="3.247">So I do think Gemini is actually
really good at this point.</text><text start="899.61" dur="4.71">I will plan on doing a comparison to</text><text start="904.32" dur="2.73">the new Siri, of course, probably ChatGPT,</text><text start="907.05" dur="3.15">and probably some others in
some updated assistant battle.</text><text start="910.2" dur="0.93">Feel free to get subscribed</text><text start="911.13" dur="2.31">if you want to see that when it comes out.</text><text start="913.44" dur="3">But as of right now, yeah,
I&amp;#39;m a fan of what assistant,</text><text start="916.44" dur="2.67">assistant, of what Gemini is doing.</text><text start="919.11" dur="3.06">But the thing is you can do any of this</text><text start="922.17" dur="3.72">with Gemini on any Android phone.</text><text start="925.89" dur="2.04">Matter of fact, Google
literally demoed Gemini</text><text start="927.93" dur="3.9">with a Galaxy S24 Ultra
at their own event.</text><text start="931.83" dur="1.74">Like, they didn&amp;#39;t even try to hide it.</text><text start="933.57" dur="1.62">So if that&amp;#39;s not unique to Pixel</text><text start="935.19" dur="1.62">and it&amp;#39;s basically the Gemini phone, like,</text><text start="936.81" dur="1.83">what&amp;#39;s the point of all this new</text><text start="938.64" dur="2.46">NPU power with the Tensor G4</text><text start="941.1" dur="3.06">and all this extra RAM
dedicated to AI tasks,</text><text start="944.16" dur="2.85">what exactly is that good for?</text><text start="947.01" dur="3.544">Well, there are a bunch of other AI tasks.</text><text start="950.554" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text><text start="954.96" dur="2.04">So here&amp;#39;s how I wanna go through these.</text><text start="957" dur="3.63">There&amp;#39;s a bunch of new AI
features on the Pixel 9s,</text><text start="960.63" dur="3.99">and I wanna just sort of divide them into</text><text start="964.62" dur="4.32">useful, meh, and gimmicks,</text><text start="968.94" dur="1.29">based on my own experience with them</text><text start="970.23" dur="0.87">over the past couple weeks.</text><text start="971.1" dur="1.29">I&amp;#39;ve been trying &amp;#39;em all, using &amp;#39;em,</text><text start="972.39" dur="2.52">putting &amp;#39;em through their
paces, and I have some thoughts.</text><text start="974.91" dur="2.13">So, some of &amp;#39;em are really good</text><text start="977.04" dur="1.5">and add to the Pixel experience,</text><text start="978.54" dur="2.94">and others, not that
great, kind of overrated.</text><text start="981.48" dur="3.48">So, under useful, I&amp;#39;m
putting Gemini, of course,</text><text start="984.96" dur="1.53">just the assistant overall.</text><text start="986.49" dur="2.55">It&amp;#39;s quick, it gets things right. Fine.</text><text start="989.04" dur="4.68">Then I have Call Notes,
Video Boost, and Add Me.</text><text start="993.72" dur="2.4">So, Video Boost actually seems to make</text><text start="996.12" dur="1.83">a surprising difference at how good</text><text start="997.95" dur="2.01">the video quality comes out of a Pixel</text><text start="999.96" dur="2.43">and what you can get outta these.</text><text start="1002.39" dur="2.46">Call Notes is convenient,
because if you have</text><text start="1004.85" dur="1.92">the guts to turn it on on a phone call,</text><text start="1006.77" dur="1.95">it can record everything, ingest it all,</text><text start="1008.72" dur="1.65">transcribe it, summarize it,</text><text start="1010.37" dur="1.53">and give you that after the phone call,</text><text start="1011.9" dur="2.31">which, it&amp;#39;s just useful.</text><text start="1014.21" dur="2.4">And then Add Me. (chuckles) Oh, Add Me.</text><text start="1016.61" dur="1.47">Add Me is interesting.</text><text start="1018.08" dur="3.51">It&amp;#39;s good, it works pretty well,</text><text start="1021.59" dur="3.69">I just, I&amp;#39;m not sure if people
are going to actually use it</text><text start="1025.28" dur="1.53">or if they&amp;#39;re gonna, like, try it once</text><text start="1026.81" dur="2.01">and then forget about it and
go back to taking selfies,</text><text start="1028.82" dur="1.77">but it does what it&amp;#39;s supposed to.</text><text start="1030.59" dur="1.59">It&amp;#39;s right there next
to the portrait mode.</text><text start="1032.18" dur="1.95">It&amp;#39;s easy to access in the camera.</text><text start="1034.13" dur="1.83">And so if you need to take a group shot</text><text start="1035.96" dur="2.52">and you actually have no
one to take it for you,</text><text start="1038.48" dur="2.28">this feature is genuinely useful.</text><text start="1040.76" dur="2.04">It just combines two pictures,</text><text start="1042.8" dur="2.37">and boom, everyone&amp;#39;s now in the photo.</text><text start="1045.17" dur="2.07">In case you were wondering, yes,</text><text start="1047.24" dur="2.85">you can do Add Me with yourself,</text><text start="1050.09" dur="2.4">and yes, if you pixel peep, you can tell</text><text start="1052.49" dur="2.37">that it&amp;#39;s not perfect every single time.</text><text start="1054.86" dur="2.01">There are fuzzy edges.</text><text start="1056.87" dur="2.85">Like, it&amp;#39;s clearly using the
base frame from the first photo</text><text start="1059.72" dur="2.73">and then compositing in the last person.</text><text start="1062.45" dur="1.83">But in general, like, the fact that</text><text start="1064.28" dur="2.52">Google has leaned this far in</text><text start="1066.8" dur="2.46">and created a genuinely
useful feature out of thin air</text><text start="1069.26" dur="3.333">by just abandoning reality
in the Pixel camera app,</text><text start="1073.52" dur="2.13">I guess, yeah, you gotta give &amp;#39;em credit.</text><text start="1075.65" dur="2.34">It&amp;#39;s just will people
actually know to use this</text><text start="1077.99" dur="1.86">or will they just go back
to taking, like, a selfie</text><text start="1079.85" dur="2.28">with everyone behind them so
they get everyone in the shot?</text><text start="1082.13" dur="1.65">I don&amp;#39;t know. Only time will tell.</text><text start="1083.78" dur="4.05">So then there&amp;#39;s meh, there&amp;#39;s,
like, the okay stuff.</text><text start="1087.83" dur="4.23">So, I have the new weather
summaries in the new weather app.</text><text start="1092.06" dur="1.32">They&amp;#39;re AI generated.</text><text start="1093.38" dur="1.2">So right at the top of the app there,</text><text start="1094.58" dur="2.73">it gives you some text to
describe the day for you,</text><text start="1097.31" dur="1.56">so you don&amp;#39;t have to look at all those</text><text start="1098.87" dur="2.52">confusing numbers underneath.</text><text start="1101.39" dur="3.18">Honestly, it&amp;#39;s actually
kind of useful sometimes.</text><text start="1104.57" dur="2.19">But is this really AI?</text><text start="1106.76" dur="3.6">Like, maybe the sentence
structure is coming from an LLM</text><text start="1110.36" dur="2.46">or something, I don&amp;#39;t know, whatever.</text><text start="1112.82" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="1113.653" dur="2.077">It certainly didn&amp;#39;t tell me about all this</text><text start="1115.73" dur="2.4">clouds coming in, probably
gonna dump some rain</text><text start="1118.13" dur="1.74">and also ruin my lighting.</text><text start="1119.87" dur="4.26">But then Magic Editor got
this Reimagine feature</text><text start="1124.13" dur="2.1">that lets you highlight
any part of an image</text><text start="1126.23" dur="1.41">and then enter some text</text><text start="1127.64" dur="2.79">to turn it into something
else completely different</text><text start="1130.43" dur="1.98">to have your photos
look like, I don&amp;#39;t know,</text><text start="1132.41" dur="3.24">a fantasy land or something
that also never happened.</text><text start="1135.65" dur="2.34">It does outright refuse to do</text><text start="1137.99" dur="2.16">some of my more dramatic edits,</text><text start="1140.15" dur="3.21">like, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to
wanna reimagine people ever,</text><text start="1143.36" dur="2.13">but it&amp;#39;ll happily add
objects to the background</text><text start="1145.49" dur="3.45">or change the setting
entirely, if you&amp;#39;re into that.</text><text start="1148.94" dur="1.92">I don&amp;#39;t know. What is a photo anyway?</text><text start="1150.86" dur="3">And then the last meh, but not least,</text><text start="1153.86" dur="4.713">or whatever, is the Screenshots app.</text><text start="1159.56" dur="2.31">Am I missing something here?</text><text start="1161.87" dur="1.77">I mean, I get the premise.</text><text start="1163.64" dur="2.79">You have some screenshots on
your phone that you&amp;#39;ve taken,</text><text start="1166.43" dur="3.57">where you want to save some
critical information in them,</text><text start="1170" dur="2.82">so they built a place where
you can organize &amp;#39;em all</text><text start="1172.82" dur="1.92">into collections, which is convenient.</text><text start="1174.74" dur="1.47">You can search through them.</text><text start="1176.21" dur="2.07">You can have it remind
you at a certain date</text><text start="1178.28" dur="2.31">and time of a specific screenshot,</text><text start="1180.59" dur="3.48">and even link you back to the webpage</text><text start="1184.07" dur="1.83">that you took a screenshot of.</text><text start="1185.9" dur="2.67">And it makes all this
information searchable.</text><text start="1188.57" dur="1.77">But I&amp;#39;m sitting here thinking,</text><text start="1190.34" dur="3.06">shouldn&amp;#39;t this have been
built into Google Photos?</text><text start="1193.4" dur="2.1">Like, did you know that
Samsung&amp;#39;s Photos app</text><text start="1195.5" dur="2.31">already built in the smart linking</text><text start="1197.81" dur="2.01">to any website you take a screenshot of?</text><text start="1199.82" dur="1.74">I mean, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, it works.</text><text start="1201.56" dur="1.62">It does what it&amp;#39;s supposed to.</text><text start="1203.18" dur="4.86">My theory is they&amp;#39;re probably
doing slightly more analysis,</text><text start="1208.04" dur="3.27">more processing of all the bits of text</text><text start="1211.31" dur="2.52">and information in each photo</text><text start="1213.83" dur="2.1">than they would with the
normal Google Photos app,</text><text start="1215.93" dur="3.48">so that is what enables all
the indexing and everything.</text><text start="1219.41" dur="2.28">And then maybe if it goes well,</text><text start="1221.69" dur="4.795">they&amp;#39;ll also bring all that
to the Photos app, maybe?</text><text start="1226.485" dur="1.685">Or if it doesn&amp;#39;t go well,
then they can kill it easily.</text><text start="1228.17" dur="2.58">I don&amp;#39;t know, whatever. It&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="1230.75" dur="3.21">That&amp;#39;s not, though, as bad
as my gimmicks section.</text><text start="1233.96" dur="3.69">So, Zoom Enhance. Have
you heard about this?</text><text start="1237.65" dur="1.74">There&amp;#39;s a new edit
feature finally shipping</text><text start="1239.39" dur="3.66">in the Photos app that encourages
you to zoom all the way in</text><text start="1243.05" dur="3.78">on a photo and then let
it do its Pixel magic,</text><text start="1246.83" dur="1.53">where it plays this whole animation</text><text start="1248.36" dur="1.62">like it&amp;#39;s gonna reconstruct your photo</text><text start="1249.98" dur="4.02">and find some hidden details,
but it kind of never does.</text><text start="1254" dur="1.53">At the end of the day, all it does is</text><text start="1255.53" dur="1.92">sort of turn up the clarity filter</text><text start="1257.45" dur="2.79">and maybe add what feels
like some fake texture</text><text start="1260.24" dur="2.31">where it thinks there

completely on device.</text><text start="1271.25" dur="3.09">And again, what I&amp;#39;m not saying
is that it doesn&amp;#39;t work,</text><text start="1274.34" dur="2.37">it actually does work impressively well.</text><text start="1276.71" dur="2.25">In like three seconds on device,</text><text start="1278.96" dur="1.68">it can generate whatever you want.</text><text start="1280.64" dur="1.26">It&amp;#39;s just that I don&amp;#39;t...</text><text start="1281.9" dur="2.28">I guess I don&amp;#39;t really see

across the board,</text><text start="1309.68" dur="3.15">but then also some splashy new AI features</text><text start="1312.83" dur="2.31">that are only available on the newest one</text><text start="1315.14" dur="2.4">because the new chip
and the new neural cores</text><text start="1317.54" dur="1.8">and it&amp;#39;s just special for that reason.</text><text start="1319.34" dur="1.65">So, that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening.</text><text start="1320.99" dur="1.14">And if you want, you could easily</text><text start="1322.13" dur="2.49">throw these new Pixels into that camp.</text><text start="1324.62" dur="3.27">But the reason you&amp;#39;d buy this phone</text><text start="1327.89" dur="2.49">is really just the same
as ever for a Pixel.</text><text start="1330.38" dur="1.74">It&amp;#39;s the smartest smartphone in the room,</text><text start="1332.12" dur="2.97">and it&amp;#39;s now also in a piece
of kind of nice hardware</text><text start="1335.09" dur="1.95">that&amp;#39;s a pleasure to hold and use.</text><text start="1337.04" dur="2.37">And then there&amp;#39;s a
bunch of AI stuff on top</text><text start="1339.41" dur="3">that you can try and
either take it or leave it.</text><text start="1342.41" dur="1.17">It&amp;#39;s kind of just up to you</text><text start="1343.58" dur="1.65">if you wanna get a bunch
of use outta that stuff</text><text start="1345.23" dur="1.89">or literally never touch it at all.</text><text start="1347.12" dur="1.71">I&amp;#39;m curious if you leave
a comment down below</text><text start="1348.83" dur="2.85">what sort of stuff you think you would use</text><text start="1351.68" dur="2.31">or buy the phone to use, or which stuff</text><text start="1353.99" dur="1.17">you don&amp;#39;t think is that useful at all.</text><text start="1355.16" dur="2.94">At the end of the day, we&amp;#39;ll
have to see how it ages,</text><text start="1358.1" dur="2.73">but I&amp;#39;m thinking Pixel 9 and 9 Pro</text><text start="1360.83" dur="2.43">is some of their finest work yet.</text><text start="1363.26" dur="3.06">Also, shout out to Anker
for sponsoring this video.</text><text start="1366.32" dur="2.64">Their new Anker Prime lineup
is their most advanced</text><text start="1368.96" dur="2.34">multi-device fast
charger they&amp;#39;ve made yet.</text><text start="1371.3" dur="3.69">That includes three charging
stations, one docking station,</text><text start="1374.99" dur="3.9">one wall charger, one power
bank, and one new cable.</text><text start="1378.89" dur="1.44">So the two that stand out to me the most</text><text start="1380.33" dur="2.07">are the Anker Prime charging station</text><text start="1382.4" dur="2.49">and the Anker Prime power bank.</text><text start="1384.89" dur="3.03">The charging station is
this desktop accessory</text><text start="1387.92" dur="3.36">that can kick out 250 watts in total</text><text start="1391.28" dur="2.67">among its four USB C and two USB A ports,</text><text start="1393.95" dur="1.92">and then it has a
display that can show you</text><text start="1395.87" dur="2.4">how much power each port
is drawing actively.</text><text start="1398.27" dur="2.55">And then it lets you
customize charging priority</text><text start="1400.82" dur="2.7">on each port, so you can let
it just sort of auto adjust</text><text start="1403.52" dur="1.59">and make the highest demanding items</text><text start="1405.11" dur="1.83">get the max charge that they can take.</text><text start="1406.94" dur="1.77">And then the power bank</text><text start="1408.71" dur="3.33">has a 9,600 milliamp-hour capacity,</text><text start="1412.04" dur="1.77">and there&amp;#39;s two USB C ports on it,</text><text start="1413.81" dur="2.79">and up to 65 watts output from this thing.</text><text start="1416.6" dur="1.86">But it can also be a wall charger, too.</text><text start="1418.46" dur="2.4">So, that 1.3 inch
display is gonna show you</text><text start="1420.86" dur="1.62">how much battery you have left</text><text start="1422.48" dur="3.24">and how much power each of
those ports is outputting.</text><text start="1425.72" dur="0.84">So you can check &amp;#39;em out,</text><text start="1426.56" dur="1.5">and the rest of the Anker Prime lineup,</text><text start="1428.06" dur="1.5">in the video description.</text><text start="1429.56" dur="2.01">But either way, that&amp;#39;s been it.</text><text start="1431.57" dur="2.79">I got this in before the
pouring rain started,</text><text start="1434.36" dur="0.87">so I&amp;#39;m pretty proud of that.</text><text start="1435.23" dur="2.82">But let me know what you
think in the comments below.</text><text start="1438.05" dur="2.275">Talk to you guys in the next one. Peace.</text><text start="1440.325" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
