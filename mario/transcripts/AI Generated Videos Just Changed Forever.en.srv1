(bright upbeat music)</text><text start="2.233" dur="4.847">- All right, so this is
simultaneously really impressive</text><text start="7.08" dur="3.66">and really frightening at the same time,</text><text start="10.74" dur="1.95">and it&amp;#39;s hitting me in ways
that I didn&amp;#39;t really expect.</text><text start="12.69" dur="2.49">So do you remember Will
Smith eating spaghetti?</text><text start="15.18" dur="1.14">Do you remember when this</text><text start="16.32" dur="2.07">was what AI generated videos looked like?</text><text start="18.39" dur="2.557">Remember when we said, &amp;quot;Okay,
this AI stuff is cool and all</text><text start="20.947" dur="2.04">&amp;quot;but clearly there&amp;#39;s a long way to go</text><text start="22.987" dur="2.633">&amp;quot;before there&amp;#39;s any need for concern.&amp;quot;</text><text start="25.62" dur="1.89">Well, welcome to the future people</text><text start="27.51" dur="4.59">because this is also
an AI generated video.</text><text start="32.1" dur="3.03">And so is this, completely
synthesized out of thin air</text><text start="35.13" dur="1.32">by computers.</text><text start="36.45" dur="2.88">This one too, this is not real.</text><text start="39.33" dur="1.23">Absolutely ridiculous</text><text start="40.56" dur="2.82">how far we&amp;#39;ve come in literally one year.</text><text start="43.38" dur="5">This does feel like another
ChatGPT, DALL.E moment for AI.</text><text start="49.41" dur="1.14">And maybe I&amp;#39;m overreacting</text><text start="50.55" dur="2.76">because, okay, I am a video creator,</text><text start="53.31" dur="3.15">so an AI that&amp;#39;s actually doing my job,</text><text start="56.46" dur="1.59">maybe that feels a little more threatening</text><text start="58.05" dur="1.53">so I&amp;#39;m particularly impressed by it.</text><text start="59.58" dur="2.73">But also this stuff is really good.</text><text start="62.31" dur="3.96">So today, Sam Altman and
OpenAI announced a new model</text><text start="66.27" dur="2.25">called Sora and it can generate</text><text start="68.52" dur="4.62">full up to one minute video
clips from just text input.</text><text start="73.14" dur="4.2">So the same way DALL.E was able
to understand our text input</text><text start="77.34" dur="2.34">and turn it into a photorealistic</text><text start="79.68" dur="2.37">or stylized image or whatever you want,</text><text start="82.05" dur="3.72">same thing with Sora but
now since it&amp;#39;s videos,</text><text start="85.77" dur="2.34">it also needs to understand</text><text start="88.11" dur="3.24">how all these things like
reflections and textures</text><text start="91.35" dur="3.9">and materials and physics
all interact with each other</text><text start="95.25" dur="2.52">over time to make a
reasonable looking video.</text><text start="97.77" dur="2.1">And of course, right away,
there&amp;#39;s a bunch of examples</text><text start="99.87" dur="1.32">on their website that are crazy.</text><text start="101.19" dur="1.17">Now, before I show you these,</text><text start="102.36" dur="1.65">I just need you to keep this in mind,</text><text start="104.01" dur="3.36">you&amp;#39;re about to watch a
bunch of AI generated videos</text><text start="107.37" dur="2.58">and you know that you&amp;#39;re about to watch</text><text start="109.95" dur="1.41">a bunch of AI generated content.</text><text start="111.36" dur="2.58">So your brain, you&amp;#39;re already
looking for this stuff</text><text start="113.94" dur="3.18">and it&amp;#39;s not perfect, you
will find imperfections,</text><text start="117.12" dur="3.54">but not everybody who
sees AI generated content</text><text start="120.66" dur="3.42">on the internet knows
to be looking for that.</text><text start="124.08" dur="2.19">So also keep that in mind.</text><text start="126.27" dur="2.22">This is also the worst
that this technology</text><text start="128.49" dur="1.98">is going to be from here on out.</text><text start="130.47" dur="1.59">So, okay, here&amp;#39;s one of the videos.</text><text start="132.06" dur="1.68">There&amp;#39;s no audio to any of these clips,</text><text start="133.74" dur="1.5">but the prompt for this one</text><text start="135.24" dur="3.39">is a stylish woman walks
down a Tokyo street</text><text start="138.63" dur="3.48">filled with warm, glowing,
neon and animated city signage.</text><text start="142.11" dur="1.8">She wears a black leather jacket,</text><text start="143.91" dur="2.91">a long red dress and black boots.</text><text start="146.82" dur="4.14">This video is already miles
ahead of where we were.</text><text start="150.96" dur="2.82">It has accurate lighting,
it has materials,</text><text start="153.78" dur="2.4">it has skin tones, movements,</text><text start="156.18" dur="2.58">even has reflections all over the place.</text><text start="158.76" dur="1.23">Now, of course, if you look at it</text><text start="159.99" dur="2.49">for more than about 10
seconds, very closely,</text><text start="162.48" dur="1.38">there are lots of giveaways.</text><text start="163.86" dur="1.26">Like this dude in the background</text><text start="165.12" dur="3.21">kinda looks like he&amp;#39;s
gliding in a weird way.</text><text start="168.33" dur="1.8">The frame rates and the
reflections in the water</text><text start="170.13" dur="2.61">are for some reason lower
than the rest of the video.</text><text start="172.74" dur="2.16">The camera movement overall
is just a bit inconsistent</text><text start="174.9" dur="1.2">and it just, I don&amp;#39;t know,</text><text start="176.1" dur="2.7">it just kinda feels a little bit off.</text><text start="178.8" dur="3.87">But then again, this is
where we were one year ago.</text><text start="182.67" dur="2.94">So just keep that in the back
of your head for all this.</text><text start="185.61" dur="0.833">Okay, how about this one?</text><text start="186.443" dur="2.497">This is another one
which has a long prompt</text><text start="188.94" dur="3.39">about a camera following
behind a white vintage SUV</text><text start="192.33" dur="4.32">with a black roof rack as it&amp;#39;s
speeds up a steep dirt road.</text><text start="196.65" dur="3.48">This is also, again, really good.</text><text start="200.13" dur="1.77">It kinda looks a little more video gamey</text><text start="201.9" dur="2.85">because of how rock solid
the drone footage is,</text><text start="204.75" dur="2.4">but clearly very usable.</text><text start="207.15" dur="0.93">Here&amp;#39;s another one,</text><text start="208.08" dur="3.27">a litter of golden retriever
puppies playing in the snow.</text><text start="211.35" dur="3.15">Their heads pop in and out
of the snow covered in it,</text><text start="214.5" dur="0.833">it&amp;#39;s so good.</text><text start="215.333" dur="2.467">It feels like the physics
of the fur and the ears</text><text start="217.8" dur="3.63">and everything with the snow
flying around in slow motion</text><text start="221.43" dur="0.833">is incredible.</text><text start="222.263" dur="1.537">I&amp;#39;ve looked through all
of the sample videos</text><text start="223.8" dur="1.26">on OpenAI&amp;#39;s website,</text><text start="225.06" dur="2.94">and clearly these are
the handpicked best ones</text><text start="228" dur="1.17">that they chose to share</text><text start="229.17" dur="1.5">where they just put in some text</text><text start="230.67" dur="2.25">and then get a video and don&amp;#39;t modify it.</text><text start="232.92" dur="1.32">But there&amp;#39;s really
impressive stuff in there.</text><text start="234.24" dur="1.83">Some of it has humans, some of it doesn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="236.07" dur="2.22">Some of it is more realistic feeling</text><text start="238.29" dur="1.17">like the truck driving one,</text><text start="239.46" dur="3.39">but some of them are more
video gamey or more stylized.</text><text start="242.85" dur="1.14">A lot of it is slow motion,</text><text start="243.99" dur="2.64">I just have to say how insanely fast</text><text start="246.63" dur="3.36">these models are improving is genuinely,</text><text start="249.99" dur="1.35">like that&amp;#39;s the shocking part.</text><text start="251.34" dur="3.66">Like I remember not even that
many months ago, DALL-E 3,</text><text start="255" dur="1.68">really, really high end,</text><text start="256.68" dur="2.76">and you could always still
find something off about it.</text><text start="259.44" dur="1.26">Like especially if you ask it</text><text start="260.7" dur="4.65">for something like a
photorealistic image of a human,</text><text start="265.35" dur="2.97">something about like the hands or the ears</text><text start="268.32" dur="2.13">would always just be a little bit off,</text><text start="270.45" dur="1.02">nevermind the physics.</text><text start="271.47" dur="4.56">But even this video here
is crazy at first glance.</text><text start="276.03" dur="1.77">The prompt for this AI generated video</text><text start="277.8" dur="1.92">is a young man in his 20s</text><text start="279.72" dur="3.66">is sitting on a piece of a
cloud in the sky reading a book.</text><text start="283.38" dur="4.56">This one feels like 90%
of the way there for me.</text><text start="287.94" dur="1.89">Like it&amp;#39;s beyond the uncanny valley</text><text start="289.83" dur="1.47">of like apple&amp;#39;s personas,</text><text start="291.3" dur="2.04">which are actually based on humans.</text><text start="293.34" dur="1.59">This is a made up person.</text><text start="294.93" dur="1.38">I mean, his eyes are kinda weird,</text><text start="296.31" dur="3.18">and the motion of the pages
in the book are kinda odd.</text><text start="299.49" dur="1.912">And yeah, obviously, he&amp;#39;s in
a cloud and that&amp;#39;s a giveaway</text><text start="301.402" dur="4.058">but like, the lighting and
the shadows and the skin tones</text><text start="305.46" dur="2.13">and then all the realism of
the textures on the shirt</text><text start="307.59" dur="2.34">and the way the shirt and
the pants move and the hair,</text><text start="309.93" dur="1.86">they&amp;#39;re all really impressive.</text><text start="311.79" dur="0.99">And then for this one,</text><text start="312.78" dur="2.31">they typed in a movie trailer</text><text start="315.09" dur="3.99">featuring the adventurers
of the 30-year old spaceman</text><text start="319.08" dur="4.11">wearing a red wool knitted
motorcycle helmet, blue sky,</text><text start="323.19" dur="5">salt desert, cinematic style,
shot on 35 millimeter film.</text><text start="328.47" dur="4.62">And the closeups of his face,
the fabrics on the helmet,</text><text start="333.09" dur="3.3">the film grain through every
shot and the cinematic style,</text><text start="336.39" dur="3.87">this is one of the most
convincing AI generated videos</text><text start="340.26" dur="2.73">I&amp;#39;ve ever seen, minus
maybe the weird physics</text><text start="342.99" dur="2.25">of that dude walking
kind of in fast motion.</text><text start="345.24" dur="1.59">So Sam Altman, if you
follow him on Twitter,</text><text start="346.83" dur="1.08">he&amp;#39;s going through a whole bunch more</text><text start="347.91" dur="1.83">of like people&amp;#39;s requests</text><text start="349.74" dur="2.1">and posting a bunch more generated videos.</text><text start="351.84" dur="1.23">And so if you wanna check out his profile,</text><text start="353.07" dur="0.833">you can see those.</text><text start="353.903" dur="4.627">But here&amp;#39;s the thing about
these AI generated videos now,</text><text start="358.53" dur="2">as good as they&amp;#39;ve gotten to this point,</text><text start="361.38" dur="5">they can and will pass as real videos</text><text start="366.51" dur="3.39">to people who are not looking
for AI generated videos.</text><text start="369.9" dur="3.24">Now that is obviously insanely sketchy</text><text start="373.14" dur="1.74">during an election year in the U.S.</text><text start="374.88" dur="0.9">and also terrifying</text><text start="375.78" dur="2.07">for a bunch of other
internet related reasons</text><text start="377.85" dur="4.44">but it&amp;#39;s also perfect for stock footage.</text><text start="382.29" dur="3.39">Like there are already
all kinds of presentations</text><text start="385.68" dur="2.76">and advertisements and then PowerPoints</text><text start="388.44" dur="4.65">that are in need of oddly
specific stock videos.</text><text start="393.09" dur="4.95">And these AI generated videos
are already good enough</text><text start="398.04" dur="2.79">to 100% pass for that purpose.</text><text start="400.83" dur="2.1">Like look at this one,
this one with the waves</text><text start="402.93" dur="2.49">at Big Sur, this drone shot.</text><text start="405.42" dur="2.4">Honestly, if I saw this on Twitter,</text><text start="407.82" dur="1.11">I wouldn&amp;#39;t even think twice.</text><text start="408.93" dur="1.86">I&amp;#39;d be like, &amp;quot;Oh, nice drone shot, dude.&amp;quot;</text><text start="410.79" dur="2.88">Wouldn&amp;#39;t even think about
AI if I wasn&amp;#39;t pixel peeping</text><text start="413.67" dur="1.89">at like the way the water was moving.</text><text start="415.56" dur="3.45">Like this is a totally
usable video in an ad</text><text start="419.01" dur="2.07">for some California based product.</text><text start="421.08" dur="4.02">And that has all sorts of
implications for the drone pilot</text><text start="425.1" dur="2.1">that no longer needs to be hired,</text><text start="427.2" dur="2.43">for all the photographers
and videographers</text><text start="429.63" dur="2.94">whose footage no longer
needs to be licensed</text><text start="432.57" dur="2.4">to show up in that ad that&amp;#39;s being made.</text><text start="434.97" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s already that good.</text><text start="436.65" dur="2.4">There&amp;#39;s other stuff like this wall of TVs,</text><text start="439.05" dur="2.79">which would be a totally
expensive and difficult thing</text><text start="441.84" dur="3.48">to shoot with a camera and
all these old expensive props,</text><text start="445.32" dur="4.2">but if you can just generate
it this well with reflections</text><text start="449.52" dur="2.61">and the environment and
everything else around it,</text><text start="452.13" dur="1.83">I mean, why do it any other way?</text><text start="453.96" dur="2.94">It&amp;#39;s also very capable of
historical themed footage.</text><text start="456.9" dur="4.05">So this is supposed to be
California during the Gold Rush.</text><text start="460.95" dur="2.4">It&amp;#39;s AI generated but
it could totally pass</text><text start="463.35" dur="1.83">for the opening scene in an old Western</text><text start="465.18" dur="1.35">with the right music over it.</text><text start="466.53" dur="1.35">How long until an entire ad,</text><text start="467.88" dur="3.21">every single shot is
completely generated with AI?</text><text start="471.09" dur="3.42">Or what about an entire YouTube
video or an entire movie?</text><text start="474.51" dur="1.896">I&amp;#39;m tempted to say like we&amp;#39;re
a long way away from that</text><text start="476.406" dur="2.994">because you know, this
still has flaws clearly</text><text start="479.4" dur="0.91">and there&amp;#39;s no sound,</text><text start="480.31" dur="2.51">and there&amp;#39;s a long way to go
with the prompt engineering</text><text start="482.82" dur="2.13">to iron these things out.</text><text start="484.95" dur="4.26">But then again, the spaghetti
was like a year ago.</text><text start="489.21" dur="2.22">Now actually like that
OpenAI, on their website,</text><text start="491.43" dur="2.07">they show some of the downfalls too</text><text start="493.5" dur="1.92">of this particular model.</text><text start="495.42" dur="1.2">And because who would know better</text><text start="496.62" dur="1.44">than the people who have been using it?</text><text start="498.06" dur="2.16">This is a very private
tool, by the way, right now.</text><text start="500.22" dur="1.38">It&amp;#39;s in super limited access,</text><text start="501.6" dur="1.907">so it&amp;#39;s in the hands of red teamers,</text><text start="503.507" dur="3.463">which basically means people
testing it, pushing the limits,</text><text start="506.97" dur="2.796">trying to break it, and
a few trusted creators.</text><text start="509.766" dur="3.894">But they have found plenty
of weird edge stuff.</text><text start="513.66" dur="3.27">Like this clip here of a
bunch of gray wolf pups</text><text start="516.93" dur="0.93">looks normal at first</text><text start="517.86" dur="1.95">but then it&amp;#39;s pretty clear
that something&amp;#39;s kinda off</text><text start="519.81" dur="2.67">with the way they&amp;#39;re just
kinda appearing out of nowhere</text><text start="522.48" dur="1.86">and walking through each other.</text><text start="524.34" dur="1.14">That&amp;#39;s kinda weird.</text><text start="525.48" dur="2.31">Or this clip of a guy
running on a treadmill,</text><text start="527.79" dur="1.92">which I mean, I don&amp;#39;t
really have to say much more</text><text start="529.71" dur="1.2">about why this one is weird.</text><text start="530.91" dur="1.26">But this is my favorite one, again,</text><text start="532.17" dur="2.73">so again, just try to put
yourself in the mind of someone</text><text start="534.9" dur="1.71">who&amp;#39;s not expecting AI.</text><text start="536.61" dur="3">You&amp;#39;re just scrolling through Facebook</text><text start="539.61" dur="1.86">or Twitter or something, right?</text><text start="541.47" dur="0.9">So you just see this video.</text><text start="542.37" dur="1.38">So first I just want
you to watch this clip</text><text start="543.75" dur="1.92">as if it&amp;#39;s just a stock video you found</text><text start="545.67" dur="2.01">of a grandma celebrating her birthday.</text><text start="547.68" dur="1.65">And just try to think like,</text><text start="549.33" dur="2.16">I wonder what birthday
she&amp;#39;s celebrating, right?</text><text start="551.49" dur="1.14">I don&amp;#39;t know, how old do you think she is?</text><text start="552.63" dur="1.02">60?</text><text start="553.65" dur="0.833">65?</text><text start="554.483" dur="1.237">Maybe it&amp;#39;s the big 70.</text><text start="555.72" dur="1.62">She seems to really like that cake.</text><text start="557.34" dur="2.31">Now, did you see it?</text><text start="559.65" dur="1.241">Did you catch that?</text><text start="560.891" dur="1.249">I&amp;#39;m gonna play it again,</text><text start="562.14" dur="2.13">but this time, watch the video</text><text start="564.27" dur="3.42">knowing that AI generated
photos and videos</text><text start="567.69" dur="4.86">have trouble accurately doing hands.</text><text start="572.55" dur="0.833">I&amp;#39;ll play it again.</text><text start="573.383" dur="4.087">And now it feels super obvious
like every time you watch it,</text><text start="577.47" dur="2.94">watch a different set of hands,
it gets weirder and weirder.</text><text start="580.41" dur="2.37">You can watch it like five
times and there&amp;#39;s dead giveaway</text><text start="582.78" dur="1.17">after dead giveaway,</text><text start="583.95" dur="1.8">not even mentioning the
weird inconsistencies</text><text start="585.75" dur="3.09">with the direction of
the wind on the candles.</text><text start="588.84" dur="1.53">But even as I&amp;#39;m saying all that,</text><text start="590.37" dur="1.44">even as it&amp;#39;s coming outta my mouth,</text><text start="591.81" dur="2.85">I can&amp;#39;t help but remember
that 12 months ago</text><text start="594.66" dur="1.992">we were critiquing this.</text><text start="596.652" dur="1.608">(Will laughing)</text><text start="598.26" dur="2.1">So what does this all mean?</text><text start="600.36" dur="2.34">Well, I mean, there&amp;#39;s what it means now</text><text start="602.7" dur="2.31">and there&amp;#39;s what it means for the future.</text><text start="605.01" dur="3.18">Now, Sora, this thing that they&amp;#39;ve made</text><text start="608.19" dur="4.41">is clearly a really impressive
video generation AI tool</text><text start="612.6" dur="5">that is both going to fool
people and also be very useful.</text><text start="618.082" dur="3.068">There&amp;#39;s also a watermark
in the bottom corner</text><text start="621.15" dur="1.41">of every video generated by it.</text><text start="622.56" dur="1.23">So if you see one of those videos</text><text start="623.79" dur="2.28">and ideally it hasn&amp;#39;t been cropped out,</text><text start="626.07" dur="1.83">then that&amp;#39;s at least a
pretty clear indicator</text><text start="627.9" dur="1.05">that it&amp;#39;s AI generated.</text><text start="628.95" dur="0.93">It&amp;#39;s a Sora video.</text><text start="629.88" dur="3.54">But also, I do think they&amp;#39;re
