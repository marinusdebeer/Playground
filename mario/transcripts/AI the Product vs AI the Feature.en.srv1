- Okay, so I was listening</text><text start="3.84" dur="2.07">to the Wired podcast this morning</text><text start="5.91" dur="1.32">and they said something</text><text start="7.23" dur="2.55">that really nailed the way I think about</text><text start="9.78" dur="3">a lot of emerging
technologies, especially AI.</text><text start="12.78" dur="4.05">What they said was WWDC,
which we just had from Apple,</text><text start="16.83" dur="5">basically proved that AI is
a feature, not a product,</text><text start="24.51" dur="2.97">and this hit so hard for me,</text><text start="27.48" dur="2.19">because that&amp;#39;s the exact question</text><text start="29.67" dur="2.88">that we&amp;#39;ve been asking
ourselves for so long here</text><text start="32.55" dur="1.08">about new stuff.</text><text start="33.63" dur="2.97">Is it a feature or a product?</text><text start="36.6" dur="1.56">So, I&amp;#39;ll give you an example.</text><text start="38.16" dur="2.73">Do you remember Clubhouse?</text><text start="40.89" dur="0.93">We&amp;#39;ve talked about this before,</text><text start="41.82" dur="2.55">but Clubhouse back in the 2020s,</text><text start="44.37" dur="1.41">like, the pandemic era,</text><text start="45.78" dur="2.46">it was this meteoric rise to success.</text><text start="48.24" dur="0.93">There was this platform</text><text start="49.17" dur="3.57">that was just live audio stage events</text><text start="52.74" dur="2.01">that would disappear after they were over,</text><text start="54.75" dur="1.05">and that&amp;#39;s kind of all it was.</text><text start="55.8" dur="2.16">It was super simple, but with
everybody sitting at home,</text><text start="57.96" dur="1.47">it blew up in popularity.</text><text start="59.43" dur="1.98">It skyrockets to the top of the App Store.</text><text start="61.41" dur="1.44">Everyone starts using it.</text><text start="62.85" dur="2.61">It had major interviews happen on it.</text><text start="65.46" dur="2.34">Major new weekly shows were created on it.</text><text start="67.8" dur="1.17">There were huge famous people</text><text start="68.97" dur="2.22">participating in Clubhouses regularly.</text><text start="71.19" dur="4.23">But fast forward literally
one year, maybe two,</text><text start="75.42" dur="4.26">and suddenly Spotify had built
this feature into their app,</text><text start="79.68" dur="1.71">Discord had built the
feature into their app.</text><text start="81.39" dur="1.353">They built Stages.</text><text start="83.58" dur="2.22">Slack had built it into their app.</text><text start="85.8" dur="1.62">Even Twitter had built it into their app.</text><text start="87.42" dur="1.77">They&amp;#39;ve got Spaces now.</text><text start="89.19" dur="3.03">And so suddenly, it was just a feature</text><text start="92.22" dur="2.04">inside of these larger apps.</text><text start="94.26" dur="2.55">So, the question became is Clubhouse,</text><text start="96.81" dur="1.71">this huge thing that came outta nowhere,</text><text start="98.52" dur="4.53">is this a product or is it just a feature,</text><text start="103.05" dur="2.82">and it turned out the success
of all of the features</text><text start="105.87" dur="1.26">and all the other apps that built it in</text><text start="107.13" dur="2.31">meant that Clubhouse would just die,</text><text start="109.44" dur="2.04">like, and a lot of the other
ones eventually ended up dying.</text><text start="111.48" dur="1.38">I think we still have Twitter Spaces,</text><text start="112.86" dur="2.58">but generally it just became a feature.</text><text start="115.44" dur="1.56">And there are actually
many examples of these,</text><text start="117" dur="2.16">which is why the product
versus feature question</text><text start="119.16" dur="1.77">still keeps coming up over and over again.</text><text start="120.93" dur="1.95">So now, the newest question.</text><text start="122.88" dur="4.5">Is AI a product or a feature,</text><text start="127.38" dur="2.01">because we got to see what it looked like</text><text start="129.39" dur="1.56">as a standalone product.</text><text start="130.95" dur="3.12">Like, we just had in 2024,
we had the Humane AI Pin,</text><text start="134.07" dur="1.74">which was a dedicated piece of hardware</text><text start="135.81" dur="2.55">specifically for engaging with an AI.</text><text start="138.36" dur="1.29">We got the Rabbit r1,</text><text start="139.65" dur="2.01">another device that promised to be, like,</text><text start="141.66" dur="2.19">this physical embodiment of an assistant</text><text start="143.85" dur="0.833">you have everywhere.</text><text start="144.683" dur="2.287">Now, both these devices were bad</text><text start="146.97" dur="0.93">and they didn&amp;#39;t work very well,</text><text start="147.9" dur="0.84">but let&amp;#39;s say they did.</text><text start="148.74" dur="2.07">Let&amp;#39;s say they actually
worked well and were fine.</text><text start="150.81" dur="2.79">That would be AI as a product,</text><text start="153.6" dur="1.05">and you could even consider, like,</text><text start="154.65" dur="3.78">going to the ChatGPT
website and using it there</text><text start="158.43" dur="1.32">as AI as a product.</text><text start="159.75" dur="2.79">But then fast forward now
to just a few months later</text><text start="162.54" dur="2.28">and we just had Apple&amp;#39;s WWDC,</text><text start="164.82" dur="2.34">and we also just had Google I/O,</text><text start="167.16" dur="1.83">and very different approach.</text><text start="168.99" dur="1.23">Like, look what happened with Apple.</text><text start="170.22" dur="2.13">Just like clockwork, they went through</text><text start="172.35" dur="3.66">and systematically added
all these AI features</text><text start="176.01" dur="3.12">sprinkled throughout a bunch
of its operating systems.</text><text start="179.13" dur="1.65">So, for example, inside of any app</text><text start="180.78" dur="1.68">with the ability to write text,</text><text start="182.46" dur="2.31">you now have these
writing tools that pop up</text><text start="184.77" dur="2.43">that are powered by
these new language models</text><text start="187.2" dur="2.58">that can help you summarize, or proofread,</text><text start="189.78" dur="2.34">or change the tone or
style of your writing,</text><text start="192.12" dur="1.47">and then there&amp;#39;s also
a new Siri, you know,</text><text start="193.59" dur="1.98">powered by these language models again,</text><text start="195.57" dur="1.74">so it can hold conversations better</text><text start="197.31" dur="1.59">and understand context better</text><text start="198.9" dur="2.46">and use a semantic index to parse info</text><text start="201.36" dur="2.4">about various files and
things on your device</text><text start="203.76" dur="2.01">and bring them into Siri&amp;#39;s understanding.</text><text start="205.77" dur="1.56">You can literally generate images</text><text start="207.33" dur="1.47">as a feature on your device.</text><text start="208.8" dur="1.83">You can generate emojis.</text><text start="210.63" dur="0.833">The list goes on,</text><text start="211.463" dur="2.707">but the point is it&amp;#39;s
clearly a very different way</text><text start="214.17" dur="2.91">of thinking about AI for the consumer,</text><text start="217.08" dur="2.13">where it&amp;#39;s just one of the features</text><text start="219.21" dur="2.31">built into the thing that you use.</text><text start="221.52" dur="2.1">Now, I realize this
isn&amp;#39;t a perfect analogy.</text><text start="223.62" dur="2.49">I think probably the biggest flaw</text><text start="226.11" dur="3.48">being that, you know, when
they integrated these features,</text><text start="229.59" dur="3.48">like when Slack, when
Twitter built Spaces,</text><text start="233.07" dur="1.26">when they built these features,</text><text start="234.33" dur="4.11">they didn&amp;#39;t integrate Clubhouse
into those bigger websites.</text><text start="238.44" dur="3.93">They actually just took the
idea of what Clubhouse is,</text><text start="242.37" dur="3.24">which is just a live audio event on stage</text><text start="245.61" dur="2.49">and they built it themselves
into their own apps,</text><text start="248.1" dur="1.89">so Clubhouse was left to die.</text><text start="249.99" dur="2.04">But in this specific case with Apple,</text><text start="252.03" dur="1.8">it&amp;#39;s actually a combination of two things.</text><text start="253.83" dur="2.52">It&amp;#39;s them building a
bunch of their own models</text><text start="256.35" dur="1.68">to do a lot of these things on device,</text><text start="258.03" dur="4.53">but then also them literally
building a ChatGPT wrapper</text><text start="262.56" dur="1.74">into a lot of their OS,</text><text start="264.3" dur="3.9">so ChatGPT actually gets
more users this way.</text><text start="268.2" dur="1.44">So, I thought this was fun to think about.</text><text start="269.64" dur="1.62">Now, there is no answer yet</text><text start="271.26" dur="4.02">as far as is AI actually
a feature or a product?</text><text start="275.28" dur="2.34">Which one will win? Which
one will lose? We don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="277.62" dur="2.67">But I think if history is any indication,</text><text start="280.29" dur="3.21">I do think that more
people in the long run</text><text start="283.5" dur="4.47">are going to end up using
this AI stuff as a feature</text><text start="287.97" dur="2.55">more than going to,
like, a standalone thing.</text><text start="290.52" dur="2.16">Like, I was looking back
for other examples of this,</text><text start="292.68" dur="2.73">and I honestly found it really
hard to find any examples</text><text start="295.41" dur="2.16">of the other way around happening,</text><text start="297.57" dur="4.23">where the individual product
becomes far more successful</text><text start="301.8" dur="3.27">than the same idea
being baked as a feature</text><text start="305.07" dur="1.14">into something larger.</text><text start="306.21" dur="2.28">Like, I think TikTok is
maybe the best example</text><text start="308.49" dur="2.04">of this opposite version,</text><text start="310.53" dur="3.66">where TikTok is, it&amp;#39;s a
vertical video carousel</text><text start="314.19" dur="2.22">with an algorithm that
learns really quickly</text><text start="316.41" dur="1.77">what video you wanna see next, right?</text><text start="318.18" dur="2.13">That&amp;#39;s what TikTok is.</text><text start="320.31" dur="1.53">Like, we&amp;#39;ve seen Instagram Reels</text><text start="321.84" dur="1.92">develop that exact same thing.</text><text start="323.76" dur="2.01">Now it&amp;#39;s a huge feature for them.</text><text start="325.77" dur="1.17">Same thing with YouTube Shorts.</text><text start="326.94" dur="2.52">We&amp;#39;ve got all of YouTube,
but inside of YouTube</text><text start="329.46" dur="3.12">is this vertically-scrolling
carousel with an algorithm.</text><text start="332.58" dur="1.71">But I still think today,
we would say TikTok</text><text start="334.29" dur="2.67">is the most popular version of that idea,</text><text start="336.96" dur="3.45">so the standalone version
is winning currently</text><text start="340.41" dur="1.83">over it being built in as a feature.</text><text start="342.24" dur="2.04">And maybe Snapchat is another one, kinda?</text><text start="344.28" dur="1.26">Like, Snapchat stories</text><text start="345.54" dur="1.62">was one of the biggest
features in Snapchat,</text><text start="347.16" dur="1.53">and then that kinda got ripped</text><text start="348.69" dur="1.83">into being a feature everywhere else.</text><text start="350.52" dur="1.32">Like, everyone has stories,</text><text start="351.84" dur="3.75">but Snapchat by itself is doing well.</text><text start="355.59" dur="2.61">But anyway, the question is
do you have to get all the way</text><text start="358.2" dur="3.18">to the level of Snapchat or TikTok</text><text start="361.38" dur="2.64">in order to be successful
as a standalone product</text><text start="364.02" dur="2.16">to defeat the fact that your thing</text><text start="366.18" dur="1.44">could just become a feature somewhere?</text><text start="367.62" dur="1.83">But yeah, that is now
the question with AI.</text><text start="369.45" dur="3.15">It just struck me as such
a difference in approach</text><text start="372.6" dur="3.42">between the product and
the feature version of it,</text><text start="376.02" dur="2.19">and it also struck me that, yeah,</text><text start="378.21" dur="2.28">it feels like Rabbit and Humane</text><text start="380.49" dur="1.2">were kinda doomed from the start</text><text start="381.69" dur="1.71">because there&amp;#39;s no way
they would also develop</text><text start="383.4" dur="2.46">all the other benefits of the big things,</text><text start="385.86" dur="1.26">those being smartphones.</text><text start="387.12" dur="1.53">But also one more quick
thing I wanted to highlight</text><text start="388.65" dur="2.91">that I don&amp;#39;t think got as much attention</text><text start="391.56" dur="1.14">as it maybe deserved,</text><text start="392.7" dur="3.75">which is all of these models
that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text><text start="396.45" dur="1.02">with WWDC,</text><text start="397.47" dur="3.12">all of the models under the
umbrella of Apple Intelligence,</text><text start="400.59" dur="2.37">the diffusion model, the
image generation model,</text><text start="402.96" dur="4.23">the language models
are all built by Apple.</text><text start="407.19" dur="1.38">Like, there was a whole moment on Twitter</text><text start="408.57" dur="0.833">with a lot of confusion</text><text start="409.403" dur="4.447">over just how integrated
ChatGPT is into iOS.</text><text start="413.85" dur="2.76">I think it&amp;#39;s actually not
really that integrated at all.</text><text start="416.61" dur="1.11">So, Apple had to go through the work</text><text start="417.72" dur="1.62">of obviously making all these models,</text><text start="419.34" dur="1.32">but also training them all,</text><text start="420.66" dur="1.68">and so we&amp;#39;ve asked Apple about this.</text><text start="422.34" dur="3.69">They&amp;#39;ve had to go through
finding publicly available data,</text><text start="426.03" dur="1.95">and licensing, and doing that whole dance,</text><text start="427.98" dur="3.03">and spending the millions and
millions of dollars required</text><text start="431.01" dur="1.38">to make these models work.</text><text start="432.39" dur="2.13">So, that is a really
higher barrier to entry,</text><text start="434.52" dur="1.47">but it&amp;#39;s only the once in a while</text><text start="435.99" dur="2.01">that the request is complex enough</text><text start="438" dur="2.37">or deals with enough real-world data,</text><text start="440.37" dur="1.95">which isn&amp;#39;t in Apple&amp;#39;s training,</text><text start="442.32" dur="3.81">that it actually asks, &amp;quot;Okay,
can I go out to ChatGPT?&amp;quot;</text><text start="446.13" dur="2.04">and it asks every single time,</text><text start="448.17" dur="2.64">which feels about as
unintegrated as it gets,</text><text start="450.81" dur="2.04">but generally I think
this is gonna be something</text><text start="452.85" dur="2.1">that&amp;#39;s really hard for other companies,</text><text start="454.95" dur="1.38">for any new companies to pull off.</text><text start="456.33" dur="3.54">This might be the last big
set of models we get to see.</text><text start="459.87" dur="4.89">So, unless you&amp;#39;re Apple or
Google or Microsoft or OpenAI</text><text start="464.76" dur="2.73">or any of the other
massive ones that are safe,</text><text start="467.49" dur="2.37">because they&amp;#39;ll get integrated now,</text><text start="469.86" dur="1.35">probably don&amp;#39;t have much of a shot.</text><text start="471.21" dur="1.11">But either way, this has
been really interesting</text><text start="472.32" dur="0.833">to think about.</text><text start="473.153" dur="4.447">AI, is it a product or a feature?</text><text start="477.6" dur="2.46">Can it be both, or does it
have to be one or the other,</text><text start="480.06" dur="1.71">and one wins and the other loses?</text><text start="481.77" dur="2.1">Let me know what you think in
the comments section below.</text><text start="483.87" dur="1.23">We&amp;#39;ll hang out there.</text><text start="485.1" dur="3.09">Either way, thanks for watching,
thanks for subscribing,</text><text start="488.19" dur="1.949">and I&amp;#39;ll catch you guys in the next one.</text><text start="490.139" dur="0.833">Peace.</text><text start="490.972" dur="2.417">(bold music)</text></transcript>
