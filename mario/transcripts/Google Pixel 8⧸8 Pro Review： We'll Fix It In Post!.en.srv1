<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.26" dur="2.14">- So a common phrase
in the video world is,</text><text start="2.4" dur="1.8">eh, we&amp;#39;ll fix it in post.</text><text start="4.2" dur="2.7">Meaning the shot isn&amp;#39;t quite perfect,</text><text start="6.9" dur="2.823">but we&amp;#39;ll just fix that
stuff in post-production,</text><text start="11.25" dur="0.88">kinda like this.</text><text start="12.13" dur="1.301">(drums rolling)</text><text start="13.431" dur="1.779">(magical music)</text><text start="15.21" dur="1.32">There you go.</text><text start="16.53" dur="1.9">Or how about a little bit of this too?</text><text start="18.43" dur="1.188">(drums rolling)</text><text start="19.618" dur="2.582">(magical music)</text><text start="22.2" dur="1.41">There we go, much better.</text><text start="23.61" dur="2.4">See, it&amp;#39;s not that it&amp;#39;s
a lazy way of doing it,</text><text start="26.01" dur="1.29">but I feel like a good filmmaker</text><text start="27.3" dur="3.18">tries to get as reliably good in camera</text><text start="30.48" dur="2.313">as possible instead of
relying on software.</text><text start="34.53" dur="4.11">And the we&amp;#39;ll fix it in
post version of a smartphone</text><text start="38.64" dur="1.68">is definitely the Google Pixel.</text><text start="40.32" dur="2.4">So many of the Pixel&amp;#39;s best features</text><text start="42.72" dur="2.49">are literally fixing it in post, right?</text><text start="45.21" dur="2.7">Oh, is your face blurry
in that picture you took?</text><text start="47.91" dur="1.5">Fine, Face Unblur.</text><text start="49.41" dur="1.14">Fix it in post.</text><text start="50.55" dur="0.833">Oh, what&amp;#39;s that?</text><text start="51.383" dur="2.107">You didn&amp;#39;t quite get that
angle right on your photo?</text><text start="53.49" dur="0.99">Magic Editor.</text><text start="54.48" dur="1.14">Fix it in post.</text><text start="55.62" dur="1.53">Oh, was there a weird background audio</text><text start="57.15" dur="1.2">in that video you took?</text><text start="58.35" dur="2.67">Easy, we got Audio Eraser, fix it in post,</text><text start="61.02" dur="3.06">and many of these strategies
with a little help from AI,</text><text start="64.08" dur="3.03">actually work and that&amp;#39;s
where the Pixel shines.</text><text start="67.11" dur="2.4">But there&amp;#39;s also some
things about smartphones</text><text start="69.51" dur="3.45">that you kind of just
can&amp;#39;t really fix in post.</text><text start="72.96" dur="0.9">First things first.</text><text start="73.86" dur="2.04">The design on the outside of these phones</text><text start="75.9" dur="1.53">looks, I would say, familiar.</text><text start="77.43" dur="1.68">It looks like the past few years of Pixel</text><text start="79.11" dur="1.41">which I actually really like,</text><text start="80.52" dur="1.77">but I also do think this
one&amp;#39;s a little bit better</text><text start="82.29" dur="0.833">in a few ways.</text><text start="83.123" dur="1.717">First of all, the camera circles</text><text start="84.84" dur="3.18">did the iPhone Dynamic Island thing</text><text start="88.02" dur="2.43">of combining themselves
into one big circle</text><text start="90.45" dur="2.79">which I actually like with
these new bigger sensors here.</text><text start="93.24" dur="2.31">And then also the Pro Pixels now have</text><text start="95.55" dur="1.5">a completely flat display,</text><text start="97.05" dur="2.28">so finally moving away from
the slightly curved edges</text><text start="99.33" dur="3.6">from the past years and a
satin back in every color</text><text start="102.93" dur="2.91">which does a shockingly good
job at hiding fingerprints,</text><text start="105.84" dur="2.04">if your team know case like I am.</text><text start="107.88" dur="0.833">Aside from that though,</text><text start="108.713" dur="1.627">everything else is right
where you&amp;#39;d expect it.</text><text start="110.34" dur="3.09">The one thing I wanna see
if maybe they can fix now</text><text start="113.43" dur="1.65">is the dust that always accumulates</text><text start="115.08" dur="2.04">like right under and above the camera bar.</text><text start="117.12" dur="1.26">Probably the only way to get rid of that</text><text start="118.38" dur="1.95">is to sort of curve it like they did</text><text start="120.33" dur="2.25">on the Oppo Find X4 and X3,</text><text start="122.58" dur="1.2">but I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;ll ever do that.</text><text start="123.78" dur="1.56">But the biggest improvement
to the hardware though</text><text start="125.34" dur="2.82">is definitely upfront,</text><text start="128.16" dur="3.66">honestly to the point where
I feel like these new screens</text><text start="131.82" dur="2.37">sort of tie the phone together
in a way that they&amp;#39;re up</text><text start="134.19" dur="2.43">at the level of any other flagship phone.</text><text start="136.62" dur="2.4">So the smaller Pixel 8 now has</text><text start="139.02" dur="2.73">a 6.2-inch 1080P OLED display,</text><text start="141.75" dur="1.8">slightly smaller than last year.</text><text start="143.55" dur="1.83">And that display is surrounded now</text><text start="145.38" dur="2.43">by perfectly thin even
bezels all the way around,</text><text start="147.81" dur="2.46">no more tiny chin like previous years.</text><text start="150.27" dur="2.7">And it&amp;#39;s now bumped up
to 120 hertz display</text><text start="152.97" dur="4.17">that gets up to a new maximum
2,000 nits of brightness</text><text start="157.14" dur="0.99">which is incredible.</text><text start="158.13" dur="1.08">It&amp;#39;s super bright.</text><text start="159.21" dur="2.28">They&amp;#39;re naming it the Actua display</text><text start="161.49" dur="1.86">because they feel the
need to name everything.</text><text start="163.35" dur="2.37">But I love how it&amp;#39;s visible all the time.</text><text start="165.72" dur="2.52">Auto brightness has also been
behaving this time around</text><text start="168.24" dur="1.26">which is great.</text><text start="169.5" dur="1.14">It&amp;#39;s not LTPO though,</text><text start="170.64" dur="1.74">so you&amp;#39;ll still probably wanna turn off</text><text start="172.38" dur="2.07">the always on display to
save a bit of battery.</text><text start="174.45" dur="4.35">But then the Pixel 8 Pro
has a new 6.7-inch display.</text><text start="178.8" dur="3.06">It is LTPO, it&amp;#39;s closer to 1440P</text><text start="181.86" dur="3.81">and it maxes out at 2,400
nits max brightness.</text><text start="185.67" dur="1.68">This one is legitimately up there</text><text start="187.35" dur="2.31">with the brightest displays I&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text><text start="189.66" dur="1.47">on a smartphone in person</text><text start="191.13" dur="3">and I definitely did not expect
that to come from a Pixel.</text><text start="194.13" dur="2.55">They&amp;#39;re naming this the
Super Actua display.</text><text start="196.68" dur="2.34">So the result is a hardware package</text><text start="199.02" dur="1.08">on the outside of the phone</text><text start="200.1" dur="2.19">that honestly feels like you can put it</text><text start="202.29" dur="2.76">right up alongside any
flagships from Xiaomi,</text><text start="205.05" dur="2.34">Samsung, or anyone else, you name it.</text><text start="207.39" dur="2.34">Just from the way it&amp;#39;s
built, the way it feels,</text><text start="209.73" dur="2.04">the metal rails, the satin back,</text><text start="211.77" dur="2.91">the clickiness of the buttons,
the super bright display,</text><text start="214.68" dur="1.623">the even bezels, everything about it,</text><text start="216.303" dur="3.357">it&amp;#39;s just this is a rare
W for Pixel hardware.</text><text start="219.66" dur="2.13">And then two other small things
about this display, though.</text><text start="221.79" dur="2.55">One, it&amp;#39;s still just a single
front-facing camera at the top</text><text start="224.34" dur="2.25">but Google has found a way with software</text><text start="226.59" dur="2.34">to get more information out of this camera</text><text start="228.93" dur="2.28">in order to be able to
use it for secure unlock</text><text start="231.21" dur="2.55">for things like banking apps
and logging into things.</text><text start="233.76" dur="3.03">So basically instead of
adding more hardware up front</text><text start="236.79" dur="4.59">like an infrared camera or
a dot projector or radar,</text><text start="241.38" dur="3.06">if you remember that,
they just fix it in post</text><text start="244.44" dur="1.74">with software magic and it&amp;#39;s convenient.</text><text start="246.18" dur="1.26">But then number two,</text><text start="247.44" dur="2.79">the fingerprint reader has not improved.</text><text start="250.23" dur="2.04">So remember we were talking
about this in the past few years</text><text start="252.27" dur="2.58">of Pixels, all the best,
the highest end flagships</text><text start="254.85" dur="0.833">feels like they all have</text><text start="255.683" dur="2.107">that super fast ultrasonic
fingerprint reader.</text><text start="257.79" dur="4.35">This one is still optical
and still just a little bit,</text><text start="262.14" dur="2.13">just a beat slower than the high end ones.</text><text start="264.27" dur="3.09">It&amp;#39;s not horrible, but you
can tell it&amp;#39;s not as fast</text><text start="267.36" dur="3.03">or as consistently accurate
with like rain on your phone</text><text start="270.39" dur="1.41">as something like a Samsung phone.</text><text start="271.8" dur="1.65">It&amp;#39;s also not any bigger, either.</text><text start="273.45" dur="1.32">But hey, as long as we&amp;#39;re
talking about the Pixel,</text><text start="274.77" dur="0.84">we might as well just get</text><text start="275.61" dur="1.17">right into talking about the camera</text><text start="276.78" dur="1.98">because this is where you&amp;#39;re gonna see</text><text start="278.76" dur="5">the fix it in post pushed
to its absolute maximum,</text><text start="284.04" dur="1.02">more than any other phone.</text><text start="285.06" dur="2.16">So the new camera
sensors across the board,</text><text start="287.22" dur="1.74">they do plenty of heavy
lifting, of course,</text><text start="288.96" dur="2.7">it&amp;#39;s a big 50-megapixel primary sensor</text><text start="291.66" dur="2.4">shared across both the 8 and the 8 Pro,</text><text start="294.06" dur="4.71">F1.7 OIS and Pixel photos, they look good,</text><text start="298.77" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re sharp, there&amp;#39;s tons
of dynamic range as expected.</text><text start="301.77" dur="1.56">Auto focus is really fast</text><text start="303.33" dur="1.68">and it can get a pretty
shallow depth of field</text><text start="305.01" dur="1.89">with close up subjects, which is nice.</text><text start="306.9" dur="2.13">But really most of what you&amp;#39;re looking at</text><text start="309.03" dur="3.54">when you look at a Pixel
photo or video is software.</text><text start="312.57" dur="2.04">So the multiple exposures blended together</text><text start="314.61" dur="1.86">into a single HDR shot,</text><text start="316.47" dur="3.27">the strategic relighting
of recognized faces.</text><text start="319.74" dur="1.32">I also, I do feel like there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="321.06" dur="1.77">a little extra noise reduction this year.</text><text start="322.83" dur="2.91">So sometimes details
get kind of watercolory</text><text start="325.74" dur="1.83">but at least there&amp;#39;s enough resolution</text><text start="327.57" dur="2.31">that it doesn&amp;#39;t look
terrible when zoomed out.</text><text start="329.88" dur="1.8">And I&amp;#39;ve also found there
is definitely a tendency</text><text start="331.68" dur="2.79">to over-HDR some images sometimes.</text><text start="334.47" dur="2.79">And when it comes to
features, well, oh my god,</text><text start="337.26" dur="1.32">there are so many now.</text><text start="338.58" dur="2.61">You probably already
know about Magic Eraser.</text><text start="341.19" dur="0.833">Look, oh, what&amp;#39;s that?</text><text start="342.023" dur="1.927">You&amp;#39;ve taken a photo and
someone&amp;#39;s in the background,</text><text start="343.95" dur="1.17">you wanna get rid of &amp;#39;em.</text><text start="345.12" dur="2.85">Boom, Magic Eraser, fix it in post.</text><text start="347.97" dur="0.833">Oh, what&amp;#39;s that?</text><text start="348.803" dur="2.347">You have a photo where someone&amp;#39;s
moving a little too fast</text><text start="351.15" dur="2.49">or the hands were shaky and
the face is kind of blurry.</text><text start="353.64" dur="2.67">Well, there&amp;#39;s a feature
called Face Unblur,</text><text start="356.31" dur="1.26">literally fix it in post.</text><text start="357.57" dur="2.52">And then even this new
one called The Best Take,</text><text start="360.09" dur="1.83">people with kids are gonna love this one.</text><text start="361.92" dur="2.55">Basically, you know how
anytime you take a group photo</text><text start="364.47" dur="1.62">where there&amp;#39;s like five or
six people in the photo,</text><text start="366.09" dur="2.61">you just blast, you just
take a bunch of pictures</text><text start="368.7" dur="2.67">and inevitably, one person&amp;#39;s face,</text><text start="371.37" dur="2.16">they&amp;#39;re either blinking
or sneezing or something.</text><text start="373.53" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s never perfect.</text><text start="374.363" dur="2.797">But this feature will let
you go into that group shot.</text><text start="377.16" dur="2.16">And this is for any group
shot you&amp;#39;ve ever taken</text><text start="379.32" dur="1.56">in your Google Photos library, by the way,</text><text start="380.88" dur="1.68">not just a shot on the Pixel.</text><text start="382.56" dur="2.97">And it automatically
recognizes the burst of photos</text><text start="385.53" dur="3.03">and lets you pick the best
face from the whole burst</text><text start="388.56" dur="2.49">on each person in the photo</text><text start="391.05" dur="2.31">with surprisingly impressive accuracy.</text><text start="393.36" dur="2.16">You will genuinely never
have that one person</text><text start="395.52" dur="1.65">with their eyes closed
or looking the wrong way</text><text start="397.17" dur="1.71">in a group photo ever again.</text><text start="398.88" dur="2.61">I guess that makes your
holiday cards that much easier.</text><text start="401.49" dur="1.35">But also even in videos, you know,</text><text start="402.84" dur="2.85">I&amp;#39;ve taken a lot of videos
on the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro,</text><text start="405.69" dur="1.92">there&amp;#39;s a lot of processing happening.</text><text start="407.61" dur="3.09">I do think Pixel video is
improved over last year.</text><text start="410.7" dur="1.65">It&amp;#39;s less noisy in the shadows</text><text start="412.35" dur="1.77">and there&amp;#39;s some nice
shallow depth of field</text><text start="414.12" dur="1.95">with quick autofocus.</text><text start="416.07" dur="4.08">I shot almost the entire
Corvette Z06 autofocus video</text><text start="420.15" dur="2.4">on the Pixel 8 Pro and I
think it looks really good,</text><text start="422.55" dur="3.21">but also in a lot of the shots of my face,</text><text start="425.76" dur="3.06">there&amp;#39;s this artificial
brightening processing,</text><text start="428.82" dur="3.12">like you can see it in my
footage before I start talking.</text><text start="431.94" dur="3.39">When it lands on my face, how
it just brightens up my face</text><text start="435.33" dur="3.06">and adds this contrast and
just throughout the footage,</text><text start="438.39" dur="3.81">there is a good amount of
processed sharpening going on.</text><text start="442.2" dur="2.67">Also, the Audio Eraser video feature</text><text start="444.87" dur="2.91">is all right, I would say.</text><text start="447.78" dur="2.55">Again, you can only fix so much in post,</text><text start="450.33" dur="1.71">but basically they show this feature</text><text start="452.04" dur="1.2">where if you&amp;#39;re taking videos</text><text start="453.24" dur="2.1">and there&amp;#39;s some background noise,</text><text start="455.34" dur="1.41">you can go into the editor</text><text start="456.75" dur="3.39">and separate out like the
layers of different sounds.</text><text start="460.14" dur="1.74">So there&amp;#39;s this really cool UI</text><text start="461.88" dur="2.46">that they&amp;#39;ve built in
that is super impressive.</text><text start="464.34" dur="2.49">You go into Edit Audio and Audio Eraser.</text><text start="466.83" dur="3.75">It analyzes the video and
then lets you drag up or down</text><text start="470.58" dur="2.91">levels of different
sounds it&amp;#39;s identified.</text><text start="473.49" dur="4.08">So nature and voices and background sounds</text><text start="477.57" dur="3.06">and wind, you know, depends
on what video you took.</text><text start="480.63" dur="4.32">It does okay with small
stuff, but like, I don&amp;#39;t know,</text><text start="484.95" dur="1.38">it&amp;#39;s super impressive at a low level,</text><text start="486.33" dur="3.06">but then it can&amp;#39;t really
save the most disruptive wind</text><text start="489.39" dur="2.31">around our studio or the exhaust sound</text><text start="491.7" dur="2.58">of a five and a half liter
naturally aspirated V8.</text><text start="494.28" dur="1.74">Like it&amp;#39;s not magic.</text><text start="496.02" dur="1.2">About this in the main channel</text><text start="497.22" dur="2.13">in the Rimac Nevera video.</text><text start="499.35" dur="1.59">That car is electric</text><text start="500.94" dur="2.64">and basically has multiple personalities</text><text start="503.58" dur="1.92">and this one kind of does in the same way.</text><text start="505.5" dur="1.98">You&amp;#39;ve probably heard the other cliche of.</text><text start="507.48" dur="1.65">I will say shout out to the colors though.</text><text start="509.13" dur="3.33">Honestly the color in
Pixel video is really good.</text><text start="512.46" dur="2.58">If you told me I could only take pictures</text><text start="515.04" dur="3.48">by taking stills from
video of any smartphone,</text><text start="518.52" dur="2.04">I think I would pick the Pixel 8 Pro.</text><text start="520.56" dur="1.95">Just the footage looks so good.</text><text start="522.51" dur="3.63">Now Google, here&amp;#39;s the
thing about being so good</text><text start="526.14" dur="4.14">at software visibly is it
becomes way more obvious</text><text start="530.28" dur="3.12">when you&amp;#39;re suddenly not able
to pull off a software trick</text><text start="533.4" dur="2.76">on the non-Pro phone that
you are able to pull off</text><text start="536.16" dur="2.76">on the Pro phone, even though
they&amp;#39;re the same computer.</text><text start="538.92" dur="4.17">Like the good thing that you
did was put the same exact chip</text><text start="543.09" dur="3.24">the Tensor G3 with the
same image signal processor</text><text start="546.33" dur="3.9">and the same primary camera
and the same selfie camera</text><text start="550.23" dur="2.25">in the pro and the non-Pro phones.</text><text start="552.48" dur="2.7">So this sort of artificial separation</text><text start="555.18" dur="4.653">between the Pro and the non-Pro
with like software locking,</text><text start="560.76" dur="1.26">it was obvious when Apple did it</text><text start="562.02" dur="2.43">and it&amp;#39;s even more obvious
when Google does it.</text><text start="564.45" dur="0.99">So if you open up the camera</text><text start="565.44" dur="1.74">and switch over to Pro Controls,</text><text start="567.18" dur="2.58">that&amp;#39;s only available on the Pro phone.</text><text start="569.76" dur="0.833">Now, that&amp;#39;s funny.</text><text start="570.593" dur="1.837">Of course, you can argue the non-Pro phone</text><text start="572.43" dur="3.6">doesn&amp;#39;t need Pro controls, but
it&amp;#39;s clearly capable of them.</text><text start="576.03" dur="2.22">Even if you bury them in
settings, it&amp;#39;s the same computer.</text><text start="578.25" dur="2.85">They also both have a 50-megapixel sensor,</text><text start="581.1" dur="2.13">but because it&amp;#39;s locked
under the Pro mode,</text><text start="583.23" dur="3.63">you can only take 50-megapixel
shots on the Pro phone.</text><text start="586.86" dur="1.83">The non-Pro phone is always binning.</text><text start="588.69" dur="1.38">Theoretically that&amp;#39;s
gonna be one of the things</text><text start="590.07" dur="1.95">that you&amp;#39;ll have to pay
the 300 extra dollars</text><text start="592.02" dur="1.92">to get up to the Pro phone for,</text><text start="593.94" dur="3.21">but also someone&amp;#39;s already
ported it to the Pixel 6.</text><text start="597.15" dur="2.55">So like, come on, Google, you ain&amp;#39;t slick.</text><text start="599.7" dur="1.86">There&amp;#39;s even a blog post
about some other features</text><text start="601.56" dur="1.26">that are coming to the Pixel.</text><text start="602.82" dur="2.19">They have this thing called Zoom Enhance.</text><text start="605.01" dur="3.69">That&amp;#39;s basically a generative
fill version of Super Res Zoom</text><text start="608.7" dur="1.74">that&amp;#39;s coming later this year</text><text start="610.44" dur="2.7">only to Pixel 8 Pro for some reason.</text><text start="613.14" dur="2.7">And especially improved
MagicERraser version</text><text start="615.84" dur="2.04">that uses Generative Fill</text><text start="617.88" dur="2.64">on the 8 Pro and only the 8 Pro.</text><text start="620.52" dur="1.47">- It&amp;#39;s ridiculous.</text><text start="621.99" dur="1.83">It&amp;#39;s obvious what&amp;#39;s being done out here.</text><text start="623.82" dur="1.47">It&amp;#39;s a nightly basis.</text><text start="625.29" dur="1.32">I hope the world can see now</text><text start="626.61" dur="0.917">what&amp;#39;s really going on out here</text><text start="627.527" dur="1.813">&amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s getting ridiculous.</text><text start="629.34" dur="1.17">It&amp;#39;s really ridiculous.</text><text start="630.51" dur="1.44">- Okay, last camera thing.</text><text start="631.95" dur="3.87">Magic Editor is...</text><text start="635.82" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s wild.</text><text start="636.653" dur="2.257">It&amp;#39;s one of the wildest
things they&amp;#39;ve ever made.</text><text start="638.91" dur="1.86">It is available on both phones</text><text start="640.77" dur="3.12">and it definitely goes
beyond fixing it in post.</text><text start="643.89" dur="2.22">So you open up a photo, you hit Edit,</text><text start="646.11" dur="1.53">and then at the bottom left corner,</text><text start="647.64" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;s this wonderful colorful
rainbow Magic Editor button</text><text start="651.54" dur="1.8">just tempting you to press it.</text><text start="653.34" dur="2.97">From here, the editor
UI is basically saying,</text><text start="656.31" dur="3.33">all right, go ahead and select
something with your hands</text><text start="659.64" dur="1.11">and then we can change it.</text><text start="660.75" dur="1.29">We can do whatever you want to it.</text><text start="662.04" dur="3.75">Select an object and you can
remove it, move it around,</text><text start="665.79" dur="3.54">resize it, select a person,
we can move &amp;#39;em up or down</text><text start="669.33" dur="3.84">or hit the bottom middle button
to switch the whole scene</text><text start="673.17" dur="3.78">to golden hour or replace
the entire sky in your photo.</text><text start="676.95" dur="1.74">And then once you submit the edit</text><text start="678.69" dur="1.53">it takes a few seconds to process,</text><text start="680.22" dur="1.14">and then kind of like DALL·E,</text><text start="681.36" dur="2.55">it gives you four options of this edit</text><text start="683.91" dur="2.55">to pick whichever version
is the most convincing.</text><text start="686.46" dur="3.06">They&amp;#39;re not, you know, professional
photographer level edits</text><text start="689.52" dur="1.71">meaning you can zoom in and Pixel peep</text><text start="691.23" dur="3.03">and find some edges sometimes
that look weird here or there.</text><text start="694.26" dur="3.6">I also did try the exact
same Generative Fill example</text><text start="697.86" dur="1.62">that they showed in their commercials</text><text start="699.48" dur="1.32">of this kid on a park bench</text><text start="700.8" dur="2.64">where it oppressively fills
in the missing balloons.</text><text start="703.44" dur="2.58">When I do it, it kind of tries to do that,</text><text start="706.02" dur="3">but definitely doesn&amp;#39;t
do it nearly as well.</text><text start="709.02" dur="3">But the truth is zoomed all the way out,</text><text start="712.02" dur="3.45">these are decently convincing
edits to regular people</text><text start="715.47" dur="2.1">and you can just do it with
any photo in your library,</text><text start="717.57" dur="2.49">so it really just feels
like without knowing</text><text start="720.06" dur="1.23">how to use Photoshop</text><text start="721.29" dur="2.7">or any of these image generation AI tools,</text><text start="723.99" dur="2.52">the Pixel Magic Editor,
basically what it did</text><text start="726.51" dur="5">is just it lowered the barrier
to entry to just lie I guess.</text><text start="732.27" dur="2.34">Now every once in a while,
I did get a popup box</text><text start="734.61" dur="3.84">over my edit attempt that said
it&amp;#39;s unable to show results</text><text start="738.45" dur="3.69">because it might violate our gen AI terms.</text><text start="742.14" dur="2.4">But I was never able to
find like exactly why</text><text start="744.54" dur="1.59">or any trend in this.</text><text start="746.13" dur="1.56">It seemed to come up more often</text><text start="747.69" dur="1.86">when I tried to edit
a picture of a person,</text><text start="749.55" dur="2.37">but then it would totally let
me just select a watermark</text><text start="751.92" dur="2.43">in a photo and effortlessly delete that,</text><text start="754.35" dur="2.97">which is probably gonna be
concern for some photographers.</text><text start="757.32" dur="2.19">So yeah, I would just say
that I&amp;#39;m probably gonna end up</text><text start="759.51" dur="2.61">making an entire separate
video just about this tool</text><text start="762.12" dur="0.9">&amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s fascinating</text><text start="763.02" dur="3.6">and what it brings into the world is wild.</text><text start="766.62" dur="1.8">But I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="768.42" dur="0.87">What is a photo?</text><text start="769.29" dur="2.76">But you know what you
can&amp;#39;t fix in post, though?</text><text start="772.05" dur="1.08">Battery life.</text><text start="773.13" dur="4.95">You can&amp;#39;t AI your way out
of a huge 2,400 nit screen</text><text start="778.08" dur="0.9">burning through battery.</text><text start="778.98" dur="1.5">You&amp;#39;re just gonna need the hardware,</text><text start="780.48" dur="1.53">you&amp;#39;re gonna need a big battery</text><text start="782.01" dur="1.95">you&amp;#39;re gonna need an
efficient chip for this one.</text><text start="783.96" dur="1.77">And I&amp;#39;m happy to report</text><text start="785.73" dur="3.12">that I have had really good
battery life on the Pixels.</text><text start="788.85" dur="1.53">And this is especially on the 8 Pro.</text><text start="790.38" dur="2.67">So I&amp;#39;ve gotten six to eight
hours of screen on time</text><text start="793.05" dur="2.64">regularly, standby time has been decent.</text><text start="795.69" dur="3.45">My only real question at this
point is, and I only ask this</text><text start="799.14" dur="2.01">because of the history
we&amp;#39;ve seen with the Pixel,</text><text start="801.15" dur="3.27">how long will the battery
life be this good?</text><text start="804.42" dur="2.76">Because, you know, it could
be great for a few months</text><text start="807.18" dur="2.16">and then start to fade
like previous Pixels,</text><text start="809.34" dur="1.47">or maybe it&amp;#39;ll be great for years,</text><text start="810.81" dur="1.59">the whole time you own the phone.</text><text start="812.4" dur="0.9">Only time will tell.</text><text start="813.3" dur="2.31">At the end of the day though,
the Pixel is still great</text><text start="815.61" dur="3.09">at what it&amp;#39;s always been great
at, which is being smart.</text><text start="818.7" dur="1.68">Like there are so many features,</text><text start="820.38" dur="3.39">from call screening, to
Google Assistant everywhere,</text><text start="823.77" dur="2.16">Google&amp;#39;s stock apps getting so good.</text><text start="825.93" dur="2.22">And the more I use the
Pixel as my daily phone,</text><text start="828.15" dur="1.35">as I have for so long,</text><text start="829.5" dur="2.1">the more I just kind of
get used to this stuff</text><text start="831.6" dur="2.61">and the harder it is to live
without it on another phone.</text><text start="834.21" dur="1.59">Android 14 has already breathed life</text><text start="835.8" dur="1.62">into older pixels already.</text><text start="837.42" dur="1.74">Literally my biggest primary bug</text><text start="839.16" dur="2.88">is clicking Twitter
notifications, for some reason,</text><text start="842.04" dur="2.97">Just take an extra beat
and a half to open.</text><text start="845.01" dur="0.833">Kind of weird.</text><text start="845.843" dur="2.197">One of the new features on this one</text><text start="848.04" dur="2.07">is when you&amp;#39;re in any webpage in Chrome,</text><text start="850.11" dur="2.22">you can pull up Google
Assistant and just ask it</text><text start="852.33" dur="2.43">for a summary of the entire
webpage you&amp;#39;re reading.</text><text start="854.76" dur="2.22">And Google Assistant
with this new AI features</text><text start="856.98" dur="2.64">reads your screen and generates a summary</text><text start="859.62" dur="1.5">of three or four bullet points</text><text start="861.12" dur="1.41">that are typically pretty good.</text><text start="862.53" dur="1.92">Now I wanna try this
with a few other apps,</text><text start="864.45" dur="1.86">but I basically always got an error saying</text><text start="866.31" dur="1.68">this app doesn&amp;#39;t support summaries,</text><text start="867.99" dur="2.28">So it looks like the app developers</text><text start="870.27" dur="2.22">are gonna have to opt in
to have their apps scraped</text><text start="872.49" dur="1.95">by the summaries which I kind of suspect</text><text start="874.44" dur="1.35">a lot of them are not gonna do that.</text><text start="875.79" dur="2.55">Even Google&amp;#39;s own news
app doesn&amp;#39;t support it.</text><text start="878.34" dur="2.55">So this basically is just a Chrome thing.</text><text start="880.89" dur="0.99">And then after the summary,</text><text start="881.88" dur="2.55">it gives you a few cards
to ask follow up questions</text><text start="884.43" dur="2.64">about the subject and just
keep Googling more stuff.</text><text start="887.07" dur="1.83">But then just this phone</text><text start="888.9" dur="2.31">gets a lot of the little stuff right too.</text><text start="891.21" dur="3.09">Just the little things that
make it feel like a flagship.</text><text start="894.3" dur="1.89">The haptics are excellent.</text><text start="896.19" dur="2.13">Like it&amp;#39;s got some of the
highest quality phone calls</text><text start="898.32" dur="2.25">I&amp;#39;ve ever heard on a
phone, stuff like that.</text><text start="900.57" dur="3.42">Overall, when you put fit
and finish and hardware</text><text start="903.99" dur="2.4">up alongside software experience,</text><text start="906.39" dur="1.71">and I think these new screens especially,</text><text start="908.1" dur="2.94">it feels like this is finally
the generation of Pixel</text><text start="911.04" dur="3.18">that is right alongside
the other flagships</text><text start="914.22" dur="0.93">of the smartphone world.</text><text start="915.15" dur="2.16">And it gets supported like a flagship too.</text><text start="917.31" dur="1.98">Seven years of software updates,</text><text start="919.29" dur="2.04">seven years of feature drop updates,</text><text start="921.33" dur="2.01">seven years of security updates,</text><text start="923.34" dur="2.01">seven years of spare parts available.</text><text start="925.35" dur="2.943">And it&amp;#39;ll do so for the
new starting price of $700.</text><text start="930.03" dur="1.02">And I think it&amp;#39;s worth it.</text><text start="931.05" dur="2.01">I honestly, I think this
is worth the new price tag.</text><text start="933.06" dur="1.95">I think everything they&amp;#39;ve
done from the 120 hertz</text><text start="935.01" dur="1.86">and the brighter screen across the board,</text><text start="936.87" dur="2.7">this is a phone that I would
have no problem recommending.</text><text start="939.57" dur="4.26">Now, is the 300 extra
dollars for the Pro worth it?</text><text start="943.83" dur="0.96">That one&amp;#39;s gonna be tough.</text><text start="944.79" dur="2.85">And again, it&amp;#39;s because
Google did such a good job</text><text start="947.64" dur="3.21">with feature parity, same
chip, same primary camera</text><text start="950.85" dur="1.98">between these, so it&amp;#39;s gonna come down</text><text start="952.83" dur="2.31">to the couple of small
differences between them.</text><text start="955.14" dur="3.09">Do you want that telephoto
camera and the bigger screen,</text><text start="958.23" dur="3.96">bigger battery, bigger phone,
the temperature sensor?</text><text start="962.19" dur="1.11">I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="963.3" dur="2.37">It&amp;#39;s harder to recommend
the Pro for most people,</text><text start="965.67" dur="2.48">but the Pixel 8, this is a good phone.</text><text start="968.15" dur="1.15">So that&amp;#39;s basically it.</text><text start="969.3" dur="1.14">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="970.44" dur="1.38">Catch you guys in the next one.</text><text start="971.82" dur="0.833">Peace.</text><text start="972.653" dur="2.411">(light music)</text></transcript>
