<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.109" dur="3.101">(bouncy upbeat music)</text><text start="3.21" dur="1.77">- So every sport has some sort</text><text start="4.98" dur="2.64">of tech involved in the
show somewhere now, right?</text><text start="7.62" dur="3.18">Like tennis has the famous
replay in or out graphic.</text><text start="10.8" dur="1.89">American football has the digital line</text><text start="12.69" dur="1.14">of scrimmage we all know.</text><text start="13.83" dur="3.27">And football, football has
this sweet new offsides graphic</text><text start="17.1" dur="3.09">and golf has this,</text><text start="20.19" dur="0.9">the shot tracer.</text><text start="21.09" dur="1.26">So some of you who&amp;#39;ve been subscribed</text><text start="22.35" dur="1.17">for a long time already know this,</text><text start="23.52" dur="1.74">but many of you also don&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="25.26" dur="2.91">I am a golfer. I&amp;#39;ve been
golfing for a long time.</text><text start="28.17" dur="2.4">Longer than I&amp;#39;ve been
doing like anything else.</text><text start="30.57" dur="2.04">My first ever YouTube upload,</text><text start="32.61" dur="2.07">before any other tech videos,</text><text start="34.68" dur="2.613">was a couple of golf
videos, believe it or not.</text><text start="38.471" dur="1.549">- [Speaker] Come back,
nice ball, good drive.</text><text start="40.02" dur="2.37">- But I do still watch golf all the time.</text><text start="42.39" dur="2.91">And of course, after doing
that Formula 1 video,</text><text start="45.3" dur="2.67">my brain is in tech in sports mode</text><text start="47.97" dur="1.83">and I&amp;#39;m realizing the amount</text><text start="49.8" dur="4.23">of technology hidden in
plain sight on a golf course</text><text start="54.03" dur="2.82">that makes a broadcast possible</text><text start="56.85" dur="0.93">is actually insane.</text><text start="57.78" dur="3.48">There&amp;#39;s cameras, there&amp;#39;s
also lasers, there&amp;#39;s radar,</text><text start="61.26" dur="2.49">LiDAR, optical fiber cables,</text><text start="63.75" dur="2.13">there&amp;#39;s volunteers carrying Samsung phones</text><text start="65.88" dur="1.56">with a custom app installed on them.</text><text start="67.44" dur="2.52">There&amp;#39;s so much happening here. But why?</text><text start="69.96" dur="2.46">And when you think about it,
there&amp;#39;s really one good reason</text><text start="72.42" dur="1.56">for all this stuff going on,</text><text start="73.98" dur="4.2">which is golf is hard to watch,</text><text start="78.18" dur="1.62">for a lot of the same reasons</text><text start="79.8" dur="2.4">that Formula 1 is hard to watch.</text><text start="82.2" dur="1.89">Like this sport, it&amp;#39;s not just like,</text><text start="84.09" dur="1.59">it&amp;#39;s not one basketball court,</text><text start="85.68" dur="1.92">where all the action is
happening in the same place</text><text start="87.6" dur="1.14">at the same time.</text><text start="88.74" dur="4.26">It&amp;#39;s 18 different courts
all spread around,</text><text start="93" dur="1.83">hundreds of yards away from each other,</text><text start="94.83" dur="3.69">all with different action
happening on them at the same time</text><text start="98.52" dur="2.37">with a tiny little white
ball flying through the air</text><text start="100.89" dur="1.71">that&amp;#39;s impossible to see.</text><text start="102.6" dur="2.64">So when you&amp;#39;re not physically
at the golf course,</text><text start="105.24" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s basically three
ways to watch golf,</text><text start="108.54" dur="3.66">each requiring more
technology than the last.</text><text start="112.2" dur="4.65">There&amp;#39;s the TV broadcast,
there&amp;#39;s the website portal,</text><text start="116.85" dur="2.713">and then there&amp;#39;s the Vision Pro.</text><text start="119.563" dur="2.507">(upbeat music)</text><text start="122.07" dur="3">So the TV broadcast, it&amp;#39;s
the most simple, right?</text><text start="125.07" dur="2.43">But there&amp;#39;s still this flagship problem</text><text start="127.5" dur="1.95">of the golf ball being tiny</text><text start="129.45" dur="2.61">and basically invisible
as soon as it gets hit.</text><text start="132.06" dur="4.47">And so that problem was
solved with the shot tracer.</text><text start="136.53" dur="2.19">Now a lot of people don&amp;#39;t
actually know how this gets made.</text><text start="138.72" dur="1.65">Like it&amp;#39;s not a computer drawing a trace</text><text start="140.37" dur="2.58">of where it kind of sees
the golf ball going.</text><text start="142.95" dur="2.55">It&amp;#39;s not an AI prediction of anything.</text><text start="145.5" dur="3.93">It&amp;#39;s actually very precisely
measured accurately.</text><text start="149.43" dur="1.53">So if you&amp;#39;ve ever been
around a golf course</text><text start="150.96" dur="2.46">or looking at a broadcast
during a tournament,</text><text start="153.42" dur="3.99">you&amp;#39;ll notice there are a ton of these,</text><text start="157.41" dur="1.5">these little towers here.</text><text start="158.91" dur="2.34">Well, they&amp;#39;re not so little
towers sometimes too.</text><text start="161.25" dur="2.28">But these towers are strategically placed</text><text start="163.53" dur="3.51">all the way around the golf
course, behind the tee boxes,</text><text start="167.04" dur="1.14">around the fairways,</text><text start="168.18" dur="2.58">and behind the greens
so that they&amp;#39;re covering</text><text start="170.76" dur="1.95">the entire golf course.</text><text start="172.71" dur="3">And every single one of these
towers has three things,</text><text start="175.71" dur="4.11">a camera, a TrackMan, and
a wireless transmitter.</text><text start="179.82" dur="2.7">So this TrackMan right here,
this is the special thing.</text><text start="182.52" dur="1.86">This is the radar system used</text><text start="184.38" dur="3.18">to measure the exact
launch speed and angle</text><text start="187.56" dur="1.95">and spin rates of the golf ball</text><text start="189.51" dur="2.1">the instant it&amp;#39;s contacted by a golf club.</text><text start="191.61" dur="0.833">And then here&amp;#39;s the thing,</text><text start="192.443" dur="1.327">once that gets measured,</text><text start="193.77" dur="3.12">instantly the computers
know everything about how</text><text start="196.89" dur="2.28">that golf ball is going
to fly through the air,</text><text start="199.17" dur="1.02">as soon as it touch the ball,</text><text start="200.19" dur="3.18">how high it&amp;#39;ll go, how far
it&amp;#39;ll go, how much it&amp;#39;ll turn.</text><text start="203.37" dur="2.94">And all of that will be even
more useful in the next level.</text><text start="206.31" dur="2.82">But for this TV broadcast,
from the launch data,</text><text start="209.13" dur="2.94">they can immediately
project a shot shape line</text><text start="212.07" dur="3.72">overlaid onto the hole using
the angle from the fixed camera</text><text start="215.79" dur="1.62">that&amp;#39;s sitting right behind the tee box</text><text start="217.41" dur="3.39">and immediately get that data
back to the broadcast trucks.</text><text start="220.8" dur="2.07">Now the crazy part is,</text><text start="222.87" dur="1.86">if you look around enough,</text><text start="224.73" dur="2.04">you will see these things
all over the golf course,</text><text start="226.77" dur="2.04">they&amp;#39;re hidden in plain sight basically.</text><text start="228.81" dur="3.33">Some of them are right next
to the golfers at the tee box.</text><text start="232.14" dur="3.72">Some of &amp;#39;em are actually
strapped up to TV towers.</text><text start="235.86" dur="1.77">And it&amp;#39;s not just the tee boxes.</text><text start="237.63" dur="3.51">The TrackMan launch monitors
actually face backwards</text><text start="241.14" dur="1.59">from behind the green too,</text><text start="242.73" dur="3.24">so they can pick up launch
data from all kinds of shots,</text><text start="245.97" dur="1.56">shots from the fairway.</text><text start="247.53" dur="1.08">It&amp;#39;s super impressive.</text><text start="248.61" dur="2.16">And then all of these towers
that I got to check out,</text><text start="250.77" dur="2.55">turns out they&amp;#39;re all
completely battery powered</text><text start="253.32" dur="2.46">and can last for an entire
day of a tournament.</text><text start="255.78" dur="2.52">And then also this skirt around the bottom</text><text start="258.3" dur="2.13">is actually covered in solar panels too.</text><text start="260.43" dur="2.46">So they&amp;#39;re basically
feeding into themselves</text><text start="262.89" dur="2.07">and they never run out
of power during the day.</text><text start="264.96" dur="3.66">All of this is to just
give us the shot tracer</text><text start="268.62" dur="3.605">that makes golf on TV
dramatically easier to watch.</text><text start="272.225" dur="2.667">(upbeat music)</text><text start="277.68" dur="3.42">Now sometimes, you can&amp;#39;t
always watch golf on TV.</text><text start="281.1" dur="0.87">You know, maybe you&amp;#39;re at work</text><text start="281.97" dur="1.77">or maybe you&amp;#39;re somewhere else
where you can&amp;#39;t be in front</text><text start="283.74" dur="1.98">of a TV, but you got another tab open</text><text start="285.72" dur="2.58">just so you can keep an eye
on the PGA Tour website,</text><text start="288.3" dur="1.8">so you can see what&amp;#39;s happening.</text><text start="290.1" dur="2.79">Lucky for you, they have
built this thing out.</text><text start="292.89" dur="2.91">So the website now has
this entire real time</text><text start="295.8" dur="3.48">play-by-play portal where you
can jump around to any hole</text><text start="299.28" dur="3.15">and see exactly what&amp;#39;s
happening when it happens.</text><text start="302.43" dur="1.29">And then when the tournament is happening,</text><text start="303.72" dur="1.98">every shot is updated in real time.</text><text start="305.7" dur="2.16">But what I didn&amp;#39;t realize
until seeing it in person</text><text start="307.86" dur="3.3">is just how far they go to
deliver all of these shots</text><text start="311.16" dur="1.14">as soon as possible.</text><text start="312.3" dur="0.833">So check this out.</text><text start="313.133" dur="0.997">So there&amp;#39;s a few more pieces</text><text start="314.13" dur="2.25">of tech on the golf course
that you should know about.</text><text start="316.38" dur="2.85">First of all, there are
these on fairway cameras</text><text start="319.23" dur="1.44">covering the whole course.</text><text start="320.67" dur="1.2">And basically they&amp;#39;re like that tower</text><text start="321.87" dur="1.5">that I showed you on the tee box earlier,</text><text start="323.37" dur="1.68">but it doesn&amp;#39;t need any TrackMan on it.</text><text start="325.05" dur="2.22">It&amp;#39;s just cameras and
they&amp;#39;re pointed everywhere.</text><text start="327.27" dur="1.62">And then there are also</text><text start="328.89" dur="3">volunteers stationed alongside every hole</text><text start="331.89" dur="2.43">with laser range finders and tablets.</text><text start="334.32" dur="1.71">So they&amp;#39;ve got this nice
little setup to be able</text><text start="336.03" dur="3.66">to quickly tag a ball as soon as it lands</text><text start="339.69" dur="2.19">and then upload its exact location.</text><text start="341.88" dur="2.31">So here&amp;#39;s how it all works. Ready?</text><text start="344.19" dur="1.98">So a golfer&amp;#39;s up on the tee box,</text><text start="346.17" dur="1.71">they&amp;#39;re about to hit their first shot.</text><text start="347.88" dur="1.65">You&amp;#39;ve loaded up the website.</text><text start="349.53" dur="2.94">Remember how I said those radar
trackers can compute exactly</text><text start="352.47" dur="1.53">what the ball is going to do</text><text start="354" dur="2.4">the second the club impacts the ball?</text><text start="356.4" dur="3.36">Well, okay perfect, so
that data is shot over</text><text start="359.76" dur="2.43">to the Shotlink trailer in the parking lot</text><text start="362.19" dur="2.25">where they have the feeds
from all the cameras</text><text start="364.44" dur="1.5">all over the golf course.</text><text start="365.94" dur="1.08">And this is the crazy part.</text><text start="367.02" dur="2.37">The second the shot gets hit,</text><text start="369.39" dur="4.5">that system is already projecting
a polygon on the course</text><text start="373.89" dur="2.4">where it thinks the
ball is going to end up.</text><text start="376.29" dur="3.33">You can actually see it right
here, outlined in yellow.</text><text start="379.62" dur="3.63">Then a few seconds later,
boom, the ball lands</text><text start="383.25" dur="2.85">and rolls right into that box.</text><text start="386.1" dur="1.26">It&amp;#39;s so sick.</text><text start="387.36" dur="1.98">So then, the volunteer with the laser</text><text start="389.34" dur="2.1">and the tablet will laser the ball</text><text start="391.44" dur="2.88">and get its exact location
just to confirm that,</text><text start="394.32" dur="2.82">upload it, boom, it immediately shows up</text><text start="397.14" dur="1.23">on the Tour website.</text><text start="398.37" dur="3.54">Literally within three seconds
of the ball coming to rest,</text><text start="401.91" dur="1.11">it is updated.</text><text start="403.02" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s pretty impressive.</text><text start="403.853" dur="2.587">And the craziest part to me
was seeing this system at work,</text><text start="406.44" dur="2.13">like predicting where the
ball is going to land.</text><text start="408.57" dur="3.21">Again, before it even lands,
as soon as they hit the ball,</text><text start="411.78" dur="2.91">it is accounting for obviously
the launch angle, the spin,</text><text start="414.69" dur="4.08">the speed, but also things
like the wind, the temperature,</text><text start="418.77" dur="2.1">the humidity, your elevation,</text><text start="420.87" dur="3.03">and all of that stuff
to give you that polygon</text><text start="423.9" dur="2.64">for probability for where the
ball&amp;#39;s probably gonna end up.</text><text start="426.54" dur="1.35">Now, obviously it won&amp;#39;t be perfect,</text><text start="427.89" dur="2.1">especially if the ball
does something unexpected,</text><text start="429.99" dur="2.76">like hits a tree or a bird or something.</text><text start="432.75" dur="2.82">But that&amp;#39;s why you have the
volunteer down on the course</text><text start="435.57" dur="3.99">with the laser just to finalize
everything and hit submit.</text><text start="439.56" dur="2.31">And they told me it
actually calibrates itself</text><text start="441.87" dur="1.47">over time, this system.</text><text start="443.34" dur="3.06">So every 10 shots, it dials in even more,</text><text start="446.4" dur="1.71">and I actually saw that
happen in real time.</text><text start="448.11" dur="2.22">I watched more shots during
the course of the day.</text><text start="450.33" dur="2.22">Some of the earlier shots
would be just slightly off</text><text start="452.55" dur="2.82">and then some of the shots
later in the day would be fixed</text><text start="455.37" dur="1.23">and they&amp;#39;d be nearly perfect.</text><text start="456.6" dur="1.2">And then there&amp;#39;s actually one more piece</text><text start="457.8" dur="1.2">of tech out there on the golf course</text><text start="459" dur="1.14">that I haven&amp;#39;t even mentioned yet,</text><text start="460.14" dur="2.52">and that is following every
single group of golfers</text><text start="462.66" dur="1.62">as they&amp;#39;re playing in the tournament,</text><text start="464.28" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;ll be able to spot one
person holding a phone.</text><text start="468" dur="1.41">And at this tournament, the travelers,</text><text start="469.41" dur="1.05">they were pretty easy to find</text><text start="470.46" dur="2.13">&amp;#39;cause they were all wearing pink shirts.</text><text start="472.59" dur="2.91">So what are they doing
exactly, you might be asking.</text><text start="475.5" dur="2.73">Well, I got my hands on
exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing.</text><text start="478.23" dur="1.29">Turns out, every single one</text><text start="479.52" dur="1.5">of them is holding the same phone.</text><text start="481.02" dur="3.09">It&amp;#39;s a Samsung Galaxy XCover6,</text><text start="484.11" dur="2.82">a pretty ruggedized phone,
which makes sense for outdoors.</text><text start="486.93" dur="3.15">But what they&amp;#39;re doing is
keeping official scores</text><text start="490.08" dur="1.92">for the online scorecard</text><text start="492" dur="2.85">and their fingerprint is in charge</text><text start="494.85" dur="1.71">of closing the betting windows</text><text start="496.56" dur="3.3">for people who are online
gambling basically in real time</text><text start="499.86" dur="1.47">on specific shots.</text><text start="501.33" dur="3.45">So they literally hold their
fingerprint down on this screen</text><text start="504.78" dur="2.49">until the moment a player
starts their backswing.</text><text start="507.27" dur="2.58">Then they release it to
close the betting window.</text><text start="509.85" dur="2.25">Here you can see them doing exactly that,</text><text start="512.1" dur="3.21">wait for the player to
hit, wait patiently,</text><text start="515.31" dur="1.08">and then there it goes.</text><text start="516.39" dur="1.17">The shot gets hit,</text><text start="517.56" dur="2.25">and then whoever&amp;#39;s betting
on that specific shot,</text><text start="519.81" dur="2.19">whether it&amp;#39;s hitting the
fairway or hitting the green</text><text start="522" dur="2.621">or whatever, that&amp;#39;s the
moment it&amp;#39;s locked in.</text><text start="524.621" dur="2.599">(upbeat music)</text><text start="527.22" dur="2.637">So you remember when the
Vision Pro first came out</text><text start="529.857" dur="3.093">and there were all those mock
ups of all these cool apps</text><text start="532.95" dur="2.67">and experiences that
people wanted to happen?</text><text start="535.62" dur="2.19">I talked about how the ideas
for the apps were ahead</text><text start="537.81" dur="1.26">of the apps themselves.</text><text start="539.07" dur="1.08">One of &amp;#39;em was Formula 1.</text><text start="540.15" dur="2.49">Somebody built this whole
dream F1 watching setup</text><text start="542.64" dur="2.97">with the broadcast up top
and then this little mini map</text><text start="545.61" dur="1.83">of the cars on the track down below.</text><text start="547.44" dur="2.31">It looked so sick, but it
turns out that wasn&amp;#39;t real.</text><text start="549.75" dur="2.514">It was just a mock up that
no one had actually made yet,</text><text start="552.264" dur="4.176">except for the PGA Tour, it turns out,</text><text start="556.44" dur="2.88">because the PGA Tour&amp;#39;s
Apple Vision Pro app,</text><text start="559.32" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s insane, it&amp;#39;s the same
idea and it actually works.</text><text start="562.98" dur="2.19">So they&amp;#39;ve got the leaderboard up top,</text><text start="565.17" dur="2.01">a broadcast feed and some
other things if you want,</text><text start="567.18" dur="2.61">but then at the bottom, in real time,</text><text start="569.79" dur="2.82">you can have a mini map
of any hole on the course</text><text start="572.61" dur="1.74">with an extremely accurate map</text><text start="574.35" dur="2.67">of the hole that&amp;#39;s stitched together from,</text><text start="577.02" dur="4.02">yes, an entire team of drones
that fly over the course</text><text start="581.04" dur="2.7">and map it out a couple of
days before the tournament.</text><text start="583.74" dur="0.87">All right, so once they&amp;#39;ve got</text><text start="584.61" dur="2.46">all the drone footage imported
and stitched it all together,</text><text start="587.07" dur="0.99">this is the result.</text><text start="588.06" dur="1.86">So this is literally on their computer,</text><text start="589.92" dur="3.63">but this is a flyover of,
this is the 10th hole,</text><text start="593.55" dur="1.98">456 yard par four,</text><text start="595.53" dur="3.66">and right away you can
see tons of details.</text><text start="599.19" dur="2.37">There&amp;#39;s all the other
houses on the property,</text><text start="601.56" dur="3.09">there&amp;#39;s all the obvious
things, like the tee boxes</text><text start="604.65" dur="0.833">and the fairway.</text><text start="605.483" dur="2.257">But you see every single tree,</text><text start="607.74" dur="3.21">there&amp;#39;s the iconic tree in
the middle of the fairway.</text><text start="610.95" dur="2.61">You keep going, you can see the cart path,</text><text start="613.56" dur="1.86">you can see where the
hole is on the green.</text><text start="615.42" dur="2.761">You can see even things like the TV tower</text><text start="618.181" dur="3.359">and you flip it around, you
can see where the stands are,</text><text start="621.54" dur="2.25">I&amp;#39;m behind a tree, you can see everything.</text><text start="623.79" dur="3.78">So this is as close of
representation of that hole</text><text start="627.57" dur="2.37">as you can possibly get for all 18 holes.</text><text start="629.94" dur="2.97">And since it&amp;#39;s so detailed,
you can look at the green</text><text start="632.91" dur="1.56">and see how tilted it is.</text><text start="634.47" dur="1.74">This is a pretty flat green,
so there&amp;#39;s not a whole lot</text><text start="636.21" dur="3.09">of elevation change, but
they&amp;#39;ve got these little,</text><text start="639.3" dur="2.4">I mean this looks like
2K, you can see the little</text><text start="641.7" dur="1.95">rolling meters for where it rolls off.</text><text start="643.65" dur="3.93">It&amp;#39;s extremely accurate. So 18 of those.</text><text start="647.58" dur="2.64">So yeah, as this tournament
is actually happening,</text><text start="650.22" dur="1.26">this is what it looks like.</text><text start="651.48" dur="1.44">It&amp;#39;s basically a combination</text><text start="652.92" dur="1.77">of all the technologies we&amp;#39;ve seen</text><text start="654.69" dur="1.23">through this whole experience,</text><text start="655.92" dur="2.04">level one, two, and now three.</text><text start="657.96" dur="2.07">You see the broadcast in all its glory,</text><text start="660.03" dur="3">you see the scoreboard
getting updated in real time,</text><text start="663.03" dur="2.07">and then you have this full overhead view</text><text start="665.1" dur="3.09">of any hole on the course that
you can actually look around</text><text start="668.19" dur="2.88">and watch the shot flying through the air.</text><text start="671.07" dur="2.73">And these are the actual shot shapes.</text><text start="673.8" dur="1.62">Like if a player hits a low shot,</text><text start="675.42" dur="2.31">it will be a low shot in this visual.</text><text start="677.73" dur="2.67">If they hit a draw or
a fade or a high shot,</text><text start="680.4" dur="1.35">it shows all of that too,</text><text start="681.75" dur="2.43">because the launch monitor
knows all of this stuff.</text><text start="684.18" dur="4.14">So this feels like a really futuristic way</text><text start="688.32" dur="0.93">to watch golf.</text><text start="689.25" dur="1.26">I thought it was super cool.</text><text start="690.51" dur="2.4">Now, again, similar to Formula 1,</text><text start="692.91" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re at a new location
every single week</text><text start="695.88" dur="1.14">for every new tournament.</text><text start="697.02" dur="2.94">So it is a massive logistical challenge</text><text start="699.96" dur="1.86">to put all of this stuff</text><text start="701.82" dur="2.19">onto the course and get it all together.</text><text start="704.01" dur="1.83">Matter of fact, just
seeing everything they have</text><text start="705.84" dur="2.85">to bring in from the dozens of trailers</text><text start="708.69" dur="2.94">to the 10 to 20 miles of fiber,</text><text start="711.63" dur="1.8">running all over the golf course,</text><text start="713.43" dur="3.06">to the drone footage,
mapping out every hole,</text><text start="716.49" dur="2.43">and of course, the grandstands
and the scoreboards</text><text start="718.92" dur="1.23">and the TrackMan towers</text><text start="720.15" dur="2.34">and the TV towers all
over the golf course.</text><text start="722.49" dur="2.43">Like they can&amp;#39;t do this for
every single tournament,</text><text start="724.92" dur="1.56">but they do try for as many</text><text start="726.48" dur="3.24">of the larger, high
profile events as possible.</text><text start="729.72" dur="3.93">So it was sick to watch
this event in person</text><text start="733.65" dur="2.67">and then go back and see how
golfers hit certain shots</text><text start="736.32" dur="1.92">and how it looks on the broadcast</text><text start="738.24" dur="1.62">and then in the Vision Pro</text><text start="739.86" dur="1.65">and just to get to see
how it&amp;#39;s represented</text><text start="741.51" dur="1.23">for people who aren&amp;#39;t there.</text><text start="742.74" dur="3.3">Because for every sport, the
broadcast is so important.</text><text start="746.04" dur="1.86">It&amp;#39;s really only 1%</text><text start="747.9" dur="2.25">or less of the people actually watching</text><text start="750.15" dur="2.19">are the ones there in person.</text><text start="752.34" dur="1.77">But basically for everyone else,</text><text start="754.11" dur="2.79">they get to know the sport
through the broadcast,</text><text start="756.9" dur="0.93">through the media,</text><text start="757.83" dur="1.95">and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s so cool about it.</text><text start="759.78" dur="2.31">And that&amp;#39;s always evolving over time.</text><text start="762.09" dur="2.97">I dunno if you remember,
maybe 30 years ago,</text><text start="765.06" dur="3.12">the NHL tried something
interesting with a glowing puck.</text><text start="768.18" dur="1.08">This was like the mid-90s.</text><text start="769.26" dur="1.47">They tried to make it easier for people</text><text start="770.73" dur="3.36">to watch the broadcast and
follow the puck around.</text><text start="774.09" dur="1.02">It was well intentioned,</text><text start="775.11" dur="2.01">but obviously pretty tough execution,</text><text start="777.12" dur="2.67">even though it&amp;#39;s still kind
of cool for 30 years ago.</text><text start="779.79" dur="2.7">Nowadays, the tech is so refined</text><text start="782.49" dur="2.04">and so precise that you can track</text><text start="784.53" dur="2.61">a tiny white ball through the air</text><text start="787.14" dur="2.49">over three football fields at a time</text><text start="789.63" dur="2.67">within a couple yards of margin of error.</text><text start="792.3" dur="2.04">And it is definitely an improvement.</text><text start="794.34" dur="1.26">All this, of course,
at the end of the day,</text><text start="795.6" dur="1.77">is to put on a great show,</text><text start="797.37" dur="1.86">make a great followable broadcast,</text><text start="799.23" dur="1.65">and for the golfers to go out and compete</text><text start="800.88" dur="1.71">and to try to win the tournament,</text><text start="802.59" dur="3.21">and at the end of the
season, to try to win this,</text><text start="805.8" dur="3.003">the FedEx Cup, the precious
end of the year prize.</text><text start="809.7" dur="2.52">And I touched it, I touched
the FedEx Cup. Pretty sick.</text><text start="812.22" dur="1.56">So yeah, shout out again to the PGA Tour</text><text start="813.78" dur="2.37">for making this video possible,
for pulling back the rope,</text><text start="816.15" dur="1.68">and letting us see the behind the scenes.</text><text start="817.83" dur="2.55">Nobody gets to see this
stuff, but now you have.</text><text start="820.38" dur="1.47">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="821.85" dur="1.8">Catch you in the next one.</text><text start="823.65" dur="2.713">Peace.
