<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="1.26">- All right, so imagine this.</text><text start="1.26" dur="3.21">You&amp;#39;re creating a new
startup smartphone company.</text><text start="4.47" dur="2.55">Your goal, of course, is
to make it huge, right?</text><text start="7.02" dur="3.09">So you make your first phone,
you launch with a bang,</text><text start="10.11" dur="1.8">you&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of
enthusiasts on board,</text><text start="11.91" dur="1.86">and you&amp;#39;re slowly starting
to grow this thing.</text><text start="13.77" dur="3.36">And it starts going well
in Europe and in India</text><text start="17.13" dur="1.71">and a few other Asian markets,</text><text start="18.84" dur="2.37">and, you know, things are starting to grow</text><text start="21.21" dur="1.92">and go quite nicely.</text><text start="23.13" dur="2.67">But you notice there&amp;#39;s not a lot of pickup</text><text start="25.8" dur="1.92">in the United States for some reason.</text><text start="27.72" dur="2.55">Now, there&amp;#39;s a few
reasons why this might be.</text><text start="30.27" dur="1.29">I mean, a lot of people already know</text><text start="31.56" dur="2.16">there&amp;#39;s a surprisingly
high amount of people</text><text start="33.72" dur="2.07">who just walk into a carrier store</text><text start="35.79" dur="1.32">to buy their phones in the US,</text><text start="37.11" dur="2.79">so if you don&amp;#39;t have
a deal with a carrier,</text><text start="39.9" dur="2.43">then things might not
go well for you there.</text><text start="42.33" dur="2.25">And this is a enthusiast-only thing.</text><text start="44.58" dur="3.09">They&amp;#39;re selling them online,
so that&amp;#39;s understandable.</text><text start="47.67" dur="3.06">But then you get to the stats,</text><text start="50.73" dur="2.16">and the stats say the iPhone</text><text start="52.89" dur="3.96">has somewhere around 50%
market share in the US,</text><text start="56.85" dur="1.56">which is higher than the global average,</text><text start="58.41" dur="3.51">and it is steadily
growing every single year.</text><text start="61.92" dur="4.32">And worst of all, 87%, that&amp;#39;s not a typo,</text><text start="66.24" dur="3.69">87% of teenagers in the US have an iPhone.</text><text start="69.93" dur="4.08">And that honestly feels
like the most damning one</text><text start="74.01" dur="2.13">because that means they got them early.</text><text start="76.14" dur="1.8">Like, everyone knows about the walls</text><text start="77.94" dur="1.77">Apple builds up around their ecosystem</text><text start="79.71" dur="3.63">to try to keep people in
the iPhone walled garden.</text><text start="83.34" dur="3.12">But 87% of teenagers, that just means</text><text start="86.46" dur="1.98">that this is a lot of these
people&amp;#39;s first phones.</text><text start="88.44" dur="3.42">These people will be iPhone
customers for life maybe.</text><text start="91.86" dur="2.52">Like, for a lot of them, their
friends all have iPhones,</text><text start="94.38" dur="2.01">and if they&amp;#39;re gonna get their first phone</text><text start="96.39" dur="0.833">for the first time,</text><text start="97.223" dur="2.167">they don&amp;#39;t really even consider anything</text><text start="99.39" dur="1.89">that isn&amp;#39;t also an iPhone.</text><text start="101.28" dur="1.5">It&amp;#39;s the only way to get
into all the group chats</text><text start="102.78" dur="0.833">with their friends.</text><text start="103.613" dur="1.957">It&amp;#39;s the only way to get
in on all the inside jokes</text><text start="105.57" dur="2.61">and socializations that
happen after school</text><text start="108.18" dur="2.19">from the FaceTimes to the iMessages</text><text start="110.37" dur="1.95">and all the things that
are just iPhone only.</text><text start="112.32" dur="2.61">So it&amp;#39;s a very baked-in thing.</text><text start="114.93" dur="3">It&amp;#39;s a very US-centric thing for sure,</text><text start="117.93" dur="1.08">but it is everywhere.</text><text start="119.01" dur="1.2">So this is why, when I made</text><text start="120.21" dur="2.82">that &amp;quot;Blue Bubbles vs. Green
Bubbles: Explained!&amp;quot; video,</text><text start="123.03" dur="1.65">I had to put that disclaimer
in the beginning of the video,</text><text start="124.68" dur="1.777">but that&amp;#39;s why half
the comments were like,</text><text start="126.457" dur="2.573">&amp;quot;Yeah, I live in the US,
and I see this everywhere.</text><text start="129.03" dur="1.35">There&amp;#39;s iPhones everywhere,</text><text start="130.38" dur="2.7">and the pressure of the
iPhone is very real.&amp;quot;</text><text start="133.08" dur="2.407">And then the other half
of the comments are like,</text><text start="135.487" dur="2.543">&amp;quot;This is the dumbest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever seen.</text><text start="138.03" dur="2.82">Why do people care so much
about which phone people use?</text><text start="140.85" dur="2.94">Just use WhatsApp. It&amp;#39;s super easy.&amp;quot;</text><text start="143.79" dur="1.68">And so that&amp;#39;s why that dichotomy exists.</text><text start="145.47" dur="0.84">But, you know, you get the idea.</text><text start="146.31" dur="1.86">So you are that smartphone company.</text><text start="148.17" dur="1.26">You&amp;#39;re in this position.</text><text start="149.43" dur="2.1">You&amp;#39;re trying to break out in the US.</text><text start="151.53" dur="0.993">What do you do?</text><text start="153.39" dur="1.14">It&amp;#39;s a real question,</text><text start="154.53" dur="2.64">and as some of you may have picked up</text><text start="157.17" dur="2.1">by the title and premise of this video,</text><text start="159.27" dur="1.65">it&amp;#39;s a real company too.</text><text start="160.92" dur="0.9">It&amp;#39;s Nothing.</text><text start="161.82" dur="2.79">This is a company that&amp;#39;s made
their first two phones now,</text><text start="164.61" dur="2.25">they&amp;#39;ve got some accessories,
they&amp;#39;re trying to break out,</text><text start="166.86" dur="5">and their options seem to
be just give up on the US</text><text start="172.2" dur="2.49">or maybe try to strike a carrier
deal and get in that way,</text><text start="174.69" dur="2.19">but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it might work,</text><text start="176.88" dur="3.78">or just lean all the way in</text><text start="180.66" dur="3.3">and embrace the actual
heart of the question,</text><text start="183.96" dur="4.11">the number one problem, the
biggest asset of the other side.</text><text start="188.07" dur="1.14">And that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing.</text><text start="189.21" dur="1.62">So what Nothing has decided to do,</text><text start="190.83" dur="1.62">and they&amp;#39;re announcing this today,</text><text start="192.45" dur="5">is they have built iMessage
into their Android phone,</text><text start="200.55" dur="0.833">kind of.</text><text start="201.383" dur="2.317">So they&amp;#39;ve announced a new
app that is gonna come out</text><text start="203.7" dur="4.02">and be exclusive to the
Nothing Phone 2 to start,</text><text start="207.72" dur="2.64">and it&amp;#39;s called the Nothing Chats app.</text><text start="210.36" dur="4.02">And their goal with this is
to literally offer iMessage</text><text start="214.38" dur="2.28">also on their phone.</text><text start="216.66" dur="2.19">Now, how does this work,
you might be asking?</text><text start="218.85" dur="1.14">Great question. Glad you asked.</text><text start="219.99" dur="0.833">So I&amp;#39;ve got it here.</text><text start="220.823" dur="1.267">This is an app that&amp;#39;s co-developed</text><text start="222.09" dur="1.56">with a company called Sunbird</text><text start="223.65" dur="1.38">who has been doing this for a little while</text><text start="225.03" dur="1.56">in a restricted beta.</text><text start="226.59" dur="0.96">You might&amp;#39;ve heard of it,</text><text start="227.55" dur="1.17">and there&amp;#39;s also a couple of others</text><text start="228.72" dur="1.44">floating around like this.</text><text start="230.16" dur="0.833">And basically what it does</text><text start="230.993" dur="2.737">is it lets you sign into
it using an Apple ID.</text><text start="233.73" dur="1.77">So you can just sign
up for an Apple account</text><text start="235.5" dur="1.26">without any Apple products.</text><text start="236.76" dur="2.91">You sign up for an Apple ID,
and then you sign into the app,</text><text start="239.67" dur="3.51">and it will give you as many
iMessage features as possible</text><text start="243.18" dur="1.86">without actually having an iPhone.</text><text start="245.04" dur="2.37">So, okay, a couple of things about this.</text><text start="247.41" dur="3.6">One, this Nothing Chats
app, when you first sign in,</text><text start="251.01" dur="1.47">is pretty intuitive.</text><text start="252.48" dur="3.12">You go through the setup process
to create a Nothing account</text><text start="255.6" dur="2.34">and then connect your Apple ID.</text><text start="257.94" dur="1.95">So, like I said, you can make an Apple ID</text><text start="259.89" dur="2.28">even if you have no Apple products,</text><text start="262.17" dur="1.2">and then you sign in,</text><text start="263.37" dur="2.19">and then everything
just seems to work fine.</text><text start="265.56" dur="3.45">It&amp;#39;s more or less looking
exactly like a skinned version</text><text start="269.01" dur="1.77">of the Sunbird beta app.</text><text start="270.78" dur="2.82">And so sure enough, when
you go to message an iPhone</text><text start="273.6" dur="3.24">or join any group chat that
has a bunch of iPhones in it,</text><text start="276.84" dur="3.18">things that would not work
with an Android phone before,</text><text start="280.02" dur="1.05">it basically starts off</text><text start="281.07" dur="2.01">by sending through a virtual contact card</text><text start="283.08" dur="1.98">asking to merge your contact info</text><text start="285.06" dur="1.86">with your Apple ID email address,</text><text start="286.92" dur="1.71">and then suddenly it all works,</text><text start="288.63" dur="1.08">and you&amp;#39;re a blue bubble,</text><text start="289.71" dur="1.83">and you&amp;#39;re texting people with iMessage</text><text start="291.54" dur="1.92">from your Android phone.</text><text start="293.46" dur="2.31">Also, high-quality media is working.</text><text start="295.77" dur="1.2">So you might have heard
of this issue already.</text><text start="296.97" dur="1.77">This is actually one of
my biggest annoyances,</text><text start="298.74" dur="1.32">but when you message an iPhone</text><text start="300.06" dur="2.25">with an Android phone or vice versa,</text><text start="302.31" dur="1.62">and you send, like, a video or a photo,</text><text start="303.93" dur="1.05">it&amp;#39;s, like, super blurry</text><text start="304.98" dur="2.7">because it&amp;#39;s been compressed a lot</text><text start="307.68" dur="2.25">to fit in the file size limits of MMS.</text><text start="309.93" dur="1.23">But now you actually get</text><text start="311.16" dur="2.19">that full-resolution
photo and video treatment</text><text start="313.35" dur="2.37">as if you&amp;#39;re just two iPhones
talking to each other,</text><text start="315.72" dur="2.31">which is actually very convenient.</text><text start="318.03" dur="1.41">Typing indicators work</text><text start="319.44" dur="2.07">when another person has
been typing for a while,</text><text start="321.51" dur="1.71">and they&amp;#39;re also working
on the reactions as well.</text><text start="323.22" dur="1.59">It&amp;#39;s not in this beta
that I&amp;#39;ve been testing,</text><text start="324.81" dur="1.26">but they say they&amp;#39;re gonna have that</text><text start="326.07" dur="1.44">around the end of this year.</text><text start="327.51" dur="0.833">But then number two,</text><text start="328.343" dur="1.537">they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re launching this</text><text start="329.88" dur="3.48">as an exclusive app for
the Nothing Phone 2,</text><text start="333.36" dur="1.41">so just this phone,</text><text start="334.77" dur="2.88">and I imagine future
Nothing phones as well,</text><text start="337.65" dur="2.76">to sort of give people that option</text><text start="340.41" dur="1.89">where if they were gonna buy a new phone,</text><text start="342.3" dur="3.33">and they really wanna be
in the iMessage group chats</text><text start="345.63" dur="1.8">and all the iMessage features,</text><text start="347.43" dur="1.53">and they could only buy an iPhone,</text><text start="348.96" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;ll at least also have
this phone as an option.</text><text start="352.65" dur="1.92">But then three, this is the big one,</text><text start="354.57" dur="2.97">and I cannot stress this enough,</text><text start="357.54" dur="4.62">this could lead to
enormous security issues.</text><text start="362.16" dur="2.25">Signing in with your Apple ID</text><text start="364.41" dur="3.06">onto a device that you don&amp;#39;t own</text><text start="367.47" dur="1.89">is an enormous security issue,</text><text start="369.36" dur="1.74">and it&amp;#39;s a huge risk to anyone using it.</text><text start="371.1" dur="2.22">Same thing is also true
about Beeper and the others.</text><text start="373.32" dur="1.05">Because the way this one works,</text><text start="374.37" dur="1.38">and I&amp;#39;ve confirmed this with Nothing,</text><text start="375.75" dur="3">is when you sign in with an Apple ID,</text><text start="378.75" dur="3.21">it&amp;#39;s literally signing in on some Mac Mini</text><text start="381.96" dur="1.8">in a server farm somewhere,</text><text start="383.76" dur="2.4">and that Mac Mini will then
do all of the routing for you</text><text start="386.16" dur="1.53">to make this happen.</text><text start="387.69" dur="4.11">You will never see or actually
hold or use that Mac Mini.</text><text start="391.8" dur="4.05">Now, no one else is
supposed to be able to use</text><text start="395.85" dur="3.06">or see that Mac Mini
or your messages on it</text><text start="398.91" dur="1.74">because it&amp;#39;s all encrypted,</text><text start="400.65" dur="3.12">but you are still logging
in with your own Apple ID</text><text start="403.77" dur="1.05">on someone else&amp;#39;s computer.</text><text start="404.82" dur="1.14">I don&amp;#39;t know how else to put that.</text><text start="405.96" dur="2.82">Like, that on its face
is a big enough risk</text><text start="408.78" dur="1.86">that many people will
never even wanna try this.</text><text start="410.64" dur="1.83">But hey, if you&amp;#39;re Nothing,</text><text start="412.47" dur="3.277">well, maybe this is just
enough to be able to say,</text><text start="415.747" dur="3.443">&amp;quot;Hey, we&amp;#39;re offering iMessage
on an Android phone.&amp;quot;</text><text start="419.19" dur="2.16">Like, this is a young
and crazy enough company</text><text start="421.35" dur="2.46">that they&amp;#39;re gonna try stuff like this,</text><text start="423.81" dur="2.91">so maybe people will consider
a Nothing phone in the US</text><text start="426.72" dur="1.23">instead of an iPhone</text><text start="427.95" dur="2.13">that everyone seems to
just choose by default.</text><text start="430.08" dur="2.16">I actually talked to Nothing about this</text><text start="432.24" dur="2.19">as I was testing it before
this is all going live,</text><text start="434.43" dur="2.317">and I actually asked Carl Pei straight up,</text><text start="436.747" dur="5">&amp;quot;What do you think Apple is
going to do or say about this</text><text start="441.78" dur="1.59">once they find out about it?&amp;quot;</text><text start="443.37" dur="2.46">Because as this video goes live,</text><text start="445.83" dur="2.22">Apple&amp;#39;s finding out about this.</text><text start="448.05" dur="5">And his answer was,
&amp;quot;Honestly, probably nothing.&amp;quot;</text><text start="453.15" dur="1.83">But just because there&amp;#39;s a weird timeline</text><text start="454.98" dur="1.98">we&amp;#39;re living in here in 2023</text><text start="456.96" dur="2.79">where Apple kind of can&amp;#39;t
really retaliate publicly</text><text start="459.75" dur="1.53">because they&amp;#39;ve already been up</text><text start="461.28" dur="2.4">against so much antitrust pressure.</text><text start="463.68" dur="2.55">Everyone already knows
Apple is using iMessage</text><text start="466.23" dur="2.79">and its powers to keep people
from leaving the iPhone,</text><text start="469.02" dur="2.37">but if Apple now, like,
publicly acknowledges this</text><text start="471.39" dur="1.53">as a competitor in the space</text><text start="472.92" dur="2.25">that they&amp;#39;ve gotta shut
down or something like that,</text><text start="475.17" dur="1.29">it could sort of shine a light on it</text><text start="476.46" dur="1.863">in a way they don&amp;#39;t actually want,</text><text start="479.37" dur="2.97">so they&amp;#39;ll probably just
quietly sweep it under the rug</text><text start="482.34" dur="3.3">and maybe just point
out some security risks</text><text start="485.64" dur="1.14">involved with the whole thing.</text><text start="486.78" dur="1.41">But then, of course, the
other side of the coin</text><text start="488.19" dur="2.19">is if Apple cares so much about security,</text><text start="490.38" dur="1.65">then wouldn&amp;#39;t they wanna support RCS</text><text start="492.03" dur="2.46">so that the millions of
messages that go back and forth</text><text start="494.49" dur="2.46">between Android phones
and iPhones every day</text><text start="496.95" dur="2.67">won&amp;#39;t be unencrypted SMS?</text><text start="499.62" dur="3.03">But that&amp;#39;s another story for another day.</text><text start="502.65" dur="1.68">But at the end of the
day, the real question is,</text><text start="504.33" dur="1.41">will it work?</text><text start="505.74" dur="4.26">Will this strategy of
offering some iMessage stuff</text><text start="510" dur="2.01">on their phone exclusively</text><text start="512.01" dur="3.24">actually work for Nothing
to break out in the US?</text><text start="515.25" dur="3.45">And the fact is there&amp;#39;s a
non-zero number of people</text><text start="518.7" dur="1.89">who will be willing to try this,</text><text start="520.59" dur="3.36">to give themselves the
iMessage, the blue bubble life</text><text start="523.95" dur="2.1">while still using a different phone.</text><text start="526.05" dur="1.117">There&amp;#39;s probably somebody
out there who&amp;#39;s like,</text><text start="527.167" dur="1.313">&amp;quot;I might buy a Nothing phone,</text><text start="528.48" dur="2.67">but, also, all my friends have
iPhones, so I guess I can&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;</text><text start="531.15" dur="3.09">And for them, this is real, it&amp;#39;s great,</text><text start="534.24" dur="2.25">but there&amp;#39;s a lot of baggage with that,</text><text start="536.49" dur="3.03">and it&amp;#39;s sort of a weird
timeline we&amp;#39;re living in now</text><text start="539.52" dur="2.64">that this is actually a possible
thing that could happen.</text><text start="542.16" dur="1.29">Let me know what your thoughts are</text><text start="543.45" dur="1.26">in the comment section below,</text><text start="544.71" dur="1.8">if you think this will work.</text><text start="546.51" dur="1.5">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="548.01" dur="2.186">Catch you guys in the next one.
