iPod with touch controls,</text><text start="3.109" dur="2.146">a revolutionary mobile phone,</text><text start="5.255" dur="4.065">and a breakthrough internet
communications device.</text><text start="9.32" dur="2.333">(energetic music)</text><text start="11.653" dur="2.017">(phone vibrating)</text><text start="13.67" dur="3.04">Profound new intelligence capabilities</text><text start="16.71" dur="2.643">that will make our platforms even smarter.</text><text start="21" dur="2.087">- So this is the iPhone 16,</text><text start="23.087" dur="2.263">and this is the iPhone 16 Pro.</text><text start="25.35" dur="1.53">Brand new, and I&amp;#39;ve been testing them</text><text start="26.88" dur="1.44">for about two weeks now.</text><text start="28.32" dur="2.46">But you know what I&amp;#39;ve been
doing way longer than two weeks?</text><text start="30.78" dur="3.93">Working on a new app that
we are finally launching.</text><text start="34.71" dur="1.17">You guys have always been asking me</text><text start="35.88" dur="1.29">where I get my wallpapers.</text><text start="37.17" dur="2.25">Like, it&amp;#39;s frequently the number
one suggested search result</text><text start="39.42" dur="2.1">under my name, has been for years.</text><text start="41.52" dur="2.37">So now we&amp;#39;ve put them all in one place.</text><text start="43.89" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s called Panels.</text><text start="45.57" dur="1.86">And it&amp;#39;s finally live in the App Store,</text><text start="47.43" dur="2.43">both on iOS and on Android.</text><text start="49.86" dur="1.5">Feels really good to be able to say that.</text><text start="51.36" dur="2.31">So if you&amp;#39;re wondering where
the wallpaper on these phones</text><text start="53.67" dur="1.83">in the review came from, Panels.</text><text start="55.5" dur="1.05">If you&amp;#39;re wondering where the wallpaper</text><text start="56.55" dur="2.28">in the last video came from, Panels.</text><text start="58.83" dur="2.73">Matter of fact, almost all of
the wallpapers on the devices</text><text start="61.56" dur="2.01">and in backgrounds
you&amp;#39;ve seen in my videos</text><text start="63.57" dur="3.15">for the past year have
all come from Panels,</text><text start="66.72" dur="0.833">which is pretty sick.</text><text start="67.553" dur="1.597">We have a bunch of
awesome artists over there</text><text start="69.15" dur="2.04">that we are splitting profits with 50-50.</text><text start="71.19" dur="3.21">And there&amp;#39;s already a ton
of great collections of art</text><text start="74.4" dur="1.53">and much more incoming.</text><text start="75.93" dur="1.74">And we have some pretty
big plans for this thing.</text><text start="77.67" dur="3.87">So it&amp;#39;s starting off
as a wallpaper app now.</text><text start="81.54" dur="2.19">I don&amp;#39;t want to over promise too much,</text><text start="83.73" dur="2.76">but it&amp;#39;s going to be pretty
consistently improving</text><text start="86.49" dur="1.35">over time, which is part of the reason why</text><text start="87.84" dur="1.53">we&amp;#39;re offering a
subscription to support it.</text><text start="89.37" dur="0.99">So go pick it up now.</text><text start="90.36" dur="2.73">Poke around, find your
new favorite wallpaper,</text><text start="93.09" dur="2.85">your new favorite artist, and
lemme know what you think.</text><text start="95.94" dur="1.86">It&amp;#39;s kind of fun to be
on the other side now,</text><text start="97.8" dur="1.11">on the development side,</text><text start="98.91" dur="3.45">where now other people are
gonna review what we make,</text><text start="102.36" dur="1.89">which is always exciting.</text><text start="104.25" dur="4.08">Anyway, so the meta with
new smartphones these days</text><text start="108.33" dur="3.33">is a bunch of incremental
hardware improvements</text><text start="111.66" dur="2.55">and then a whole bunch of AI features</text><text start="114.21" dur="2.01">that also are being added on top,</text><text start="116.22" dur="1.26">which is where the real value is.</text><text start="117.48" dur="1.41">And while they&amp;#39;re a
little late to the game,</text><text start="118.89" dur="2.58">Apple has hit that chapter
too with the iPhone,</text><text start="121.47" dur="1.14">whether we like it or not.</text><text start="122.61" dur="4.98">So the iPhone 16 is a minor,
minor update over the 15,</text><text start="127.59" dur="4.47">but with a ton of new AI stuff
labeled Apple Intelligence.</text><text start="132.06" dur="3.96">Except that stuff&amp;#39;s not here
yet, which is a little awkward</text><text start="136.02" dur="2.82">considering basically all of
the marketing for this phone</text><text start="138.84" dur="1.26">is Apple Intelligence stuff.</text><text start="140.1" dur="1.92">Like, I&amp;#39;ve seen billboards touting that</text><text start="142.02" dur="1.89">as the new thing here.</text><text start="143.91" dur="2.37">Their whole event was
about how it&amp;#39;s Glowtime,</text><text start="146.28" dur="2.43">which is a reference to the
new glowing Siri animation.</text><text start="148.71" dur="3.93">But none of that stuff is
on this phone, none of it.</text><text start="152.64" dur="4.29">So the only way to square the
state of this phone right now</text><text start="156.93" dur="3.401">with everything Apple
has said about this phone</text><text start="160.331" dur="3.079">is that it&amp;#39;s unfinished.</text><text start="163.41" dur="1.32">Like, this is the most unfinished</text><text start="164.73" dur="2.13">I&amp;#39;ve ever seen a new iPhone launch.</text><text start="166.86" dur="2.25">So until we actually have all
that Apple Intelligence stuff,</text><text start="169.11" dur="4.093">we are left with a very
incremental upgrade cycle.</text><text start="173.203" dur="2.75">(cheerful music)</text><text start="180.57" dur="2.7">So there&amp;#39;s not a lot
actually physically new</text><text start="183.27" dur="2.76">with this year&amp;#39;s iPhone,
but it&amp;#39;s not nothing.</text><text start="186.03" dur="1.74">So the iPhone 16 looks a little different</text><text start="187.77" dur="1.02">from the iPhone 15.</text><text start="188.79" dur="2.16">There was a moment in
time not that long ago</text><text start="190.95" dur="1.68">where Apple removed the headphone jack,</text><text start="192.63" dur="1.17">and then there was a ton of speculation</text><text start="193.8" dur="3.09">about them maybe removing all
the ports and all the buttons.</text><text start="196.89" dur="1.8">But instead it&amp;#39;s gone the opposite way</text><text start="198.69" dur="3.06">and they&amp;#39;ve added the action
button from last year&amp;#39;s Pros</text><text start="201.75" dur="2.67">and yet another button
called Camera Control,</text><text start="204.42" dur="2.1">which we&amp;#39;ll get to in a second.</text><text start="206.52" dur="0.833">Aesthetically, though,</text><text start="207.353" dur="1.507">there are some really poppy new colors</text><text start="208.86" dur="2.1">and slightly larger protruding cameras</text><text start="210.96" dur="1.92">lined up on the back of the phone.</text><text start="212.88" dur="2.49">And, okay, I know everyone
puts a case on their phone,</text><text start="215.37" dur="1.14">so this is probably nothing,</text><text start="216.51" dur="3.06">but I think this is the
wobbliest slab phone</text><text start="219.57" dur="2.58">I have ever seen, or at
least that I can remember.</text><text start="222.15" dur="2.88">But either way, the rest of the
general shape and flat sides</text><text start="225.03" dur="2.61">and dimensions of this phone
are basically the same.</text><text start="227.64" dur="2.46">It&amp;#39;s very familiar iPhone.</text><text start="230.1" dur="2.61">The Pro phones are even
harder to tell apart,</text><text start="232.71" dur="2.52">but they do have new
displays and they&amp;#39;re great.</text><text start="235.23" dur="4.95">So they&amp;#39;re slightly bigger, 6.3
and 6.9 inches respectively.</text><text start="240.18" dur="2.97">And the bezels are, I think,
actually noticeably thinner</text><text start="243.15" dur="1.56">and still even all the way around.</text><text start="244.71" dur="3.6">So both sized phones are just
a little larger than last year</text><text start="248.31" dur="1.38">and fit bigger batteries too.</text><text start="249.69" dur="1.35">And we should talk about batteries.</text><text start="251.04" dur="1.89">So when Apple unveiled
all these new phones,</text><text start="252.93" dur="1.77">they made kind of a big deal</text><text start="254.7" dur="2.864">about how they all have slightly
larger capacity batteries</text><text start="257.564" dur="2.596">across the board, and that the new Pro Max</text><text start="260.16" dur="3.57">would have the longest battery
life ever in an iPhone.</text><text start="263.73" dur="4.223">Which I mean, I would hope that
your newest, most expensive,</text><text start="267.953" dur="3.607">most high tech, biggest phone
ever has the longest battery,</text><text start="271.56" dur="2.76">but still, they didn&amp;#39;t give
any numbers to support that.</text><text start="274.32" dur="0.96">So we don&amp;#39;t actually know</text><text start="275.28" dur="2.52">how much larger in
milliamp-hours the battery is</text><text start="277.8" dur="2.88">or how much longer the
battery actually lasts.</text><text start="280.68" dur="3.93">All I have to go on is Apple&amp;#39;s
website&amp;#39;s comparison tool,</text><text start="284.61" dur="2.91">which only measures in
video playback hours.</text><text start="287.52" dur="3.75">So it has the iPhone 16 at
22 hours of video playback</text><text start="291.27" dur="4.68">up from 20, and the 16 Pro Max
is all the way up to 33 hours</text><text start="295.95" dur="2.31">versus last year&amp;#39;s big phone&amp;#39;s 29.</text><text start="298.26" dur="3.09">Unfortunately, this means
almost nothing to me</text><text start="301.35" dur="2.55">because video playback can be optimized</text><text start="303.9" dur="1.29">with like, cores on a chip.</text><text start="305.19" dur="0.833">Who cares?</text><text start="306.023" dur="2.887">But now the phones are out
and people have gotten them</text><text start="308.91" dur="1.35">and torn &amp;#39;em apart, measured &amp;#39;em.</text><text start="310.26" dur="3.48">Turns out the batteries are
about 6% larger across the board</text><text start="313.74" dur="1.838">and 9% larger on the Pro.</text><text start="315.578" dur="4.132">And I&amp;#39;ve found battery life
about the same as last year,</text><text start="319.71" dur="0.833">to be honest.</text><text start="320.543" dur="2.96">Like, not noticeably better,
not noticeably worse.</text><text start="323.503" dur="2.297">I end up saying a lot of
the same things about it,</text><text start="325.8" dur="2.13">like it lasts me a whole day on the Pro,</text><text start="327.93" dur="2.37">heavy use, no problem.</text><text start="330.3" dur="2.16">What actually did make a
difference to me, though,</text><text start="332.46" dur="1.17">is faster charging.</text><text start="333.63" dur="1.17">Less people are talking about it,</text><text start="334.8" dur="1.92">but all of the new iPhone 16 lineup</text><text start="336.72" dur="3.75">supports up to 45 watt wired charging now.</text><text start="340.47" dur="1.515">Apple never talks about fast charging,</text><text start="341.985" dur="1.665">they never brag about like,</text><text start="343.65" dur="4.08">how fast you can go 0%
to 100% or 0% to 80%,</text><text start="347.73" dur="3.06">but when their phones do get
slightly faster at charging,</text><text start="350.79" dur="0.833">it&amp;#39;s pretty nice.</text><text start="351.623" dur="1.927">It&amp;#39;s too bad it doesn&amp;#39;t come
with a fast charging brick</text><text start="353.55" dur="0.833">in the box.</text><text start="354.383" dur="0.877">But I have a fast charger.</text><text start="355.26" dur="2.01">I am loving the new
fast charging in bursts.</text><text start="357.27" dur="2.73">And also MagSafe supports,
with the new puck,</text><text start="360" dur="2.85">up to 25 watt wireless
charging instead of 15.</text><text start="362.85" dur="4.92">On the inside, these phones
have the A18 and A18 Pro chips.</text><text start="367.77" dur="1.8">And again, I&amp;#39;d be lying if I told you</text><text start="369.57" dur="2.61">I just noticed any
difference right out the box</text><text start="372.18" dur="1.71">and I think basically anybody would.</text><text start="373.89" dur="3.42">But yes, they will benchmark
10%, 20%, 30% faster</text><text start="377.31" dur="1.95">depending on what you ask it to do.</text><text start="379.26" dur="1.38">But the extra power is definitely</text><text start="380.64" dur="1.59">more about fringe activities,</text><text start="382.23" dur="1.98">high-end stuff, future-proofing.</text><text start="384.21" dur="1.11">I was actually more curious, though,</text><text start="385.32" dur="3.6">to find that all of the models
have eight gigs of RAM now.</text><text start="388.92" dur="2.28">So the Pro phones and the non-Pro phones,</text><text start="391.2" dur="2.13">which usually have different amounts.</text><text start="393.33" dur="2.37">No doubt this is because the
Apple Intelligence features,</text><text start="395.7" dur="1.08">when they eventually ship,</text><text start="396.78" dur="1.92">are going to need every last bit of it.</text><text start="398.7" dur="2.61">But for now, hey, you can enjoy more RAM</text><text start="401.31" dur="1.29">for all your other apps too.</text><text start="402.6" dur="2.58">IOS 18 launched with these new phones too.</text><text start="405.18" dur="3.93">So I made an entire
separate video about iOS 18,</text><text start="409.11" dur="1.26">all the new features.</text><text start="410.37" dur="0.84">That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s rolling out</text><text start="411.21" dur="1.95">to everybody&amp;#39;s older
iPhones as well now too.</text><text start="413.16" dur="3.03">So you can put your home
screen icons wherever,</text><text start="416.19" dur="2.1">you can color your home screen icons,</text><text start="418.29" dur="1.95">you can change your lock screen shortcuts,</text><text start="420.24" dur="3.87">basically customize the iPhone
a bit more than ever before.</text><text start="424.11" dur="3.15">You could argue this makes a
bigger difference to the iPhone</text><text start="427.26" dur="2.16">than any of the other hardware stuff.</text><text start="429.42" dur="2.01">But yeah, I&amp;#39;ll link that full video below.</text><text start="431.43" dur="4.68">But speaking of new hardware,
there is one other new button.</text><text start="436.11" dur="2.833">(energetic music)</text><text start="442.14" dur="2.34">So I guess nobody at Apple is
allowed to call it a button,</text><text start="444.48" dur="1.59">but I&amp;#39;m gonna call it a button.</text><text start="446.07" dur="2.49">So this is the new Camera Control button</text><text start="448.56" dur="1.8">on all of the new iPhone 16&amp;#39;s.</text><text start="450.36" dur="1.56">I&amp;#39;ve used and played with</text><text start="451.92" dur="1.95">and thought a lot about this button.</text><text start="453.87" dur="1.8">And actually, it all comes down to</text><text start="455.67" dur="2.88">smartphone cameras in general.</text><text start="458.55" dur="5">My take is that smartphone
cameras are like headphones&amp;#39; EQ.</text><text start="463.62" dur="1.59">Like, you get a new pair
of headphones out the box</text><text start="465.21" dur="1.59">and you listen to &amp;#39;em, you don&amp;#39;t like &amp;#39;em,</text><text start="466.8" dur="1.02">oh no, no, don&amp;#39;t worry.</text><text start="467.82" dur="2.94">That&amp;#39;s just one of the ways
that these headphones can sound.</text><text start="470.76" dur="1.5">You can change the EQ</text><text start="472.26" dur="2.424">and it&amp;#39;ll sound like a totally
different pair of headphones.</text><text start="474.684" dur="3.336">And that&amp;#39;s also true
with smartphone cameras,</text><text start="478.02" dur="1.86">this year more than ever with the iPhone.</text><text start="479.88" dur="2.04">So the default photos from the iPhone</text><text start="481.92" dur="2.46">look more iPhoney than ever.</text><text start="484.38" dur="1.95">Remember how every year in the
blind smartphone camera test</text><text start="486.33" dur="0.9">the iPhone loses</text><text start="487.23" dur="2.85">because it kind of overly
brightens all the shadows</text><text start="490.08" dur="1.706">and it doesn&amp;#39;t have as much contrast?</text><text start="491.786" dur="1.414">Yeah, it&amp;#39;s still doing that,</text><text start="493.2" dur="1.98">especially in photos with people in it.</text><text start="495.18" dur="3.81">But the purpose of this new
button has been made very clear</text><text start="498.99" dur="2.34">and it&amp;#39;s kind of a theme
for the whole phone,</text><text start="501.33" dur="2.34">which is, well, camera control.</text><text start="503.67" dur="2.73">This year, Apple&amp;#39;s kind
of just giving back</text><text start="506.4" dur="4.17">control of the camera to
users in an interesting way.</text><text start="510.57" dur="1.8">But you have to know how to use it.</text><text start="512.37" dur="2.67">Like, you have to know that
it&amp;#39;s a double half press</text><text start="515.04" dur="1.2">with just the right weight</text><text start="516.24" dur="2.46">to bring up the sliding
menu of camera controls</text><text start="518.7" dur="2.25">for things like exposure compensation</text><text start="520.95" dur="2.91">and zoom and photographic styles and tone.</text><text start="523.86" dur="2.4">And then play with it enough to realize</text><text start="526.26" dur="3.18">that tone is actually maybe
the most important one,</text><text start="529.44" dur="3.12">where turning up tone actually
removes shadows even more</text><text start="532.56" dur="3.27">but turning down tone
brings real shadows back.</text><text start="535.83" dur="1.59">But it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have a memory,</text><text start="537.42" dur="1.29">so you have to remember to set it</text><text start="538.71" dur="1.77">every time you open the camera app.</text><text start="540.48" dur="1.92">But you also have this D-pad</text><text start="542.4" dur="2.73">that lets you change even
more elements of a photo,</text><text start="545.13" dur="3.24">including undertones and mood and color</text><text start="548.37" dur="1.14">and really mess around</text><text start="549.51" dur="2.04">and dial in the look
of the photos you want.</text><text start="551.55" dur="2.07">And this one does have memory,</text><text start="553.62" dur="1.92">so every subsequent
time you open the camera</text><text start="555.54" dur="2.04">it&amp;#39;ll remember your color hue and tone.</text><text start="557.58" dur="5">So I found that tone at
around -0.5 is a nice balance</text><text start="562.71" dur="1.38">for most photos that I&amp;#39;ve been taking.</text><text start="564.09" dur="1.77">Feels less flat, more contrasty.</text><text start="565.86" dur="2.1">This is all really useful to me.</text><text start="567.96" dur="3.03">And combined with the actual
new cameras on the phones,</text><text start="570.99" dur="2.94">this has risen the iPhone back to the top</text><text start="573.93" dur="1.89">of my personal favorite rankings</text><text start="575.82" dur="1.35">of smartphones to shoot with.</text><text start="577.17" dur="3.9">I just like having more
control over the camera.</text><text start="581.07" dur="1.11">Camera control.</text><text start="582.18" dur="3.15">But it is really finicky.</text><text start="585.33" dur="3.18">Like, the placement on the side
of the phone for the button</text><text start="588.51" dur="1.95">is mostly ideal for landscape,</text><text start="590.46" dur="1.62">but would definitely be easier to reach</text><text start="592.08" dur="1.23">if it was closer to the corner.</text><text start="593.31" dur="0.833">But if we&amp;#39;re being honest,</text><text start="594.143" dur="2.887">most people take photos and
videos in portrait these days</text><text start="597.03" dur="1.83">and the corner would be
horrible for portrait,</text><text start="598.86" dur="2.16">so they split the difference
and moved it up a bit</text><text start="601.02" dur="0.985">so you could reach it.</text><text start="602.005" dur="2.345">But it&amp;#39;s still not great.</text><text start="604.35" dur="2.37">And the half press
sensitivity takes some time</text><text start="606.72" dur="1.23">to really get used to.</text><text start="607.95" dur="1.14">I&amp;#39;m on week three now,</text><text start="609.09" dur="1.68">and I&amp;#39;m still accidentally taking pictures</text><text start="610.77" dur="1.47">by tapping too hard.</text><text start="612.24" dur="2.52">And the scrolling, it has momentum physics</text><text start="614.76" dur="1.68">and you can accidentally scroll too far</text><text start="616.44" dur="1.8">and go past the thing you were targeting</text><text start="618.24" dur="2.73">in this more continuous
scrolling interface.</text><text start="620.97" dur="3.51">It is just finicky enough
and just hidden enough</text><text start="624.48" dur="1.59">that I honestly think like,</text><text start="626.07" dur="2.34">99% of people will never use this</text><text start="628.41" dur="3.033">for anything other than just
a camera shutter button.</text><text start="632.52" dur="1.53">And I guess that&amp;#39;s fine too.</text><text start="634.05" dur="1.5">I personally did quickly get used to</text><text start="635.55" dur="2.46">opening the camera quickly
with the Camera Control button.</text><text start="638.01" dur="2.22">And so I remapped my action button</text><text start="640.23" dur="2.01">to something else, my Tasks app.</text><text start="642.24" dur="2.34">And I&amp;#39;ve also remapped
my lock screen shortcut</text><text start="644.58" dur="3.24">so it&amp;#39;s now flashlight
and my Tasks app again.</text><text start="647.82" dur="1.74">And you can always just
swipe over sideways</text><text start="649.56" dur="1.89">from the lock screen and
get to the stock camera app.</text><text start="651.45" dur="3.3">So if you really want, you can
map the Camera Control button</text><text start="654.75" dur="3.39">to open any other camera
app on your phone,</text><text start="658.14" dur="2.07">or just keep waiting for
Apple Intelligence features</text><text start="660.21" dur="1.83">that this will probably
make more sense for.</text><text start="662.04" dur="3.3">So yeah, long story
short, one, it&amp;#39;s a button.</text><text start="665.34" dur="3.045">Two, it&amp;#39;s also a customization slider.</text><text start="668.385" dur="4.305">Three, it&amp;#39;s just gonna be
a button for most people.</text><text start="672.69" dur="2.635">But also four, there are
new cameras on the back.</text><text start="675.325" dur="2.583">(bright music)</text><text start="679.397" dur="2.533">So there&amp;#39;s a bunch of new
cameras across the line</text><text start="681.93" dur="2.79">for both iPhone 16 and 16 Pro.</text><text start="684.72" dur="1.23">Best way to summarize it,</text><text start="685.95" dur="3.48">okay, so iPhone 16&amp;#39;s cameras are nice,</text><text start="689.43" dur="2.01">like they&amp;#39;re pretty solid main cameras,</text><text start="691.44" dur="2.34">very much in character
with iPhones of the past</text><text start="693.78" dur="3.33">but not noticeably better
than previous years.</text><text start="697.11" dur="3.72">And then the 16 Pro cameras
with the much bigger main sensor</text><text start="700.83" dur="3.48">and the higher resolution
ultrawide and the 5X telephoto</text><text start="704.31" dur="2.94">are a significant step up, in my opinion.</text><text start="707.25" dur="3.18">The main camera I think is
my favorite primary sensor</text><text start="710.43" dur="1.98">in any smartphone to shoot with right now.</text><text start="712.41" dur="3.06">It&amp;#39;s really good at basically everything.</text><text start="715.47" dur="2.07">The ultrawide is also better,</text><text start="717.54" dur="2.64">but kind of only in
detail during the daytime</text><text start="720.18" dur="2.13">since it&amp;#39;s a 48 megapixel sensor now.</text><text start="722.31" dur="2.16">But the sensor&amp;#39;s not bigger enough</text><text start="724.47" dur="1.74">to matter at night, though.</text><text start="726.21" dur="1.62">And now my night ultrawides</text><text start="727.83" dur="2.82">all look kind of
vignetted for some reason.</text><text start="730.65" dur="3.12">I mean, look at that, it
looks like I added a filter.</text><text start="733.77" dur="3.78">But then the 5X telephoto on
both the Pros is also nice now.</text><text start="737.55" dur="2.01">And there is some chatter
about it being worse</text><text start="739.56" dur="1.8">at the 3X to 4X range</text><text start="741.36" dur="2.16">because you&amp;#39;re still
having to do digital zoom.</text><text start="743.52" dur="1.59">And technically that&amp;#39;s true,</text><text start="745.11" dur="2.19">but I find the 5X to be
a pretty useful zoom.</text><text start="747.3" dur="2.67">And it&amp;#39;s also better at
resolving all the detail past 5X</text><text start="749.97" dur="2.25">than before, even without AI.</text><text start="752.22" dur="2.1">Shutter speeds are super fast</text><text start="754.32" dur="2.46">and freeze action better than ever before.</text><text start="756.78" dur="1.56">This is kind of underrated,
but I love this.</text><text start="758.34" dur="3.51">Like, this shot came from a
moving car at highway speed,</text><text start="761.85" dur="2.49">and so did this one, so that&amp;#39;s sick.</text><text start="764.34" dur="2.61">And the ease at which you can
get a shallow depth of field</text><text start="766.95" dur="1.23">with a closeup subject</text><text start="768.18" dur="2.85">is on par with any other
big sensor Android flagship</text><text start="771.03" dur="2.958">like S24 Ultra or Pixel 9 Pro.</text><text start="773.988" dur="4.242">And no, Apple has absolutely
not fixed the lens flare issue</text><text start="778.23" dur="1.44">with point lights at night.</text><text start="779.67" dur="2.64">So for those who are wondering, sorry.</text><text start="782.31" dur="3.51">But aside from that,
video is very impressive.</text><text start="785.82" dur="1.86">I&amp;#39;ll be publishing the
next Auto Focus video</text><text start="787.68" dur="2.49">on the Silverado EV
pickup truck pretty soon,</text><text start="790.17" dur="1.92">so subscribe over there
for that, first of all.</text><text start="792.09" dur="3">But that&amp;#39;s gonna be shot
entirely on iPhone 16 Pro</text><text start="795.09" dur="1.5">and I&amp;#39;ve been very happy with it.</text><text start="796.59" dur="4.331">And Apple also added a 4K 120
FPS mode to the Pro phones,</text><text start="800.921" dur="1.339">and it&amp;#39;s sick.</text><text start="802.26" dur="0.833">It looks great.</text><text start="803.093" dur="2.407">It is really convenient to shoot and edit.</text><text start="805.5" dur="2.52">The only thing you gotta
be careful with is storage,</text><text start="808.02" dur="3.27">&amp;#39;cause it can really eat up storage.</text><text start="811.29" dur="2.43">Like, you can get up
to near a gig a minute</text><text start="813.72" dur="4.8">and that&amp;#39;s before you even do
4K 120 ProRes or ProRes Log.</text><text start="818.52" dur="1.8">But yeah, I still love shooting it anyway.</text><text start="820.32" dur="3.949">It also proves to me that
they have the processing power</text><text start="824.269" dur="4.481">and the sensor readout speed to do 8K 30,</text><text start="828.75" dur="1.833">they just choose not to.</text><text start="831.78" dur="1.05">And I wonder why sometimes.</text><text start="832.83" dur="0.87">This is also the first year</text><text start="833.7" dur="2.76">they&amp;#39;re using the term Fusion camera.</text><text start="836.46" dur="1.77">And you kinda have to dig in a little bit</text><text start="838.23" dur="1.83">to try to figure out what that means.</text><text start="840.06" dur="3.78">Turns out it&amp;#39;s basically the
same thing as last year&amp;#39;s,</text><text start="843.84" dur="3.6">like, punch-in optical quality zoom,</text><text start="847.44" dur="2.88">but with a slightly updated
image processing pipeline.</text><text start="850.32" dur="0.84">Cool.</text><text start="851.16" dur="1.26">But also that zoom</text><text start="852.42" dur="3.21">is not technically
one-to-one optical quality</text><text start="855.63" dur="3.03">because the photo sights are
smaller in that smaller crop.</text><text start="858.66" dur="3.96">Nevertheless, iPhone 16 camera, good.</text><text start="862.62" dur="3.006">iPhone 16 Pro camera, great.</text><text start="865.626" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text><text start="871.32" dur="3.66">There is something truly
weird about this product</text><text start="874.98" dur="4.08">being launched at an Apple
event called Glowtime</text><text start="879.06" dur="3.96">and not launching with the
thing that glows, the new Siri.</text><text start="883.02" dur="1.32">There&amp;#39;s something weird about people</text><text start="884.34" dur="2.79">happily going out to a 5th
Avenue Apple store this week</text><text start="887.13" dur="2.19">which is literally
glowing with rainbows now,</text><text start="889.32" dur="1.89">and walking out with a brand new phone</text><text start="891.21" dur="1.53">that doesn&amp;#39;t have that.</text><text start="892.74" dur="1.95">Like, there&amp;#39;s something just off</text><text start="894.69" dur="2.7">about billboards and marketing material</text><text start="897.39" dur="1.89">all highlighting Apple Intelligence,</text><text start="899.28" dur="2.49">and Tim Cook saying
this was the first phone</text><text start="901.77" dur="3.099">built from the ground up
for Apple Intelligence.</text><text start="904.869" dur="2.931">- The next generation of
iPhone has been designed</text><text start="907.8" dur="2.7">for Apple Intelligence from the ground up.</text><text start="910.5" dur="4.71">- Yet this phone does not have
Apple Intelligence at all.</text><text start="915.21" dur="3.51">It&amp;#39;s all coming soon and
coming later this year</text><text start="918.72" dur="2.49">and into next year eventually
with software updates.</text><text start="921.21" dur="1.92">But if I&amp;#39;ve said it once,
I&amp;#39;ve said it a million times,</text><text start="923.13" dur="3.09">never buy a product based on the promise</text><text start="926.22" dur="1.41">of future software updates.</text><text start="927.63" dur="2.64">Buy it for what it is
right now when you buy it.</text><text start="930.27" dur="3.086">That&amp;#39;s been the golden rule for forever.</text><text start="933.356" dur="4.294">But yet here we are, times have changed.</text><text start="937.65" dur="3.63">This has been a common trend alongside AI.</text><text start="941.28" dur="2.04">And you think Apple might be
immune to it, but they&amp;#39;re not.</text><text start="943.32" dur="0.93">They&amp;#39;re a public company.</text><text start="944.25" dur="2.25">And just like lots of
other public companies,</text><text start="946.5" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;ve sort of caved to this pressure</text><text start="949.14" dur="1.587">that they have to appear</text><text start="950.727" dur="4.173">like an AI-first, AI-forward
company, like a leader in AI.</text><text start="954.9" dur="3.81">So they have presented a ton of AI stuff</text><text start="958.71" dur="2.46">that they&amp;#39;re working on, and
they&amp;#39;ve done the song and dance</text><text start="961.17" dur="1.62">of like, &amp;quot;Hey, we&amp;#39;re AI-first</text><text start="962.79" dur="2.73">and the phone&amp;#39;s built
from the ground up for AI.</text><text start="965.52" dur="1.62">It&amp;#39;s our whole theme this year.&amp;quot;</text><text start="967.14" dur="3.03">But the fact of the matter
is it&amp;#39;s not good yet.</text><text start="970.17" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s not.</text><text start="971.003" dur="1.207">It&amp;#39;s actually not even finished.</text><text start="972.21" dur="1.44">If it was, they&amp;#39;d be shipping it.</text><text start="973.65" dur="2.73">But it&amp;#39;s in beta and
they&amp;#39;re still working on it</text><text start="976.38" dur="2.13">and they&amp;#39;d rather keep working on it</text><text start="978.51" dur="1.533">than ship it to you now.</text><text start="981.36" dur="2.73">So how do we square this?</text><text start="984.09" dur="2.103">Do we even square this?</text><text start="987.57" dur="1.62">You remember the Rabbit R1.</text><text start="989.19" dur="2.82">The Rabbit was a little AI in a box,</text><text start="992.01" dur="2.43">pretty classic 2024 product.</text><text start="994.44" dur="3.6">When I reviewed that Rabbit,
it was basically useless,</text><text start="998.04" dur="3.305">like literally almost none of
the functionality was working</text><text start="1001.345" dur="1.015">as it shipped.</text><text start="1002.36" dur="1.95">And so I said so in the review.</text><text start="1004.31" dur="1.95">Same with the Humane AI Pin,</text><text start="1006.26" dur="2.7">really, really, really bad product</text><text start="1008.96" dur="2.55">missing almost all of its functionality.</text><text start="1011.51" dur="2.88">Worst product I&amp;#39;ve ever reviewed for now.</text><text start="1014.39" dur="3.15">Both of those products have
started to get some updates</text><text start="1017.54" dur="1.74">since I reviewed them.</text><text start="1019.28" dur="2.07">But again, I can only review
what&amp;#39;s in front of me,</text><text start="1021.35" dur="1.44">like I got that thing in the mail</text><text start="1022.79" dur="1.23">just like real customers</text><text start="1024.02" dur="1.83">are gonna get that thing in the mail,</text><text start="1025.85" dur="1.8">and now it feels like the new iPhone</text><text start="1027.65" dur="1.95">is suddenly in the same boat.</text><text start="1029.6" dur="0.9">So I guess the difference</text><text start="1030.5" dur="4.89">between the Rabbit and the
Humane Pin and the iPhone is,</text><text start="1035.39" dur="3.9">well, one, the iPhone is
a fine standalone product</text><text start="1039.29" dur="1.53">even without the promised stuff.</text><text start="1040.82" dur="1.35">And it&amp;#39;s viable and usable,</text><text start="1042.17" dur="1.83">where the other two, not so much.</text><text start="1044" dur="5">But two is that Apple at
least now has some element</text><text start="1050.21" dur="4.23">of a track record of
developing and shipping things</text><text start="1054.44" dur="4.56">that they promised, where
Humane and Rabbit didn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="1059" dur="3.15">So you could argue there&amp;#39;s
some dimension of trust to this</text><text start="1062.15" dur="2.43">and that Apple is really leaning heavily</text><text start="1064.58" dur="1.86">on how much you trust them.</text><text start="1066.44" dur="2.52">Because to be honest,
to me it&amp;#39;s really bold</text><text start="1068.96" dur="2.61">to be shipping the product
like this without any</text><text start="1071.57" dur="1.74">of these big things that you&amp;#39;re promising.</text><text start="1073.31" dur="2.28">Like, they must really
believe in themselves</text><text start="1075.59" dur="3.93">to eventually ship this stuff
so that people aren&amp;#39;t mad.</text><text start="1079.52" dur="3.54">But yeah, that&amp;#39;s the AI
world we live in, I guess,</text><text start="1083.06" dur="1.77">is that everyone has this pressure</text><text start="1084.83" dur="1.83">to feel like a leader in AI</text><text start="1086.66" dur="2.49">and be shipping all these
new features and stuff.</text><text start="1089.15" dur="3.78">But a lot of it, not that
good yet, not that done yet.</text><text start="1092.93" dur="1.38">So I&amp;#39;m planning an entire separate review</text><text start="1094.31" dur="2.88">of Apple Intelligence as
a whole when it comes out.</text><text start="1097.19" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;ve been using some of
the features in 18.1 Beta</text><text start="1100.52" dur="3">on my 15 Pro, but even
this is really limited.</text><text start="1103.52" dur="1.62">Like, it&amp;#39;s basically just writing tools</text><text start="1105.14" dur="2.25">and the new Siri animation.</text><text start="1107.39" dur="1.38">But they have a long way to go.</text><text start="1108.77" dur="1.5">I&amp;#39;ll say get subscribed</text><text start="1110.27" dur="2.61">to see the Apple Intelligence
review when it drops,</text><text start="1112.88" dur="0.99">when it&amp;#39;s done,</text><text start="1113.87" dur="3.346">because clearly it&amp;#39;s a
big part of this phone.</text><text start="1117.216" dur="2.583">(bright music)</text><text start="1124.01" dur="2.453">So you made it this far into the video,</text><text start="1126.463" dur="1.987">or you skipped ahead to this chapter</text><text start="1128.45" dur="0.99">&amp;#39;cause you just really wanted an answer</text><text start="1129.44" dur="1.83">on if you should buy these phones or not.</text><text start="1131.27" dur="1.41">Fine either way.</text><text start="1132.68" dur="4.68">So okay, you should buy the iPhone 16</text><text start="1137.36" dur="4.47">if you&amp;#39;re on an iPhone 13 or older</text><text start="1141.83" dur="2.31">and you know, that phone
is on its last legs</text><text start="1144.14" dur="3.33">and you&amp;#39;re really looking for
an upgrade to a new iPhone.</text><text start="1147.47" dur="0.833">Fine.</text><text start="1148.303" dur="0.833">Anything newer</text><text start="1149.136" dur="2.294">and it probably won&amp;#39;t feel
like it&amp;#39;s worth an upgrade.</text><text start="1151.43" dur="3.09">And you should buy the iPhone 16 Pro</text><text start="1154.52" dur="5">if you really want a better
phone in cameras or displays.</text><text start="1159.86" dur="1.35">That&amp;#39;s really the two places</text><text start="1161.21" dur="2.25">where the Pro shines
over the regular phone.</text><text start="1163.46" dur="2.67">The cheap iPhone really has
never looked better, honestly.</text><text start="1166.13" dur="1.5">It has the Camera Control,</text><text start="1167.63" dur="2.85">it matches the RAM of
the more expensive Pros,</text><text start="1170.48" dur="2.25">it has the more interesting
colors if you&amp;#39;re into that.</text><text start="1172.73" dur="2.07">It has the action button now too.</text><text start="1174.8" dur="1.86">And it has the same
brightness of the display</text><text start="1176.66" dur="1.86">and it also goes all
the way down to one nit,</text><text start="1178.52" dur="1.17">just like the Pro screen.</text><text start="1179.69" dur="2.46">Now, I personally cannot use</text><text start="1182.15" dur="4.5">a 60 hertz, $800 phone in 2024.</text><text start="1186.65" dur="0.833">I just can&amp;#39;t do it.</text><text start="1187.483" dur="1.837">And there are lots of people just like me</text><text start="1189.32" dur="1.86">who will immediately have
to upgrade to the Pro</text><text start="1191.18" dur="1.41">just for that.</text><text start="1192.59" dur="4.41">But there are also tons of
people who don&amp;#39;t even notice</text><text start="1197" dur="1.8">or care about ProMotion.</text><text start="1198.8" dur="3.24">Which, I know, it&amp;#39;s kinda hard
to wrap my head around too.</text><text start="1202.04" dur="1.9">But for those people, yeah,</text><text start="1203.94" dur="1.76">the base phone is gonna be great.</text><text start="1205.7" dur="2.25">But then as someone who shoots
a lot of photos and videos</text><text start="1207.95" dur="2.04">and you know, social media
stuff, the Auto Focus channel,</text><text start="1209.99" dur="1.17">between all that,</text><text start="1211.16" dur="2.61">the cameras are better enough on the Pros</text><text start="1213.77" dur="2.46">for that to be worth the upgrade for me.</text><text start="1216.23" dur="3.9">But yeah, I still say buy
it for what it is today,</text><text start="1220.13" dur="2.13">not for what it could be tomorrow.</text><text start="1222.26" dur="2.88">And even without any of the AI stuff</text><text start="1225.14" dur="3.54">maybe ever coming to these
phones, they&amp;#39;re still rock solid,</text><text start="1228.68" dur="2.913">very, very incremental upgrades.</text><text start="1232.67" dur="1.59">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="1234.26" dur="1.47">Catch you guys in the next one.</text><text start="1235.73" dur="2.593">Peace.
