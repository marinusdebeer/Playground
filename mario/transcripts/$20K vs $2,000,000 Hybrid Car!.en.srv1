(icons boinging)</text><text start="3.24" dur="2.34">- So in a world of electric
cars, in this video,</text><text start="5.58" dur="2.73">we&amp;#39;re gonna be taking a
look at a $20,000 hybrid,</text><text start="8.31" dur="4.74">a $120,000 hybrid, and
a $2 million hybrid car.</text><text start="13.05" dur="1.41">So this video is part an explainer,</text><text start="14.46" dur="2.49">part a chance to drive
some really sick cars.</text><text start="16.95" dur="2.07">Shout out to Triple F
Collection, we&amp;#39;ll get there.</text><text start="19.02" dur="2.07">Anyway, unless you guys have
been living under a rock,</text><text start="21.09" dur="1.95">you&amp;#39;ve seen that electric
cars have been having</text><text start="23.04" dur="1.23">a bit of a renaissance lately,</text><text start="24.27" dur="3.57">surging in popularity till
the number one best sold</text><text start="27.84" dur="1.8">new car on earth is electric,</text><text start="29.64" dur="3.75">but they are still very
much a new technology.</text><text start="33.39" dur="2.16">Like they&amp;#39;re obviously
awesome with instant torque</text><text start="35.55" dur="2.7">and no emissions and fast acceleration,</text><text start="38.25" dur="2.55">but they have these huge, heavy batteries</text><text start="40.8" dur="1.53">and they take forever to recharge</text><text start="42.33" dur="1.23">and there&amp;#39;s not enough infrastructure</text><text start="43.56" dur="2.55">for everyone to own them,
so there&amp;#39;s this window now</text><text start="46.11" dur="3.42">where it makes a lot of sense
that maybe for most people,</text><text start="49.53" dur="3.69">a hybrid is actually the best option.</text><text start="53.22" dur="0.833">Interesting.</text><text start="61.528" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text><text start="68.614" dur="2.846">(upbeat music continues)</text><text start="71.46" dur="2.22">So I don&amp;#39;t think anyone&amp;#39;s
buying the Corolla</text><text start="73.68" dur="2.16">for speed or power.</text><text start="75.84" dur="0.99">I mean, if I&amp;#39;m being honest,</text><text start="76.83" dur="1.83">it&amp;#39;s actually still pretty zippy.</text><text start="78.66" dur="3.93">So this car starts at $24,000</text><text start="82.59" dur="4.56">and it&amp;#39;s a hybrid purely,
purely for efficiency.</text><text start="87.15" dur="1.74">So the basics of this hybrid system,</text><text start="88.89" dur="1.62">and many others in the same class,</text><text start="90.51" dur="3.03">is that the wheels can be
driven by the gas engine</text><text start="93.54" dur="2.37">or the electric motor, or both.</text><text start="95.91" dur="2.97">So this Corolla hybrid
has a 1.8 liter engine</text><text start="98.88" dur="2.25">and one electric motor at the front axle</text><text start="101.13" dur="3.24">that deliver a combined 138 horsepower</text><text start="104.37" dur="1.62">and it&amp;#39;s powering the electric motor</text><text start="105.99" dur="3.48">with a pretty small 1.6
kilowatt hour battery.</text><text start="109.47" dur="2.31">So at low speeds, you&amp;#39;ve
probably been in a car like this,</text><text start="111.78" dur="3.48">the car goes totally electric,
the gas engine turns off,</text><text start="115.26" dur="1.71">but once you go over a certain speed,</text><text start="116.97" dur="1.32">or use a certain amount of power,</text><text start="118.29" dur="2.04">then it&amp;#39;s gonna fire
up the gas engine again</text><text start="120.33" dur="1.8">and it couples it with the electric motor.</text><text start="122.13" dur="2.22">Then anytime you&amp;#39;re braking or coasting,</text><text start="124.35" dur="2.37">that&amp;#39;s when it charges
the battery back up.</text><text start="126.72" dur="1.44">It&amp;#39;s as you&amp;#39;re slowing down,</text><text start="128.16" dur="1.5">it captures some of that energy,</text><text start="129.66" dur="2.07">so it never actually
needs to be plugged in</text><text start="131.73" dur="1.77">to charge up that small battery,</text><text start="133.5" dur="3.9">and this system is good for
literally 50 miles per gallon.</text><text start="137.4" dur="3.87">When you drive this car, you
literally have a game score,</text><text start="141.27" dur="4.74">an eco score as you drive
of if you can slow down</text><text start="146.01" dur="2.04">and roll onto your accelerations better</text><text start="148.05" dur="5">and roll to a stop more easily,
you can gamify efficiency</text><text start="153.18" dur="2.91">in this car to get your
maximum miles per gallon.</text><text start="156.09" dur="1.08">So it actually divides it up.</text><text start="157.17" dur="2.01">I have my eco zone, so I&amp;#39;m driving</text><text start="159.18" dur="2.01">and if I get my little
bar in the eco zone,</text><text start="161.19" dur="1.35">I&amp;#39;m doing a good job.</text><text start="162.54" dur="3.24">And then I have starts, cruises and stops.</text><text start="165.78" dur="2.58">I&amp;#39;ve gotten my eco score
pretty high, not to brag,</text><text start="168.36" dur="2.97">but I&amp;#39;ve seen it in the
70s, which is pretty sick.</text><text start="171.33" dur="1.68">I don&amp;#39;t know what happens
when I get to 100,</text><text start="173.01" dur="2.94">but what I do know is the
better I get that score,</text><text start="175.95" dur="1.41">the more miles per gallon I get.</text><text start="177.36" dur="1.95">But yeah, pretty much everything
about the rest of this car</text><text start="179.31" dur="2.34">is designed around that efficiency.</text><text start="181.65" dur="2.82">It&amp;#39;s aerodynamic enough that
it slips through the air.</text><text start="184.47" dur="2.79">It&amp;#39;s got tires that have
a low rolling resistance.</text><text start="187.26" dur="2.13">It doesn&amp;#39;t have these
like sticky grippy tires.</text><text start="189.39" dur="3">That&amp;#39;s actually against
efficiency, in this case.</text><text start="192.39" dur="1.62">So if you&amp;#39;re looking
for a reason why someone</text><text start="194.01" dur="1.8">would buy a hybrid today,</text><text start="195.81" dur="1.26">it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re not trying</text><text start="197.07" dur="3.36">to charge a huge battery
every night in their garage</text><text start="200.43" dur="3.99">or rely on the grid or rely
on finding public chargers.</text><text start="204.42" dur="2.34">It&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;cause they just
want better gas mileage</text><text start="206.76" dur="5">and they wanna spend less, not
zero, but less on gas today.</text><text start="211.812" dur="1.698">(car dinging)</text><text start="213.51" dur="3.06">But you already know,
these cars are obviously</text><text start="216.57" dur="1.38">very utility focused.</text><text start="217.95" dur="3.54">They&amp;#39;re for people who just
are going places, right?</text><text start="221.49" dur="4.44">But what if you&amp;#39;re more after
the ultimate driving machine,</text><text start="225.93" dur="1.8">something a little more versatile?</text><text start="227.73" dur="1.65">Then you can spend a little more money</text><text start="229.38" dur="1.743">and get something like this.</text><text start="232.427" dur="2.417">(beat music)</text><text start="239.34" dur="3.87">All right, so this car
starts at about $100,000,</text><text start="243.21" dur="4.59">a little over, and this car
is a hybrid for versatility.</text><text start="247.8" dur="3.15">So the idea is this is a BMW 750e.</text><text start="250.95" dur="2.91">There&amp;#39;s a bunch of vehicles in this class,</text><text start="253.86" dur="2.43">but yeah, you&amp;#39;ve spent enough
money now at this point</text><text start="256.29" dur="4.86">that you can reap the benefits
of both gas and electric.</text><text start="261.15" dur="2.73">So this hybrid system
has a bit more hardware</text><text start="263.88" dur="1.83">to accomplish two different goals,</text><text start="265.71" dur="2.16">so there&amp;#39;s a three liter
straight six engine</text><text start="267.87" dur="1.62">making around 300 horsepower,</text><text start="269.49" dur="4.89">and a medium sized 14.4
kilowatt hour larger battery,</text><text start="274.38" dur="2.88">powering a roughly 200
horsepower electric motor,</text><text start="277.26" dur="2.4">so you&amp;#39;re totaling around 500 horsepower.</text><text start="279.66" dur="4.05">So once again, it can drive
using both gas and electric,</text><text start="283.71" dur="0.96">just like the Toyota,</text><text start="284.67" dur="2.25">but now there&amp;#39;s enough battery capacity</text><text start="286.92" dur="3.18">that you can also drive fully electric</text><text start="290.1" dur="2.7">at totally normal everyday driving speeds</text><text start="292.8" dur="2.4">up to like 30 miles on a charge</text><text start="295.2" dur="1.68">without ever turning on the gas engine,</text><text start="296.88" dur="3.24">and then also, unlike the
Corolla, this is a plug-in hybrid</text><text start="300.12" dur="2.28">so you can directly
plug the car into a wall</text><text start="302.4" dur="2.88">to replenish the battery
and just keep driving around</text><text start="305.28" dur="3.39">on electric as long as you
want to with zero gas use,</text><text start="308.67" dur="2.34">so it does everything in
the Toyota does, but more.</text><text start="311.01" dur="2.52">I do feel like plug-in
hybrids at this moment in time</text><text start="313.53" dur="3.15">are the one that make the most sense</text><text start="316.68" dur="2.79">for the most people that I see driving &amp;#39;em</text><text start="319.47" dur="1.44">&amp;#39;cause if you have a short commute,</text><text start="320.91" dur="2.76">let&amp;#39;s say you have a 10
mile commute every day</text><text start="323.67" dur="2.79">and you just plug in at a charger at work</text><text start="326.46" dur="2.01">or in your garage every night</text><text start="328.47" dur="1.92">or during work in the daytime,</text><text start="330.39" dur="2.91">you can just straight up
never pay for gas again</text><text start="333.3" dur="2.16">and drive it just like an electric car,</text><text start="335.46" dur="2.22">but on the off chance you
do need to drive further,</text><text start="337.68" dur="2.52">go for a road trip, or
just do something more</text><text start="340.2" dur="1.8">than your normal 10 mile commute,</text><text start="342" dur="2.28">you have all the benefits of a gas car.</text><text start="344.28" dur="3.09">Thankfully these hybrids
also have one crucial piece</text><text start="347.37" dur="3.48">of the electric car, which
is regenerative braking,</text><text start="350.85" dur="1.71">which means it&amp;#39;s gonna
be able to recuperate</text><text start="352.56" dur="2.46">a lot of the energy once
I&amp;#39;ve gotten up to speed</text><text start="355.02" dur="2.82">and start filling up the
battery as I&amp;#39;m driving.</text><text start="357.84" dur="2.58">So there&amp;#39;s a little graph on
the dash you can see here,</text><text start="360.42" dur="1.86">which means as I accelerate</text><text start="362.28" dur="2.4">and I take energy out of
the battery, it goes up,</text><text start="364.68" dur="2.67">but as I decelerate,
it&amp;#39;s actually blending</text><text start="367.35" dur="2.73">and friction braking with
regenerative braking,</text><text start="370.08" dur="1.68">and if I drive around
like this long enough,</text><text start="371.76" dur="2.13">especially if I go down
hills and break a lot,</text><text start="373.89" dur="2.64">I will actually start adding to the charge</text><text start="376.53" dur="1.38">of this battery too.</text><text start="377.91" dur="2.55">But you know how electric cars
also have that party trick</text><text start="380.46" dur="4.323">of instant torque available
at any RPM and any speed?</text><text start="385.65" dur="2.79">Well, the hybrid should benefit
a little bit from that too.</text><text start="388.44" dur="2.22">So because this motor is powerful enough</text><text start="390.66" dur="2.67">and the battery is big enough
to provide the voltage,</text><text start="393.33" dur="2.79">yes, in the sportiest mode, this car also,</text><text start="396.12" dur="2.37">when you floor it, gets that initial hit</text><text start="398.49" dur="3.15">from the electricity and
then follows with the surge</text><text start="401.64" dur="2.61">of the rest of the power
from the gas engine.</text><text start="404.25" dur="1.38">Oh, and one of the things I say a lot</text><text start="405.63" dur="2.1">on the Auto Focus channel,
or I&amp;#39;ve said before,</text><text start="407.73" dur="2.67">is there are certain types of cars</text><text start="410.4" dur="2.31">that are best to go electric,</text><text start="412.71" dur="3.42">and because of how much batteries weigh,</text><text start="416.13" dur="1.71">cars that are already heavy</text><text start="417.84" dur="1.59">are the best ones to go electric.</text><text start="419.43" dur="2.49">So like this is a big
four-door luxury sedan.</text><text start="421.92" dur="2.82">There is no attempt on
making this a small car.</text><text start="424.74" dur="4.29">It&amp;#39;s huge, it&amp;#39;s got lots of
space, it&amp;#39;s soft, it&amp;#39;s cushy.</text><text start="429.03" dur="2.28">This is a great type
of car to go electric,</text><text start="431.31" dur="2.4">which is why the i7 is good,</text><text start="433.71" dur="2.1">but yeah, there are lots
of other versions of this.</text><text start="435.81" dur="3.51">The RAV4 hybrid, the
Toyota Prius Prime hybrid,</text><text start="439.32" dur="1.86">all sorts of other plug-in hybrids.</text><text start="441.18" dur="3.03">Yeah, if I were to recommend
one version for more people,</text><text start="444.21" dur="2.82">like this, you still get all
the nice plushy suspension</text><text start="447.03" dur="3.18">and all of the tech in the
car and all the screens</text><text start="450.21" dur="3.3">and the way it drives,
it&amp;#39;s the same thing,</text><text start="453.51" dur="1.92">but more accessible.</text><text start="455.43" dur="2.25">You don&amp;#39;t have to have
a plug in your garage.</text><text start="458.91" dur="1.53">So all that is fun.</text><text start="460.44" dur="1.95">That&amp;#39;s, I get it. It&amp;#39;s versatile.</text><text start="462.39" dur="3.6">This is why they call it the
ultimate driving machine,</text><text start="465.99" dur="1.38">but you can always spend more.</text><text start="467.37" dur="1.68">You can always spend more.</text><text start="469.05" dur="5">And when you do, you end up in
the territory of specialists</text><text start="474.6" dur="2.733">and this is definitely a specialist.</text><text start="478.41" dur="1.427">Just give me a second.</text><text start="479.837" dur="2.667">(door whirring)</text><text start="485.647" dur="2.693">Hold on a second, just wanna...</text><text start="488.34" dur="0.833">Okay.</text><text start="490.663" dur="0.95">Now close that.</text><text start="494.003" dur="2.5">(jazzy music)</text><text start="499.694" dur="5">♪ I&amp;#39;ve just got eyes for you ♪</text><text start="504.94" dur="3.546">♪ No other could enchant me ♪</text><text start="508.486" dur="2.697">♪ Darlin&amp;#39; like you do ♪</text><text start="511.183" dur="4.333">♪ &amp;#39;Cause I&amp;#39;ve just got eyes for you ♪</text><text start="517.29" dur="2.767">- So this car costs $2.5 million</text><text start="524.79" dur="4.2">and it&amp;#39;s a hybrid purely for performance,</text><text start="528.99" dur="2.61">which I mean, you could probably
tell just by looking at it,</text><text start="531.6" dur="1.89">but also by the fact that I&amp;#39;m sitting</text><text start="533.49" dur="2.13">in the middle of the car now.</text><text start="535.62" dur="2.253">I have to get used to this.</text><text start="537.873" dur="2.907">This is the McLaren Speedtail.</text><text start="540.78" dur="1.71">So McLaren&amp;#39;s done this a few times.</text><text start="542.49" dur="4.77">One center driver&amp;#39;s seat,
two passenger seats,</text><text start="547.26" dur="2.79">and just a whole lot of calibration for me</text><text start="550.05" dur="2.52">for this insane driving position.</text><text start="552.57" dur="1.77">But yeah, this thing is a hybrid.</text><text start="554.34" dur="1.41">It&amp;#39;s technically a hybrid.</text><text start="555.75" dur="2.97">So this hybrid system is pretty crazy.</text><text start="558.72" dur="3.18">It&amp;#39;s very focused on
literally just going as fast</text><text start="561.9" dur="3.03">as physically possible, which
is just about maximizing power</text><text start="564.93" dur="1.11">and minimizing weight.</text><text start="566.04" dur="2.34">So there&amp;#39;s already a twin turbo</text><text start="568.38" dur="3.93">four liter V8 engine pushing
out 750 plus horsepower,</text><text start="572.31" dur="3.39">but then they&amp;#39;ve also
designed a special small,</text><text start="575.7" dur="3.6">but super high-powered
1.6 kilowatt hour battery</text><text start="579.3" dur="2.79">that powers a single
electric motor by itself</text><text start="582.09" dur="3.51">that generates an extra
300 more horsepower.</text><text start="585.6" dur="2.64">So the total is now over 1,000 horsepower</text><text start="588.24" dur="2.94">and that motor is
basically just being used</text><text start="591.18" dur="3.33">to help spin the wheels
even faster than the engine</text><text start="594.51" dur="1.08">by itself could.</text><text start="595.59" dur="1.53">There is no electric-only mode.</text><text start="597.12" dur="3">There is no situation where
the gas engine ever shuts off.</text><text start="600.12" dur="1.71">There are no efficiency goals here.</text><text start="601.83" dur="1.68">This is actually really similar</text><text start="603.51" dur="2.28">to the turbocharged hybrid
setups you literally see</text><text start="605.79" dur="1.26">in Formula 1 today.</text><text start="607.05" dur="1.29">It&amp;#39;s just about going fast.</text><text start="608.34" dur="2.31">So here&amp;#39;s a couple of those
hilariously over-engineered</text><text start="610.65" dur="0.99">pieces of this car.</text><text start="611.64" dur="2.64">First of all, this is the only
car I&amp;#39;ve ever actually driven</text><text start="614.28" dur="3.09">that&amp;#39;s shipped with cameras
instead of side view mirrors,</text><text start="617.37" dur="2.16">for even better aerodynamics, of course.</text><text start="619.53" dur="2.37">They&amp;#39;ve also got the
electrochromic glass roof tint</text><text start="621.9" dur="3.24">and windshield tint instead
of moving fabric pieces.</text><text start="625.14" dur="3.27">But then also, the active
arrow on the back of this car</text><text start="628.41" dur="2.19">is not just like regular pivoting parts</text><text start="630.6" dur="1.62">or spoilers or anything like that,</text><text start="632.22" dur="3.69">but it&amp;#39;s literally bending
the carbon fiber body work,</text><text start="635.91" dur="3.15">and all of the paint and coatings with it</text><text start="639.06" dur="2.34">up and down when you&amp;#39;re under braking</text><text start="641.4" dur="1.77">to assist with slowing down.</text><text start="643.17" dur="2.04">That&amp;#39;s insane if you can
see what&amp;#39;s happening here.</text><text start="645.21" dur="1.89">And this is also the
only car I&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text><text start="647.1" dur="1.17">with a wireless charger.</text><text start="648.27" dur="2.7">That&amp;#39;s right, the McLaren
Speedtail wireless charges,</text><text start="650.97" dur="1.89">so the battery is at the bottom of the car</text><text start="652.86" dur="2.64">and it&amp;#39;s small enough that
if the driver doesn&amp;#39;t park</text><text start="655.5" dur="2.58">exactly over the right
spot in their garage,</text><text start="658.08" dur="1.8">it&amp;#39;s not a huge deal because, again,</text><text start="659.88" dur="1.74">it&amp;#39;s a small battery, it
shouldn&amp;#39;t take too long</text><text start="661.62" dur="2.13">and inductive charging has
never been particularly</text><text start="663.75" dur="1.77">efficient, but it&amp;#39;ll eventually work.</text><text start="665.52" dur="1.95">And no, I don&amp;#39;t think that this would fly</text><text start="667.47" dur="2.07">for any fully electric car today.</text><text start="669.54" dur="2.43">Everything about the outside
of this car is designed,</text><text start="671.97" dur="2.527">it&amp;#39;s sculpted to just cut through the air</text><text start="674.497" dur="4.013">and that&amp;#39;s how it does
zero to 186 miles an hour</text><text start="678.51" dur="1.98">faster than a Bugatti Chiron,</text><text start="680.49" dur="3.12">and 250 miles an hour in a straight line.</text><text start="683.61" dur="1.44">Now, I&amp;#39;m gonna let you
in on a little secret</text><text start="685.05" dur="4.05">about these super, super
fast electric cars.</text><text start="689.1" dur="1.98">They need a huge battery</text><text start="691.08" dur="2.13">to realistically make that happen, right?</text><text start="693.21" dur="2.46">Let&amp;#39;s take Tesla Model
S Plaid, for example.</text><text start="695.67" dur="3.78">1,000 horsepower, crazy high
power output from the battery,</text><text start="699.45" dur="2.22">but in order to do that, they
need to give it this huge</text><text start="701.67" dur="1.32">100 kilowatt hour battery</text><text start="702.99" dur="2.01">so that when you export all that power,</text><text start="705" dur="1.8">you don&amp;#39;t just drain the
battery super quickly,</text><text start="706.8" dur="2.31">you can keep driving like a normal person.</text><text start="709.11" dur="3.21">So that&amp;#39;s why you have
these super high horsepower</text><text start="712.32" dur="2.28">electric cars, but they always come</text><text start="714.6" dur="1.83">with the sacrifice of weight.</text><text start="716.43" dur="0.87">They&amp;#39;re always heavy.</text><text start="717.3" dur="2.49">The Lucid Air, it&amp;#39;s fighting its weight.</text><text start="719.79" dur="3.45">The EV6 GT, it&amp;#39;s fighting how heavy it is.</text><text start="723.24" dur="2.16">With a supercar like this,</text><text start="725.4" dur="2.31">it&amp;#39;s not fully electric all the time</text><text start="727.71" dur="2.67">and so they&amp;#39;re willing
to put in a tiny battery</text><text start="730.38" dur="1.95">that exports a ton of power</text><text start="732.33" dur="3.75">and basically drains it in seconds.</text><text start="736.08" dur="2.13">So I&amp;#39;m gonna show you
something with this real quick.</text><text start="738.21" dur="2.97">Right now I have 100% of my battery.</text><text start="741.18" dur="2.31">I&amp;#39;m gonna do just a quick little pull</text><text start="743.49" dur="2.73">and see just what a couple of seconds</text><text start="746.22" dur="2.433">of electric-assisted acceleration will do.</text><text start="749.82" dur="2.75">(engine revving)</text><text start="757.95" dur="3.72">Way down to 74% battery,</text><text start="761.67" dur="4.83">just from that little
acceleration, 100 to 74,</text><text start="766.5" dur="0.833">and now it&amp;#39;s already,</text><text start="767.333" dur="1.657">it&amp;#39;s going right back up to 100.</text><text start="768.99" dur="1.95">It&amp;#39;s almost 100 again because I&amp;#39;m driving</text><text start="770.94" dur="3.45">and recuperating that
energy and now it&amp;#39;s 100.</text><text start="774.39" dur="1.35">This is super high-tech stuff</text><text start="775.74" dur="2.46">and it actually has a lot of parallels</text><text start="778.2" dur="2.07">to what we see in Formula 1.</text><text start="780.27" dur="1.77">Believe it or not, those Formula 1 cars</text><text start="782.04" dur="1.65">that we&amp;#39;re watching on TV today,</text><text start="783.69" dur="4.38">those are small turbocharged
hybrid powertrains.</text><text start="788.07" dur="1.7">I kind of wanna do that again.</text><text start="789.77" dur="2.75">(engine revving)</text><text start="800.91" dur="1.8">That&amp;#39;s what the F1 cars
are doing out there.</text><text start="802.71" dur="3.18">They are recovering energy as they break,</text><text start="805.89" dur="3.09">and they are spending
energy when they accelerate.</text><text start="808.98" dur="1.5">And I guess that&amp;#39;s the
difference between this</text><text start="810.48" dur="1.05">and the Rimac Nevera.</text><text start="811.53" dur="2.49">You remember, you probably
have seen the video I did</text><text start="814.02" dur="1.8">with the quickest
electric car in the world,</text><text start="815.82" dur="3.75">the Rimac Nevera, which yes,
does have a big heavy battery.</text><text start="819.57" dur="3.42">It weighs like 5,000
pounds like a Model S.</text><text start="822.99" dur="2.16">The crazy thing about that
car, and that&amp;#39;s an anomaly,</text><text start="825.15" dur="1.53">is that it has four electric motors,</text><text start="826.68" dur="2.73">which you can kind of think of
as being treated like gears,</text><text start="829.41" dur="1.2">but not really.</text><text start="830.61" dur="1.56">This will have a higher top speed</text><text start="832.17" dur="2.7">simply because it just keeps gearing up,</text><text start="834.87" dur="3.66">seven speed gearbox, and it
pulls all the way through</text><text start="838.53" dur="2.28">up to 250 miles an hour.</text><text start="840.81" dur="2.37">If you want a hybrid supercar,</text><text start="843.18" dur="4.8">you can kind of have both fast
and quick in the same car.</text><text start="847.98" dur="1.32">This is fast and quick.</text><text start="849.3" dur="4.2">I mean, it&amp;#39;s not razor
sharp, fully electric quick,</text><text start="853.5" dur="2.58">but it&amp;#39;s close and it&amp;#39;s,
yeah, it&amp;#39;s the fastest,</text><text start="856.08" dur="2.52">it&amp;#39;s one of the fastest
cars you can possibly build.</text><text start="858.6" dur="3.36">Yeah, so I guess my point
here with the whole video is,</text><text start="861.96" dur="3.96">yes, I still fully believe
electrification is the future</text><text start="865.92" dur="3.93">at every level of cars,
but in the meantime,</text><text start="869.85" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that
hybrids make a lot of sense</text><text start="873.09" dur="2.82">and they&amp;#39;ve been right under
our noses the whole time.</text><text start="875.91" dur="0.833">That&amp;#39;s about it.</text><text start="877.95" dur="2.269">I got your driver&amp;#39;s speed deal.</text><text start="880.219" dur="3.083">(light upbeat music)</text></transcript>
