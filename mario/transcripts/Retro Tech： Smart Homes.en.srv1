<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="2.569" dur="4.204">Futurists imagined a world
where homes didn&amp;#39;t just contain
smart devices,</text><text start="6.806" dur="4.738">&lt;i&gt; but they were living,
 breathing entities themselves&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="11.577" dur="2.87">&lt;i&gt; that anticipated
 your every move.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="14.48" dur="2.937">&lt;i&gt; So, how close are we
 to this vision,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="17.45" dur="2.703">&lt;i&gt; and just how much smarter&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="20.186" dur="3.303">do we want our homes
to become?</text><text start="23.522" dur="2.737">&lt;i&gt; I&amp;#39;m Marques Brownlee,
 and I review dope new tech.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="26.292" dur="2.503">&lt;i&gt; But on this show,
 I&amp;#39;m rewinding the clock&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="28.828" dur="1.635">&lt;i&gt; to look at the tech
 of the past&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="30.496" dur="3.304">&lt;i&gt; that we thought
 would be our future.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="33.833" dur="3.67">&lt;i&gt; This is &amp;quot;Retro Tech:
 Smart Homes.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="37.536" dur="2.136">Hey, what&amp;#39;s up? MKBHD here.</text><text start="39.705" dur="2.136">And the tech we&amp;#39;re talking
about today</text><text start="41.874" dur="2.57">is smart home technology.</text><text start="44.477" dur="2.035">So, I clearly have no idea
what I&amp;#39;m about to unbox,</text><text start="46.545" dur="3.104">but it comes from 1992.</text><text start="49.682" dur="2.603">Let&amp;#39;s see...</text><text start="52.318" dur="2.436">what we have here.</text><text start="54.787" dur="3.37">The Smart Clapper.
&amp;quot;Clap it on, clap it off.&amp;quot;</text><text start="58.19" dur="4.438">Oh, it&amp;#39;s a smart outlet
that just listens to clapping,</text><text start="62.661" dur="2.003">which probably seemed
pretty futuristic.</text><text start="64.697" dur="3.771">There&amp;#39;s no software.
There&amp;#39;s no programming.
There&amp;#39;s no apps.</text><text start="68.501" dur="2.869">You plug in this adapter,</text><text start="71.403" dur="2.136">which is huge, by the way,
into the wall.</text><text start="73.572" dur="3.505">&amp;quot;Insert appliance plugs
into clap receptacles.&amp;quot;</text><text start="81.547" dur="2.836">I don&amp;#39;t actually know
where the idea of whole</text><text start="84.416" dur="3.438">clap to turn the light off
thing came from.</text><text start="87.887" dur="1.401">Man:
This is the original.</text><text start="89.321" dur="1.903">This is the original
of that idea?</text><text start="91.257" dur="3.103">Well, that makes this iconic,
doesn&amp;#39;t it?</text><text start="94.393" dur="1.235">We should probably try it.</text><text start="97.53" dur="1.902">So, now...</text><text start="103.602" dur="2.703">That was pretty good.
Not too much delay.</text><text start="106.338" dur="1.435">So, that worked with one,</text><text start="107.806" dur="2.67">but the real promise
is you got two at the same time,</text><text start="110.509" dur="1.902">one for two claps,
one for three.</text><text start="112.444" dur="2.704">So, without any further ado.</text><text start="115.181" dur="2.303">Oh, my God.</text><text start="118.884" dur="1.869">We got a lot of retro tech
in here, clearly.</text><text start="120.786" dur="1.802">This is for the realism.</text><text start="122.621" dur="2.236">So I could plug in
a normal radio,</text><text start="124.89" dur="1.603">but, I mean, come on.</text><text start="127.493" dur="1.935">Okay.</text><text start="129.461" dur="1.803">Let&amp;#39;s say you get home</text><text start="131.297" dur="1.368">and you want to
really impress somebody,</text><text start="132.698" dur="1.802">so everything is off,</text><text start="134.533" dur="3.904">and you don&amp;#39;t even say anything,
you just walk in.</text><text start="138.47" dur="2.003">&amp;quot;Hey, you want
to listen to some music?
Don&amp;#39;t answer that.&amp;quot;</text><text start="142.474" dur="3.971">- ( music plays softly )
- Got you. Turn up.</text><text start="146.478" dur="2.303">That&amp;#39;s-- is that a power move</text><text start="148.814" dur="1.936">or is that just
a nerdy thing to do?</text><text start="150.783" dur="1.735">All right,
so I&amp;#39;m right next to it.</text><text start="152.551" dur="1.636">Let&amp;#39;s go across
the room for a second.</text><text start="160.96" dur="1.302">( laughs )</text><text start="167.6" dur="2.703">Okay, well,
this is just a small slice</text><text start="170.336" dur="3.136">of the whole smart home
experience</text><text start="173.505" dur="1.769">that&amp;#39;s evolved
from these days.</text><text start="175.307" dur="1.969">So I guess the question is,</text><text start="177.309" dur="2.169">how much have
we done since then</text><text start="179.511" dur="1.202">and how far
do we still have to go?</text><text start="180.746" dur="2.636">Let&amp;#39;s just go ahead and explore</text><text start="183.415" dur="1.803">the rest of that pie,
shall we?</text><text start="187.653" dur="2.736">- Welcome to &amp;quot;Retro Tech.&amp;quot;
- Thanks for having me.</text><text start="190.422" dur="1.302">First thing
I&amp;#39;m gonna ask you to do</text><text start="191.757" dur="1.702">is check
underneath your seat.</text><text start="193.492" dur="3.37">- Oh, my goodness.
- Wow.</text><text start="196.895" dur="3.004">- Oh, I remember this.

having a moment right now.</text><text start="201.867" dur="2.57">&amp;quot;Clap on, clap off&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Clap on, clap off.&amp;quot;</text><text start="208.474" dur="2.402">This was the beginning
of our lazy culture.</text><text start="210.909" dur="1.903">Does it still
look like technology?</text><text start="212.845" dur="2.035">No, but, uh,
this was technology</text><text start="214.913" dur="1.869">back in the day, for sure.</text><text start="216.815" dur="1.569">Marques:
I guess, the obvious
first question is</text><text start="218.417" dur="1.168">was there, like, a beginning</text><text start="219.618" dur="3.404">of smart home tech?</text><text start="223.055" dur="1.869">Erica:&lt;i&gt;
 Back in the &amp;#39;50s
 and the &amp;#39;60s,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="224.957" dur="2.403">the middle class
went into the suburbs,</text><text start="227.393" dur="2.402">&lt;i&gt; and it was all about
 time-saving devices&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="229.828" dur="2.537">that were very easy
and simple to use.</text><text start="232.398" dur="2.169">Announcer:
The vacuum cleaner does
a better cleaning job</text><text start="234.6" dur="2.936">on her rugs and furniture
than she could do by hand.</text><text start="237.569" dur="3.404">&lt;i&gt; So now there&amp;#39;s
 a washing machine that will
 do all the laundry,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="241.006" dur="3.437">and you have a dishwasher
that&amp;#39;ll take care of the dishes.</text><text start="244.476" dur="2.403">Erica:&lt;i&gt; The cleaning,
 the washing, the cooking,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="246.912" dur="2.103">they&amp;#39;re the standing-up
activities.</text><text start="249.048" dur="1.935">And the other part of the home</text><text start="251.016" dur="3.538">has to do with the sitting down
part of the experience.</text><text start="256.922" dur="2.837">Announcer:
The outstanding feature
of this color television</text><text start="259.792" dur="3.237">is an amazing new
remote control.</text><text start="263.062" dur="2.402">The remote control
was invented,</text><text start="265.497" dur="2.403">and all of a sudden,
we could kick back on the couch,</text><text start="267.933" dur="2.67">&lt;i&gt;and with one press of a button,
 the television would be on.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="270.636" dur="1.769">A remote control
really kind of boils down</text><text start="272.438" dur="1.602">a lot of the smart home
technologies.</text><text start="274.073" dur="2.669">&lt;i&gt; It&amp;#39;s very convenient
to be able to sit on your couch&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="276.775" dur="2.136">&lt;i&gt; and control
 what&amp;#39;s on your screen.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="278.944" dur="1.469">&lt;i&gt; You use infrared commands,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="280.446" dur="0.968">&lt;i&gt; you could volume up and down,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="281.447" dur="1.335">&lt;i&gt; power, and everything.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="282.815" dur="1.969">And of course,
once that was in the house,</text><text start="284.817" dur="1.702">you never even though
about walking up to the
television again.</text><text start="286.552" dur="1.401">Sam:&lt;i&gt;
 The remote is incredible.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="287.986" dur="1.636">I have back problems,</text><text start="289.655" dur="1.402">and the PT person is like,</text><text start="291.09" dur="1.868">&amp;quot;You have to get up
every 10 minutes.&amp;quot;</text><text start="292.991" dur="1.869">And I&amp;#39;m like,
&amp;quot;Actually, I don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;</text><text start="294.893" dur="1.969">Announcer:
You can operate
all seven functions</text><text start="296.895" dur="2.703">from your easy chair.</text><text start="299.631" dur="2.904">Erica:&lt;i&gt;
 Once we got our hands
 on these remote controls,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="302.568" dur="2.469">we wanted a remote control
for everything.</text><text start="305.07" dur="4.038">Woman: I have a TV remote,
a cable remote, a VCR remote.</text><text start="309.141" dur="1.869">Erica:&lt;i&gt;
 One for a VHS player,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="311.043" dur="2.069">&lt;i&gt; one for our Beta player,
 one for our stereo,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="313.145" dur="2.57">&lt;i&gt; and we were drowning
 in these remote controls.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="315.748" dur="2.803">Steve Wozniak,
the co-founder of Apple,</text><text start="318.584" dur="1.835">&lt;i&gt; believed in
 remote control so much&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="320.452" dur="2.336">that he left Apple
to found a company</text><text start="322.821" dur="3.237">that&amp;#39;s sole purpose was
to develop a new remote control.</text><text start="326.091" dur="3.704">&lt;i&gt; Unfortunately,
 it was really complicated
 and it ultimately failed.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="329.828" dur="2.169">Early technology
suffered from this idea</text><text start="332.03" dur="2.57">&lt;i&gt; that just because
 it was impressive&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="334.633" dur="2.336">&lt;i&gt; or complicated-looking,
 then it was good.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="337.002" dur="3.371">And remote controls
were getting bigger and bigger
and more complicated.</text><text start="340.406" dur="1.668">Sam:&lt;i&gt;
 They made it seem like this
 is tech that we wanted,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="342.107" dur="2.37">but we just want
to turn the volume up.</text><text start="344.51" dur="2.135">That&amp;#39;s it.</text><text start="346.678" dur="2.336">Marques:&lt;i&gt;
 Okay, so, for a minute there,
 remotes got pretty complicated&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="349.047" dur="2.07">&lt;i&gt; before they got simple again.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="351.15" dur="3.67">&lt;i&gt; So, today I&amp;#39;m joined
 by comedian Dulcé Sloan&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="354.853" dur="2.537">&lt;i&gt; and we&amp;#39;re going to test out
 some of these early remotes.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="357.423" dur="3.103">&lt;i&gt; This is Dope or Nope.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="360.559" dur="2.97">All right,
so we&amp;#39;re talking
remote controls.</text><text start="363.562" dur="2.303">Remote control!</text><text start="365.898" dur="2.002">- So, there&amp;#39;s a TV here.
- Cute!</text><text start="367.933" dur="1.802">It looks like a space helmet.</text><text start="369.768" dur="1.168">All right,
first thing we got here,</text><text start="370.969" dur="1.502">it&amp;#39;s about 20 years old.</text><text start="372.504" dur="1.903">Okay. Hmm!</text><text start="374.44" dur="3.036">&amp;quot;inVoca, the world&amp;#39;s most
advanced remote control.&amp;quot;</text><text start="377.509" dur="4.672">Voice activated?
Oh, looks like Alexa
didn&amp;#39;t start the game!</text><text start="382.214" dur="1.835">They&amp;#39;re making
some big claims here.</text><text start="384.082" dur="1.602">&amp;quot;Using technology so advanced</text><text start="385.717" dur="2.904">that it has been used in
interplanetary space probes.&amp;quot;</text><text start="388.654" dur="1.335">( laughs )</text><text start="390.022" dur="1.568">That was a lie in the &amp;#39;90s.</text><text start="391.623" dur="1.869">&amp;quot;This went to space!&amp;quot;</text><text start="393.525" dur="3.404">So, it says first you have
to train it to your voice.</text><text start="396.962" dur="1.135">- Okay.
- All right, step one.</text><text start="398.13" dur="1.735">&amp;quot;Be sure the room is quiet.&amp;quot;</text><text start="399.898" dur="2.236">Shut up! We&amp;#39;re doing
technology ( bleep )!</text><text start="402.167" dur="1.769">- All right.
- Step two.</text><text start="403.969" dur="1.235">Press and release
the &amp;quot;train&amp;quot; button,</text><text start="405.237" dur="2.336">and it&amp;#39;s gonna apparently say,
&amp;quot;Say a word.&amp;quot;</text><text start="407.606" dur="3.537">- Okay.
- Remote:&lt;i&gt; Say a word.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="411.176" dur="1.836">Hello.</text><text start="413.045" dur="2.703">-&lt;i&gt; Press a button. &lt;/i&gt;

 Press another button.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="422.821" dur="2.67">How many more buttons
she want?</text><text start="425.524" dur="1.602">Okay, it will listen
for remote commands</text><text start="427.159" dur="1.935">when the wake-up button
is pressed.</text><text start="429.127" dur="4.639">Okay. Hello. Hello?</text><text start="433.799" dur="1.735">Come on,
that&amp;#39;s gotta be it.</text><text start="435.567" dur="2.47">I&amp;#39;m disappointed,
not gonna lie.</text><text start="438.07" dur="2.403">Hello.</text><text start="442.074" dur="1.502">- Ah!
- Ah, we did it.</text><text start="443.609" dur="2.569">Hallelujah! All right.</text><text start="446.211" dur="1.636">Uh, worth it?</text><text start="447.88" dur="3.337">- Nope.
- I&amp;#39;m with you.</text><text start="451.25" dur="1.935">- Definitely
  way too much work.
- Yes.</text><text start="453.218" dur="1.702">- Definitely doesn&amp;#39;t work
  that well.
- No.</text><text start="454.953" dur="3.704">And definitely not that much
better than pressing the button.</text><text start="458.69" dur="1.269">- Yeah.
- So that&amp;#39;s a nope.</text><text start="459.992" dur="1.235">That&amp;#39;ll make you get divorced.</text><text start="464.263" dur="2.97">All right, this next remote

  you find it.
- Mm-hmm.</text><text start="553.885" dur="2.303">- Downside is this
  is a little bit...
- Cumbersome?</text><text start="556.221" dur="2.069">- It&amp;#39;s a little much.

 So, maybe early
 smart home tech&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="571.803" dur="2.403">&lt;i&gt; wasn&amp;#39;t all that impressive

Thanks, buddy.</text><text start="605.337" dur="2.069">In &amp;quot;Star Trek,&amp;quot;
you had the replicator.</text><text start="607.439" dur="3.27">&lt;i&gt; You could go up to it
 and say...&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="610.742" dur="3.571">Computer, another cup

we want to inhabit,</text><text start="617.382" dur="1.569">but is not quite realistic</text><text start="618.984" dur="2.77">&lt;i&gt; for the technology
 that we actually have.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="621.787" dur="2.002">Those home technologies
of sci-fi movies</text><text start="623.822" dur="1.869">&lt;i&gt; really did start to whet
 our appetite though,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="625.724" dur="2.002">&lt;i&gt; and so we just started
 to seek more and more&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="627.759" dur="3.337">&lt;i&gt; from these devices.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="631.129" dur="2.603">George, this is a program
called Power House.</text><text start="633.765" dur="2.27">It kind of turns your home
into an intelligent home.</text><text start="636.068" dur="3.87">Back in the &amp;#39;70s,
there was something called X-10,</text><text start="639.971" dur="3.271">&lt;i&gt; and it would actually
 use the existing wiring
 in your home.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="643.275" dur="2.669">And there was a control panel
that you could press buttons on.</text><text start="645.977" dur="3.304">&lt;i&gt; You could turn
 on and off lights, a fan,
 things like that.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="649.314" dur="2.703">The issue, of course,
is that you really can&amp;#39;t do
much more than that.</text><text start="652.05" dur="1.936">This was still before wifi,</text><text start="654.019" dur="3.804">&lt;i&gt; so it was all operating
on wiring in the physical home.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="657.856" dur="2.536">When it comes to the creation
of a lot of these technologies,</text><text start="660.425" dur="5.373">there are always gonna be things
that are just too soon.</text><text start="665.831" dur="1.535">Marques:&lt;i&gt;
 So, was it easier to just&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="667.399" dur="1.568">&lt;i&gt; turn on a device yourself?&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="669" dur="2.003">&lt;i&gt; Or did these early
 automated systems&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="671.036" dur="3.737">&lt;i&gt;actually live up to the promise
 of smart home technology?&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="674.806" dur="2.436">&lt;i&gt; Well, today, I&amp;#39;m joined
 by fellow YouTube creator
 Sam Sheffer,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="677.275" dur="3.171">&lt;i&gt; and we&amp;#39;re gonna test out
 some of these systems
 to see for ourselves.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="680.479" dur="2.869">- Sam, thanks for joining me
  on &amp;quot;Retro Tech. &amp;quot;
- Of course.</text><text start="683.381" dur="2.87">I&amp;#39;ve heard of a lot of tech,
but I&amp;#39;ve never heard of X-10.</text><text start="686.284" dur="4.705">I&amp;#39;m curious, like,
what this tech from the &amp;#39;80s
sort of looked like.</text><text start="691.022" dur="4.706">Okay, Marques,
this is the OG
of the X-10 system.</text><text start="695.761" dur="3.737">So, this is Radio Shack&amp;#39;s
plug and power
remote control center.</text><text start="699.531" dur="2.269">So, these things
are the modules.</text><text start="701.833" dur="1.636">You plug an appliance
into here,</text><text start="703.502" dur="1.902">then these plug into the wall,</text><text start="705.437" dur="2.87">and this is how
you control everything.</text><text start="708.34" dur="1.435">- All right.
- So, picture this.</text><text start="709.808" dur="2.336">Young Marques
in early &amp;#39;80s.</text><text start="712.177" dur="2.036">All right,
I&amp;#39;m gonna put myself
back in the &amp;#39;80s.</text><text start="714.246" dur="1.502">Cue the recreation.</text><text start="717.449" dur="1.602">Scott:&lt;i&gt;
 Okay, so, Marques,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="719.084" dur="1.101">&lt;i&gt; imagine you&amp;#39;ve just come home&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="720.218" dur="1.636">&lt;i&gt; from a long day at school.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="721.887" dur="2.369">&lt;i&gt; You&amp;#39;re downright exhausted.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="724.289" dur="2.203">&lt;i&gt; Now, you could get up
 and turn on the lights,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="726.525" dur="2.903">&lt;i&gt; the toaster,
 popcorn machine, TV,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="729.461" dur="3.037">&lt;i&gt; and maybe even
 turn on your vacuum.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="732.531" dur="5.239">&lt;i&gt; Or you could
 just turn one one button.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="737.803" dur="3.938">&lt;i&gt; Which would you choose?&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="749.08" dur="1.803">Now, that-- that was good.
That was good.</text><text start="750.916" dur="1.501">That was, uh, powerful.</text><text start="752.45" dur="2.437">It feels impressive in a way</text><text start="754.92" dur="1.301">in the tech world of the &amp;#39;80s,</text><text start="756.254" dur="2.937">to do one thing
and have several things happen.</text><text start="759.224" dur="2.002">Okay, so what&amp;#39;s next?</text><text start="761.259" dur="1.602">Okay, so this thing
is called</text><text start="762.894" dur="2.503">the Master Voice
Butler-In-A-Box.</text><text start="765.43" dur="5.005">It is the first

-&lt;i&gt; Okay, master.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="778.476" dur="1.536">Also, around the back,</text><text start="780.045" dur="2.503">you actually have
a phone jack in here.</text><text start="782.581" dur="4.304">So this thing can actually
connect to your landline.</text><text start="786.918" dur="3.137">So, what sort of scenario
would this be useful for?</text><text start="790.088" dur="3.237">So, Marques, picture this. 1986.</text><text start="793.358" dur="4.505">&lt;i&gt; You&amp;#39;re at home,
 you just made yourself
 a delicious sandwich&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="797.896" dur="2.036">&lt;i&gt; and you&amp;#39;re really

bleeding-edge tech experience</text><text start="842.507" dur="2.103">where we just know
it&amp;#39;s not ready yet,</text><text start="844.643" dur="2.669">and I feel like that
was that experience.</text><text start="847.345" dur="3.638">Yeah, but it&amp;#39;s kind
of hard to imagine, like,
wow, this came out in 1986.</text><text start="851.016" dur="2.135">Yeah. To an extent,
I am impressed.</text><text start="853.184" dur="1.969">Drawing a straight line
to what we have today,</text><text start="855.186" dur="2.37">and what we&amp;#39;re looking forward
to in the future, this is it.</text><text start="857.589" dur="2.87">This is what we want.
An assistant.</text><text start="860.492" dur="1.668">So what we&amp;#39;re doing now
with the Internet</text><text start="862.193" dur="3.337">is creating a home network
the same way X-10,</text><text start="865.563" dur="5.44">technically, through
all the wires in our house,
was a network.</text><text start="871.036" dur="1.602">&lt;i&gt; So, maybe the X-10 system&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="872.671" dur="2.736">&lt;i&gt; didn&amp;#39;t make our homes
 all that much smarter.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="875.44" dur="3.103">&lt;i&gt; But true smart home technology
 was just around the corner,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="878.576" dur="1.703">&lt;i&gt; thanks to
 a little thing called...&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="880.312" dur="1.702">The Internet.</text><text start="882.047" dur="2.569">When we finally got Internet
and wifi in our homes,</text><text start="884.649" dur="3.371">that really opened up the world
of smart home innovation.</text><text start="888.053" dur="3.237">&lt;i&gt; Because instead of just
 having smart devices,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="891.323" dur="3.036">&lt;i&gt; you had smart devices

of smart home tech?</text><text start="931.096" dur="2.97">The promise
of technology in the home</text><text start="934.099" dur="1.969">was that it
was going to make us</text><text start="936.101" dur="2.069">more effective,
more efficient.</text><text start="938.203" dur="2.803">&lt;i&gt; Everything would be more
 convenient and simpler.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="941.039" dur="2.103">And we finally

- So, you wrote a book
  about 25-odd years ago</text><text start="1000.565" dur="2.903">&lt;i&gt; called &amp;quot;The Road Ahead,&amp;quot;
 in which you made&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1003.501" dur="3.271">&lt;i&gt; a bunch of impressively
 accurate predictions
 about our future.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1006.805" dur="3.67">I&amp;#39;m curious how
your vision of smart homes
over the years,</text><text start="1010.508" dur="2.803">over the last 30 years
or so has changed,</text><text start="1013.344" dur="2.303">and specifically
how climate change</text><text start="1015.68" dur="1.936">has wrapped more and more
into that picture?</text><text start="1017.649" dur="2.002">A lot of what we talked about
in those early days</text><text start="1019.684" dur="2.503">was various home automation
type things.</text><text start="1022.22" dur="3.003">Announcer: As Robin enters,
she just touches &amp;quot;Welcome Home&amp;quot;</text><text start="1025.256" dur="1.402">on the nearest wall panel</text><text start="1026.691" dur="2.103">so the house is set
just the way she likes it.</text><text start="1028.827" dur="2.97">Gates:&lt;i&gt; The temperature
 would automatically adjust,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1031.83" dur="1.835">&lt;i&gt; the lights, you know,
 would turn off&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1033.698" dur="1.802">&lt;i&gt; when they weren&amp;#39;t needed.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1035.533" dur="3.137">And part of that was
optimizing energy usage,</text><text start="1038.703" dur="2.47">that, you know,
you wouldn&amp;#39;t have lights on</text><text start="1041.206" dur="2.135">or be heating or cooling spaces</text><text start="1043.374" dur="2.203">unless it was
absolutely necessary.</text><text start="1045.61" dur="3.804">&lt;i&gt; You want the digital ability
 to control those things&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1049.447" dur="3.17">&lt;i&gt; and to understand where
 you&amp;#39;re using electricity.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1052.65" dur="2.003">That still hasn&amp;#39;t happened.</text><text start="1054.686" dur="3.67">The home control
is still to be rolled out</text><text start="1058.389" dur="1.803">as something
that&amp;#39;s simple and cheap.</text><text start="1060.225" dur="2.135">Do you think that
sort of stuff is something</text><text start="1062.393" dur="1.235">we should be shooting
towards more?</text><text start="1063.661" dur="3.204">Like, specifically
helping ourselves</text><text start="1066.898" dur="2.203">and the environment
at the same time?</text><text start="1069.134" dur="4.037">Yeah, for most houses,
the big use of electricity</text><text start="1073.204" dur="1.636">is the heating and cooling.</text><text start="1074.873" dur="3.337">Right now, that meter,
which most people</text><text start="1078.243" dur="2.87">&lt;i&gt; don&amp;#39;t go out and look at,
 it doesn&amp;#39;t do a what-if?&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1081.146" dur="1.702">What if I insulated the attic?</text><text start="1082.881" dur="4.471">What if, you know, I turned down
from 72 degrees to 70 degrees?</text><text start="1087.385" dur="4.438">&lt;i&gt; If you bring that
 into the digital realm
 on your PC or phone,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1091.856" dur="2.737">then you can attribute
the different loads</text><text start="1094.626" dur="2.936">to different activities,
and with a good UI,</text><text start="1097.595" dur="3.271">set the policy
so you&amp;#39;re doing your part</text><text start="1100.899" dur="2.736">as somebody who cares
about climate change.</text><text start="1103.668" dur="2.903">How do we get to a future</text><text start="1106.604" dur="2.904">where it&amp;#39;s not just
a couple of smart homes</text><text start="1109.541" dur="3.87">sprinkled in our neighborhoods
that are high efficiency,</text><text start="1113.444" dur="4.205">but whole smart cities,
smart states,</text><text start="1117.682" dur="2.837">that are hyper-efficient
and energy positive?</text><text start="1120.552" dur="2.035">Well, often this gets pioneered</text><text start="1122.62" dur="1.803">when you have
a new development.</text><text start="1126.758" dur="4.138">&lt;i&gt; In America, houses are big,
 and that&amp;#39;s a lot of energy.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1130.929" dur="2.736">&lt;i&gt; And we want to move that
 from natural gas,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1133.698" dur="2.937">&lt;i&gt; which has carbon emissions,
 to electricity.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1136.668" dur="2.97">And there&amp;#39;s a thing
called the heat pump that&amp;#39;s
actually fairly cheap.</text><text start="1139.671" dur="3.237">&lt;i&gt; In fact, amazingly,
 some houses can switch&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1142.941" dur="2.97">&lt;i&gt; and buy this heat pump
 and replace their natural gas,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1145.944" dur="2.236">&lt;i&gt; and actually
 end up saving money.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1148.213" dur="1.969">Obviously, if you have
the intelligence</text><text start="1150.215" dur="1.668">&lt;i&gt; on all the different houses&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1151.916" dur="2.536">&lt;i&gt; controlling when you&amp;#39;re
 using electricity,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1154.485" dur="1.969">&lt;i&gt; like, &amp;quot;Hey, turn
 all the lights off,&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1156.487" dur="2.804">&lt;i&gt; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going on vacation
 for two weeks,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1159.324" dur="2.469">&lt;i&gt; do the right thing,&amp;quot;
 you know, it has to be smart.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1161.826" dur="1.669">&lt;i&gt; We don&amp;#39;t have that yet.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1163.528" dur="3.17">So I think you will see
new developments</text><text start="1166.731" dur="2.102">where they&amp;#39;re trying
to market themselves</text><text start="1168.866" dur="2.47">as, you know,
city of the future type thing</text><text start="1171.369" dur="3.437">&lt;i&gt; because we need pioneers
 to, you know,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1174.839" dur="2.803">see how this
can all come together.</text><text start="1177.675" dur="2.67">So, as far as visions
for the future,</text><text start="1180.378" dur="2.57">we might be closer
to a smart home</text><text start="1182.981" dur="1.568">than anything else
we&amp;#39;ve talked about.</text><text start="1184.582" dur="1.902">The real challenge
is gonna be getting people</text><text start="1186.517" dur="2.804">to adopt this future--
more than just a few.</text><text start="1189.354" dur="2.336">I think the sweet spot
is somewhere in between</text><text start="1191.723" dur="4.238">the Clapper and its simplicity
and ease of use and convenience,</text><text start="1195.994" dur="2.603">and the Nest, Sense,
smart windows of the world.</text><text start="1198.63" dur="1.702">But then, once we&amp;#39;re there,
we can move forward</text><text start="1200.365" dur="4.238">into this sci-fi smart home
future we&amp;#39;ve been waiting for.</text><text start="1204.636" dur="2.336">Either way, that&amp;#39;s been it.
Thanks for watching.</text><text start="1207.005" dur="2.469">Catch you guys
on the next one. Peace.</text></transcript>
