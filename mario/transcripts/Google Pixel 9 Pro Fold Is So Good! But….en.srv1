<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="3.3">(upbeat music)</text><text start="3.3" dur="1.23">- All right, so first thing I did</text><text start="4.53" dur="1.59">when I got back from Australia was start</text><text start="6.12" dur="1.173">to catch up on the stuff that I missed.</text><text start="7.293" dur="4.257">And I put my SIM card in the Pixel Fold,</text><text start="11.55" dur="5">the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and
I was impressed, really.</text><text start="16.56" dur="1.92">Maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t have been so impressed</text><text start="18.48" dur="2.295">given how good the other
Pixel 9s already are.</text><text start="20.775" dur="3.705">But it&amp;#39;s a folding phone,
folding phones are hard,</text><text start="24.48" dur="2.22">but the second generation
of anything tells you a lot.</text><text start="26.7" dur="1.5">And even though this is called</text><text start="28.2" dur="3.48">the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it&amp;#39;s the second one.</text><text start="31.68" dur="2.61">The first Pixel Fold is
last year and it was solid.</text><text start="34.29" dur="2.49">It was one of my favorite
foldables to use closed</text><text start="36.78" dur="2.37">with that passport style aspect ratio,</text><text start="39.15" dur="2.34">but it had a number of
trade-offs with its price.</text><text start="41.49" dur="2.97">This one makes some big strides forward.</text><text start="44.46" dur="2.31">So let me just start with the design.</text><text start="46.77" dur="2.37">Like there was a lot of
chatter about this camera bump</text><text start="49.14" dur="1.77">on the back just &amp;#39;cause
of the way it looks,</text><text start="50.91" dur="1.74">which is, yeah, it&amp;#39;s kind of weird.</text><text start="52.65" dur="1.65">But personally this hasn&amp;#39;t bothered me.</text><text start="54.3" dur="2.28">It&amp;#39;s not like the biggest wobbler.</text><text start="56.58" dur="2.52">I wish it was wider like the other Pixels,</text><text start="59.1" dur="2.88">I wish it looked more consistent
like the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro,</text><text start="61.98" dur="1.74">but you don&amp;#39;t have to look at it much.</text><text start="63.72" dur="0.833">I&amp;#39;m guessing it looks like this just</text><text start="64.553" dur="2.467">&amp;#39;cause of the complicated
internals of a folding phone.</text><text start="67.02" dur="1.17">But then the rest of the design</text><text start="68.19" dur="2.34">around this thing is pretty nice.</text><text start="70.53" dur="1.98">It is much thinner, first of all,</text><text start="72.51" dur="2.37">and they&amp;#39;ve flattened the
sides all the way around.</text><text start="74.88" dur="2.22">So it&amp;#39;s this more modern
like squared off shape</text><text start="77.1" dur="1.17">a lot of other flagships have.</text><text start="78.27" dur="2.16">Now, the funny thing is the rounded sides</text><text start="80.43" dur="1.86">from last year were actually easier</text><text start="82.29" dur="2.01">to just pry open for a folding phone.</text><text start="84.3" dur="2.67">So you&amp;#39;ll notice that if you
use both phones back to back,</text><text start="86.97" dur="1.5">but this isn&amp;#39;t the end of the world.</text><text start="88.47" dur="2.85">And then, there&amp;#39;s a bunch
of other refinements too.</text><text start="91.32" dur="1.83">The hinge is a bit smaller.</text><text start="93.15" dur="3.75">The sides are now sort of
matte finish instead of glossy.</text><text start="96.9" dur="2.73">So now, you have matte
sides and a soft touch back.</text><text start="99.63" dur="2.28">And overall, it just feels much closer</text><text start="101.91" dur="2.4">to a normal slab when it&amp;#39;s closed.</text><text start="104.31" dur="2.25">It&amp;#39;s not fully there, like
we&amp;#39;re not quite fooling</text><text start="106.56" dur="1.8">anybody yet, but it&amp;#39;s a little</text><text start="108.36" dur="2.13">over 10 millimeters thick folded</text><text start="110.49" dur="1.5">and there are a lot of other phones</text><text start="111.99" dur="1.86">from the past year that
are around that number.</text><text start="113.85" dur="1.74">The main change though
definitely is that it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="115.59" dur="3.45">that smaller passport size anymore.</text><text start="119.04" dur="3.78">This is a full on like
maxed out flagship size,</text><text start="122.82" dur="5">6.3 inch, 1080p, dynamic
120 hertz AmLED display.</text><text start="128.04" dur="3.75">It&amp;#39;s big, the last one was
more reachable, for sure.</text><text start="131.79" dur="2.52">Now it&amp;#39;s much more like
the OnePlus Open sized.</text><text start="134.31" dur="2.82">So it&amp;#39;s right around the maximum</text><text start="137.13" dur="1.53">of actually being able to use</text><text start="138.66" dur="1.74">the whole screen with one hand.</text><text start="140.4" dur="1.44">I mean your mileage may vary of course,</text><text start="141.84" dur="1.8">depending on the size of your hands.</text><text start="143.64" dur="3.18">But yeah, there&amp;#39;s also still real bezels</text><text start="146.82" dur="1.89">all the way around the screen
and it kind of pushes it</text><text start="148.71" dur="2.25">away from the hinge so
it&amp;#39;s a little off center.</text><text start="150.96" dur="2.16">But in general, I still
find it very usable</text><text start="153.12" dur="2.19">and it just feels more
like a regular phone</text><text start="155.31" dur="2.04">than ever before, which I think is a win.</text><text start="157.35" dur="1.14">I really like this cover screen.</text><text start="158.49" dur="2.4">And then when you open it
up, that&amp;#39;s when the benefits</text><text start="160.89" dur="2.34">of being taller really start to pay off</text><text start="163.23" dur="2.1">&amp;#39;cause now you go from a 7.6 inch screen</text><text start="165.33" dur="4.35">to a slightly narrower
but taller 8 inch screen</text><text start="169.68" dur="1.98">that&amp;#39;s basically now a square.</text><text start="171.66" dur="3.09">And the screen is way
better, it&amp;#39;s up to 2700 nits.</text><text start="174.75" dur="1.26">It&amp;#39;s nice and bright.</text><text start="176.01" dur="2.67">It is actually LTPO when the cover screen</text><text start="178.68" dur="2.52">is not, for some reason and the bezels</text><text start="181.2" dur="2.37">have tremendously improved
from the first folding Pixel.</text><text start="183.57" dur="2.13">So they&amp;#39;re still a little thick, sure,</text><text start="185.7" dur="2.535">but now they&amp;#39;re nicely
even all the way around</text><text start="188.235" dur="2.055">and there&amp;#39;s a whole punch
cutout in the corner now</text><text start="190.29" dur="2.28">instead of the selfie
camera on the thick bezel.</text><text start="192.57" dur="3.27">And just look how thin that is.</text><text start="195.84" dur="2.58">Like it&amp;#39;s barely thicker
than the USB C port.</text><text start="198.42" dur="2.16">This would&amp;#39;ve been a crazy sentence</text><text start="200.58" dur="3.33">just a few short years
ago, but using this phone</text><text start="203.91" dur="3.45">I wager almost everything about</text><text start="207.36" dur="4.56">the hardware of this Google phone is</text><text start="211.92" dur="3.45">at or above average, which is crazy.</text><text start="215.37" dur="1.83">It&amp;#39;s like the harder the part is to make</text><text start="217.2" dur="2.55">the better and more
above average they are.</text><text start="219.75" dur="1.71">Like this new hinge is nice and smooth</text><text start="221.46" dur="2.79">and the phone opens and closes
in a really satisfying way</text><text start="224.25" dur="2.58">and it unfolds all the way flat easily,</text><text start="226.83" dur="1.65">unlike last year&amp;#39;s phone.</text><text start="228.48" dur="2.52">The crease through the
middle is, you know,</text><text start="231" dur="2.28">average at worst, but
very easy to look past</text><text start="233.28" dur="1.83">when you&amp;#39;re actually looking
at content on the screen.</text><text start="235.11" dur="3.21">And they fit in a 4650
milliampere-hour battery inside,</text><text start="238.32" dur="2.46">which again is a little
above average for foldables,</text><text start="240.78" dur="2.7">even though it&amp;#39;s actually
slightly less than last year.</text><text start="243.48" dur="3.66">The speakers in this thin
body are very good and full.</text><text start="247.14" dur="2.58">The water resistance is here, it&amp;#39;s IPX8.</text><text start="249.72" dur="2.85">The flatter fingerprint reader
is easy and quick and fast.</text><text start="252.57" dur="4.02">And just this hardware feels actually</text><text start="256.59" dur="1.89">more deserving of the
word pro than ever before.</text><text start="258.48" dur="1.47">So you know, they renamed the phone,</text><text start="259.95" dur="1.05">it has pro in the name now,</text><text start="261" dur="1.53">but it feels like it deserves it.</text><text start="262.53" dur="2.31">But also little things
like the outer display</text><text start="264.84" dur="3.12">not being LTPO feel weird considering</text><text start="267.96" dur="2.22">that&amp;#39;s the one that does
the always on thing.</text><text start="270.18" dur="2.67">That&amp;#39;s the one you really want to be LTPO.</text><text start="272.85" dur="2.37">And it also doesn&amp;#39;t
charge particularly fast</text><text start="275.22" dur="2.19">and there&amp;#39;s no Qi2 so the phone has</text><text start="277.41" dur="2.25">this lower than normal
wireless charging coil</text><text start="279.66" dur="1.65">that can be kind of annoying to line up</text><text start="281.31" dur="1.98">and doesn&amp;#39;t work on certain chargers,</text><text start="283.29" dur="2.1">which may feel like nitpicking</text><text start="285.39" dur="2.31">but hey, when it&amp;#39;s an $1800 phone,</text><text start="287.7" dur="1.71">you are definitely allowed to nitpick.</text><text start="289.41" dur="1.05">Overall though, design wise,</text><text start="290.46" dur="2.4">I really feel like they
got a lot of stuff right.</text><text start="292.86" dur="2.91">So yeah, it reminds me of the
OnePlus Open from last year,</text><text start="295.77" dur="2.67">which won my best folding
phone of the year.</text><text start="298.44" dur="2.7">But then this one is a Pixel</text><text start="301.14" dur="2.79">and this Pixel software
experience ends up being</text><text start="303.93" dur="1.83">what differentiates it over a lot</text><text start="305.76" dur="2.4">of other folding phone options out there</text><text start="308.16" dur="2.94">because yeah, there are
totally more flashy foldables</text><text start="311.1" dur="3.21">with more advanced hardware
from Vivo and Xiaomi</text><text start="314.31" dur="1.38">and there&amp;#39;s these razor thin pieces</text><text start="315.69" dur="1.89">of hardware with head turning specs.</text><text start="317.58" dur="1.65">But if I&amp;#39;m being honest, the software</text><text start="319.23" dur="2.7">on those typically isn&amp;#39;t nearly as good.</text><text start="321.93" dur="2.97">So here you basically
have all the same features</text><text start="324.9" dur="3.27">as the rest of the Pixel 9
flagship lineup, which is great.</text><text start="328.17" dur="2.97">It&amp;#39;s call screening, it&amp;#39;s
the Pixel weather app,</text><text start="331.14" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s all the new stuff
basically, everything except</text><text start="334.59" dur="2.28">the thermometer app and that&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="336.87" dur="1.56">So Gemini is actually getting good,</text><text start="338.43" dur="1.98">like I said in the 9 review,</text><text start="340.41" dur="2.1">and I&amp;#39;m still loving circle to search,</text><text start="342.51" dur="2.31">although on this inner
screen you gotta be slightly</text><text start="344.82" dur="2.07">more careful because the slight difference</text><text start="346.89" dur="2.67">between hold to circle to search</text><text start="349.56" dur="2.28">and the tiny swipe to bring up the dock</text><text start="351.84" dur="1.92">can kind of take some getting used to.</text><text start="353.76" dur="2.67">But then there&amp;#39;s also all of
the foldable optimizations,</text><text start="356.43" dur="2.58">the two column layouts for
so many pieces of Android,</text><text start="359.01" dur="2.31">the notifications, the settings app,</text><text start="361.32" dur="1.59">so many other first party apps.</text><text start="362.91" dur="1.5">And I&amp;#39;ve just been generally loving</text><text start="364.41" dur="2.493">the larger size screen because
it feels like multitasking</text><text start="366.903" dur="2.007">and having multiple apps open at once.</text><text start="368.91" dur="2.07">Or specifically something I do a lot,</text><text start="370.98" dur="1.56">which is picture in picture with</text><text start="372.54" dur="2.61">a small YouTube video window
somewhere on the screen,</text><text start="375.15" dur="1.86">but I&amp;#39;m reading an article
or doing something else</text><text start="377.01" dur="2.4">in a full-size window, all of that</text><text start="379.41" dur="1.53">is better on this phone than last year.</text><text start="380.94" dur="2.49">And this is all Android
14, which is the same</text><text start="383.43" dur="3.51">as all the other new Pixels,
but I put Android 15 beta</text><text start="386.94" dur="2.07">on my old Pixel Fold and there are</text><text start="389.01" dur="3.03">some more folding
optimizations that&amp;#39;s just...</text><text start="392.04" dur="3.69">It&amp;#39;s hopefully, coming soon
and they promise seven years</text><text start="395.73" dur="3.96">of software updates on Pixel
9s, which is pretty elite.</text><text start="399.69" dur="1.65">So I&amp;#39;ve said a lot of nice
things about this phone,</text><text start="401.34" dur="2.61">but going into this before I
even put my SIM card in it,</text><text start="403.95" dur="1.32">&amp;#39;cause I&amp;#39;d read other people&amp;#39;s coverage</text><text start="405.27" dur="2.01">and seen stuff about this phone is I knew</text><text start="407.28" dur="2.4">that there would be
basically two main downsides</text><text start="409.68" dur="2.43">to look out for, to keep an eye on.</text><text start="412.11" dur="3.81">And those are the Tensor
chip being underpowered</text><text start="415.92" dur="2.34">and the downgraded camera system.</text><text start="418.26" dur="2.82">So, okay, it&amp;#39;s a Pixel, let&amp;#39;s
just start with the cameras.</text><text start="421.08" dur="3.27">Basically, my findings are, yes,</text><text start="424.35" dur="3.27">they are smaller sensors
than the main Pixels</text><text start="427.62" dur="2.91">and yes, they are worse,
but they&amp;#39;re not horrible.</text><text start="430.53" dur="2.58">Like they&amp;#39;re not that much worse
that it&amp;#39;s a bad camera now.</text><text start="433.11" dur="3.39">Basically, you can see the
style of the photos is the same</text><text start="436.5" dur="2.79">and it&amp;#39;s contrasty,
it&amp;#39;s high dynamic range,</text><text start="439.29" dur="2.37">but it&amp;#39;s not as sharp
is my main observation.</text><text start="441.66" dur="2.91">And this gets exaggerated
as the conditions get worse.</text><text start="444.57" dur="2.85">So in lower light the photos get softer</text><text start="447.42" dur="3.03">and lack details faster
as these smaller sensors</text><text start="450.45" dur="1.38">start to fight for light more.</text><text start="451.83" dur="2.1">So it feels on par with
like a Pixel flagship,</text><text start="453.93" dur="2.64">but from a few years
ago, like a Pixel 7 Pro.</text><text start="456.57" dur="1.77">Now that&amp;#39;s about it and that&amp;#39;s always been</text><text start="458.34" dur="3.66">one of the compromises of
these high-end folding phones</text><text start="462" dur="2.28">is, you know, they give you
all the software features</text><text start="464.28" dur="3.96">of the other phones, but for 17, $1800</text><text start="468.24" dur="1.71">you would also hope for
the maximum quality,</text><text start="469.95" dur="2.76">but they can&amp;#39;t fit all of
the same camera sensors</text><text start="472.71" dur="2.04">in a phone that has
all this other hardware</text><text start="474.75" dur="1.26">and a hinge and everything like that.</text><text start="476.01" dur="2.1">So if you take a lot of pictures</text><text start="478.11" dur="3.03">and you&amp;#39;re into phones
specifically for that,</text><text start="481.14" dur="1.77">that might be a tough pill to swallow.</text><text start="482.91" dur="2.49">But if you&amp;#39;re not, if you
buy it for other reasons</text><text start="485.4" dur="1.29">and you&amp;#39;re not a huge camera person,</text><text start="486.69" dur="1.86">then you may be willing to overlook that.</text><text start="488.55" dur="1.56">Me, personally, I rely too much on photos</text><text start="490.11" dur="1.86">and videos from my phone,
so that&amp;#39;s tough for me.</text><text start="491.97" dur="4.77">But the other downside
is this Tensor chip,</text><text start="496.74" dur="1.68">and this is another nuanced one.</text><text start="498.42" dur="2.82">See, Google&amp;#39;s Tensor chip has never been</text><text start="501.24" dur="3.24">best in its class power-wise
or efficiency-wise.</text><text start="504.48" dur="2.79">I&amp;#39;d argue it&amp;#39;s been good enough
for the phones it&amp;#39;s been in.</text><text start="507.27" dur="2.76">But if you wanted to
do like high-end gaming</text><text start="510.03" dur="2.28">or if you wanted a really
extended shelf life</text><text start="512.31" dur="1.26">for more than a few years</text><text start="513.57" dur="1.8">or really amazing battery life,</text><text start="515.37" dur="2.64">like Tensor is holding these phones back.</text><text start="518.01" dur="1.5">And so, people have been
trying to figure out,</text><text start="519.51" dur="2.4">all right, when is
Google going to catch up</text><text start="521.91" dur="4.41">and get on par with like the
Qualcomm level flagship chips</text><text start="526.32" dur="4.05">and the Tensor G4 in the
Pixel 9 line of phones,</text><text start="530.37" dur="2.4">including this phone, is solid</text><text start="532.77" dur="1.89">and it&amp;#39;s paired with 16
gigs of RAM in this phone,</text><text start="534.66" dur="2.28">which is awesome and obviously
helps with the AI models,</text><text start="536.94" dur="2.01">but also running the rest of the phone.</text><text start="538.95" dur="2.97">But it&amp;#39;s not amazing and
it really makes you wonder</text><text start="541.92" dur="2.31">like, okay, it&amp;#39;s promised seven
years of software updates,</text><text start="544.23" dur="2.52">but will the phone last that long?</text><text start="546.75" dur="1.08">Like these are real questions.</text><text start="547.83" dur="4.77">But word on the street is
next gen, next Tensor chip,</text><text start="552.6" dur="2.82">allegedly, maybe is gonna be the one</text><text start="555.42" dur="2.16">that finally goes from being designed</text><text start="557.58" dur="2.31">by Google and manufactured by Samsung</text><text start="559.89" dur="3.18">to the first fully custom Google chip</text><text start="563.07" dur="2.55">with three nanometers and everything.</text><text start="565.62" dur="2.91">And that could be the
huge jump that this needs.</text><text start="568.53" dur="1.29">That could be a big power jump,</text><text start="569.82" dur="3.51">a big efficiency jump,
but that&amp;#39;s just a rumor.</text><text start="573.33" dur="2.07">So I would say that if you hear that</text><text start="575.4" dur="2.49">and get excited about that
which, let&amp;#39;s be honest,</text><text start="577.89" dur="3.42">a lot of the customer base
for a $2,000 folding phone</text><text start="581.31" dur="1.38">actually does care about that stuff</text><text start="582.69" dur="3">then, you should probably wait.</text><text start="585.69" dur="1.5">I actually feel like you should wait.</text><text start="587.19" dur="2.4">And it&amp;#39;s weird to say
that this is both one</text><text start="589.59" dur="1.86">of the best folding phones I&amp;#39;ve ever used</text><text start="591.45" dur="1.89">and you should probably wait just</text><text start="593.34" dur="1.62">because you don&amp;#39;t wanna spend this much</text><text start="594.96" dur="1.83">and then regret your purchase next year.</text><text start="596.79" dur="1.95">But if that doesn&amp;#39;t
speak to you, honestly,</text><text start="598.74" dur="3.9">this phone as it exists
today, it feels great.</text><text start="602.64" dur="3.21">It looks great, it&amp;#39;s
smooth, the battery life,</text><text start="605.85" dur="3.24">for me, is consistently like
six hours of screen on time</text><text start="609.09" dur="1.83">with mostly small screen activities,</text><text start="610.92" dur="2.67">but then the sort of 10% of the time</text><text start="613.59" dur="3.9">that I actually open it and
do a lot more big screen use,</text><text start="617.49" dur="1.71">then you can eat into
the battery a bit more.</text><text start="619.2" dur="3.9">But I just feel like I am
productive when I have this phone.</text><text start="623.1" dur="1.71">Like it really does accomplish the goal</text><text start="624.81" dur="2.64">of feeling like I have two phones,</text><text start="627.45" dur="2.82">the regular size flagship
when it&amp;#39;s closed,</text><text start="630.27" dur="2.91">and then the mini tablet
ready to go at any time</text><text start="633.18" dur="2.7">for the multi column
layouts, the multitasking</text><text start="635.88" dur="2.37">and big productivity
apps, for all that stuff</text><text start="638.25" dur="1.92">that I really sit down and get stuff done</text><text start="640.17" dur="2.52">on my phone for, this
thing has been awesome.</text><text start="642.69" dur="2.58">Oh, and also speaking of
ready to go at any time,</text><text start="645.27" dur="2.64">I just wanted to shout out
that the new Ridge Wallet</text><text start="647.91" dur="1.62">that I designed is finally here</text><text start="649.53" dur="3.99">and it is a full grain leather
soft wallet and it&amp;#39;s sick.</text><text start="653.52" dur="4.02">RFID blocking, lightweight,
two pockets with easy access.</text><text start="657.54" dur="1.98">You can kind of just pop
&amp;#39;em up from the front</text><text start="659.52" dur="2.34">or use your finger to glide
them up from the back.</text><text start="661.86" dur="1.59">Fits up to around eight cards.</text><text start="663.45" dur="2.37">You could put cash in
it, if you want to also.</text><text start="665.82" dur="2.25">It&amp;#39;s everything you need
and nothing you don&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="668.07" dur="1.5">I&amp;#39;ll link it below if
you wanna check it out.</text><text start="669.57" dur="0.93">I&amp;#39;m really proud of it.</text><text start="670.5" dur="1.819">But yeah, look, if you&amp;#39;re
not a foldable person,</text><text start="672.319" dur="3.281">then this phone may not convince you.</text><text start="675.6" dur="1.53">Like it&amp;#39;s the same dimensions,</text><text start="677.13" dur="1.77">the same functionality, roughly.</text><text start="678.9" dur="3.36">Like it&amp;#39;s not a game
changer, by any means.</text><text start="682.26" dur="2.1">But if you are a foldable person,</text><text start="684.36" dur="1.56">this phone has been awesome to use.</text><text start="685.92" dur="1.53">Like I&amp;#39;ve really enjoyed the fact</text><text start="687.45" dur="4.2">that it really feels like a
full on flagship on the front</text><text start="691.65" dur="2.91">and feels like a mini
tablet when I want one.</text><text start="694.56" dur="3.15">Two phones in one, that&amp;#39;s the
ideal foldable phone for me.</text><text start="697.71" dur="4.35">And yeah, this is my favorite
flagship foldable ever</text><text start="702.06" dur="2.61">to come out so there you have it.</text><text start="704.67" dur="1.71">Hopefully, Android 15 soon.</text><text start="706.38" dur="2.7">Thanks for watching, catch
