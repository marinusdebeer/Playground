<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.017" dur="3.103">(logo whirring)</text><text start="3.12" dur="0.833">- Hey, what&amp;#39;s up?</text><text start="3.953" dur="0.833">MKBHD here.</text><text start="4.786" dur="2.564">So this little machine,
this one right here,</text><text start="7.35" dur="2.52">that I can hold in my hands,</text><text start="9.87" dur="4.23">has more power than a
base Mac Pro right now,</text><text start="14.1" dur="1.71">more CPU power anyway.</text><text start="15.81" dur="2.52">Now, I hope that that&amp;#39;s
not true for much longer,</text><text start="18.33" dur="1.89">because the Mac Pro is overdue</text><text start="20.22" dur="1.44">for its Apple Silicon upgrade.</text><text start="21.66" dur="1.89">But the fact that it&amp;#39;s
true at all right now</text><text start="23.55" dur="1.941">is absolutely insane.</text><text start="25.491" dur="2.769">This little machine is
not only super powerful,</text><text start="28.26" dur="3.27">and super efficient, and super small,</text><text start="31.53" dur="2.88">but it&amp;#39;s also a really good price.</text><text start="34.41" dur="2.184">So I said in my last video
about the MacBook Pros</text><text start="36.594" dur="3.246">that the Mac mini is actually
the more interesting machine.</text><text start="39.84" dur="1.35">And I mean it, it really is.</text><text start="41.19" dur="1.136">It&amp;#39;s just gotten a refresh</text><text start="42.326" dur="2.494">from the M1 chip that it had before</text><text start="44.82" dur="3.81">to now having an M2, and an M2 Pro option,</text><text start="48.63" dur="2.49">both of which are kind of game
changers in their own ways.</text><text start="51.12" dur="1.29">So first, the M2 version,</text><text start="52.41" dur="3.06">the base M2 Mac mini is a game changer</text><text start="55.47" dur="1.41">because it&amp;#39;s all the benefits</text><text start="56.88" dur="1.44">of the new Apple Silicon stuff,</text><text start="58.32" dur="2.28">the second-generation,
five-nanometer process,</text><text start="60.6" dur="1.56">the blazing fast shared memory,</text><text start="62.16" dur="2.28">all the optimizations that come with it,</text><text start="64.44" dur="4.5">for a starting price of $599, US.</text><text start="68.94" dur="1.86">So I mean, it&amp;#39;s a pretty simple computer,</text><text start="70.8" dur="1.02">not even a small tower,</text><text start="71.82" dur="2.25">just an absolutely tiny computer in there.</text><text start="74.07" dur="1.47">It&amp;#39;s basically the laptop,</text><text start="75.54" dur="2.19">but without the screen and the keyboard,</text><text start="77.73" dur="1.524">only one color, silver,</text><text start="79.254" dur="2.346">and then a decent selection
of ports around the back,</text><text start="81.6" dur="2.94">along with a small exhaust
vent for active cooling,</text><text start="84.54" dur="1.23">and a headphone jack.</text><text start="85.77" dur="1.23">And so this thing packs</text><text start="87" dur="3.09">a surprisingly enormous
power for its size.</text><text start="90.09" dur="1.95">We&amp;#39;ve seen this Apple
Silicon transition play out</text><text start="92.04" dur="1.17">over the past two years.</text><text start="93.21" dur="3">And when the Mac mini
moved to Apple Silicon</text><text start="96.21" dur="1.234">from the Intel chips,</text><text start="97.444" dur="3.566">it took an absolutely hilarious
leap up in performance.</text><text start="101.01" dur="2.43">Some of the numbers on
paper are just ridiculous.</text><text start="103.44" dur="0.833">You have to forgive me</text><text start="104.273" dur="2.467">for using Apple&amp;#39;s stupid unlabeled charts,</text><text start="106.74" dur="2.19">but like, just to give you an idea,</text><text start="108.93" dur="2.34">this completely changed
the nature of the product.</text><text start="111.27" dur="2.25">So this M1 Mac mini is
already dramatically better</text><text start="113.52" dur="2.13">than the Intel one for 99% of people.</text><text start="115.65" dur="3.63">And now the M2 comes
along with more cores,</text><text start="119.28" dur="3.6">a more powerful CPU and
GPU, more max memory,</text><text start="122.88" dur="2.19">and a higher overall performance ceiling,</text><text start="125.07" dur="5">and the price goes down from $699 to $599.</text><text start="130.11" dur="1.68">Apple almost never lowers the price</text><text start="131.79" dur="1.2">of the entry level of anything,</text><text start="132.99" dur="1.29">but that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s happened here.</text><text start="134.28" dur="2.79">So we just got a computer
that&amp;#39;s more powerful,</text><text start="137.07" dur="4.26">and more capable, and more
efficient for less money.</text><text start="141.33" dur="2.453">And so then we also have
the M2 Pro Mac mini.</text><text start="143.783" dur="2.287">This is the one that I&amp;#39;ve
been testing and using.</text><text start="146.07" dur="1.11">And so before, we just had</text><text start="147.18" dur="3.389">the base Apple Silicon M1
Mac mini, now that&amp;#39;s the M2,</text><text start="150.569" dur="2.251">but we&amp;#39;ve also now got this Pro chip,</text><text start="152.82" dur="3.96">which raises the ceiling
for Mac mini performance,</text><text start="156.78" dur="1.56">still on the same tiny body.</text><text start="158.34" dur="2.16">Well, actually, I can&amp;#39;t say
the exact same tiny body,</text><text start="160.5" dur="1.41">because the M2 Pro version</text><text start="161.91" dur="2.76">also does gain two more Thunderbolt ports.</text><text start="164.67" dur="2.04">So now there&amp;#39;s four Thunderbolt
four ports on the back</text><text start="166.71" dur="1.53">along with everything else still here.</text><text start="168.24" dur="2.94">And that means you can now
do three external displays</text><text start="171.18" dur="1.2">instead of two,</text><text start="172.38" dur="2.34">and you can still option
up to 10 gigabit ethernet</text><text start="174.72" dur="2.4">if you&amp;#39;re blessed with that
type of internet connection,</text><text start="177.12" dur="2.07">or if you&amp;#39;re at an institution
that will take advantage</text><text start="179.19" dur="1.77">of the networking capability.</text><text start="180.96" dur="2.28">And yes, that is HDMI 2.1.</text><text start="183.24" dur="2.605">But the big deal here with
this new chip is the M2 Pro</text><text start="185.845" dur="2.015">is so much more performant</text><text start="187.86" dur="2.58">thanks to the updated
architecture, and the extra cores,</text><text start="190.44" dur="3.87">that it&amp;#39;s now benchmarking
actually over the M1 Pro</text><text start="194.31" dur="2.52">and the M1 Max in the CPU department</text><text start="196.83" dur="2.37">that was in the highest
end MacBook Pros before.</text><text start="199.2" dur="1.59">I had to double take
when I first read that,</text><text start="200.79" dur="2.7">because M1 Max has been so incredible,</text><text start="203.49" dur="0.833">but yet here we are,</text><text start="204.323" dur="2.647">even the incremental
improvements here are notable.</text><text start="206.97" dur="1.02">And on top of that,</text><text start="207.99" dur="2.25">the thermal advantage
potentially of a Mac mini</text><text start="210.24" dur="3.42">with active cooling in a taller
chassis over a MacBook Pro</text><text start="213.66" dur="1.8">can also mean in the long term, you know,</text><text start="215.46" dur="2.01">sustained CPU performance over time.</text><text start="217.47" dur="1.77">You may see even better results there.</text><text start="219.24" dur="2.97">So this thing&amp;#39;s performance is rock-solid.</text><text start="222.21" dur="2.032">And then, of course, as you
move up in chips from base</text><text start="224.242" dur="4.088">to Pro to Max, that&amp;#39;s actually
mostly a GPU improvement.</text><text start="228.33" dur="2.227">And so M2 Pro does great here, too,</text><text start="230.557" dur="3.053">but as you can see, the results
fall sort of more in line.</text><text start="233.61" dur="1.62">It&amp;#39;s improvement, of
course, over the last one,</text><text start="235.23" dur="2.91">but the Max chips are still the way to go</text><text start="238.14" dur="1.08">if your applications</text><text start="239.22" dur="2.474">specifically take advantage of GPU power.</text><text start="241.694" dur="2.296">But then everyday performance is just,</text><text start="243.99" dur="2.64">it&amp;#39;s gonna be the same,
which is to say, great.</text><text start="246.63" dur="3.06">But the sustained multi-core
performance ceiling</text><text start="249.69" dur="1.5">is just way higher.</text><text start="251.19" dur="2.16">You know, especially for
things like video editing,</text><text start="253.35" dur="1.14">or app development,</text><text start="254.49" dur="2.34">things that have basically
longer compiled times</text><text start="256.83" dur="0.833">or render times</text><text start="257.663" dur="2.467">that might be above what
you wanna do on the base M2,</text><text start="260.13" dur="1.29">that&amp;#39;s awesome on the M2 Pro.</text><text start="261.42" dur="2.43">This model starts at $1299.</text><text start="263.85" dur="0.833">Not cheap, of course,</text><text start="264.683" dur="3.007">but when you consider
the M2 Pro MacBook Pro</text><text start="267.69" dur="2.16">with the exact same system on a chip</text><text start="269.85" dur="3.079">starts at $1999 right now, pretty good.</text><text start="272.929" dur="2.111">That&amp;#39;s actually, that&amp;#39;s the real reason</text><text start="275.04" dur="2.25">I&amp;#39;m calling these Mac
minis a game changer,</text><text start="277.29" dur="4.05">or at least for being so good,
is performance per dollar.</text><text start="281.34" dur="1.5">You don&amp;#39;t usually expect
that out of a Mac,</text><text start="282.84" dur="2.58">but if I were to do like, one
of those dumb Apple charts</text><text start="285.42" dur="2.4">of like, here&amp;#39;s the laptops
performance per dollar,</text><text start="287.82" dur="1.23">and then here&amp;#39;s the Mac mini&amp;#39;s,</text><text start="289.05" dur="1.44">which is the same performance,</text><text start="290.49" dur="2.19">but for less money, it&amp;#39;s
better, the line&amp;#39;s higher.</text><text start="292.68" dur="2.43">You know, for so long Apple&amp;#39;s
prioritized these laptops,</text><text start="295.11" dur="1.5">which makes perfect sense, by the way.</text><text start="296.61" dur="1.869">They&amp;#39;ve been great,
lots of people buy them.</text><text start="298.479" dur="2.061">But some people get the laptop,</text><text start="300.54" dur="1.98">and then just keep it
in one room all the time</text><text start="302.52" dur="2.76">because desktop options
aren&amp;#39;t as appealing.</text><text start="305.28" dur="2.67">And if we&amp;#39;re being
honest, the iMac is cool,</text><text start="307.95" dur="1.35">but it&amp;#39;s not for everyone.</text><text start="309.3" dur="0.9">Like even right now,</text><text start="310.2" dur="2.88">it kind of feels like Apple
low-key forgot about the iMac.</text><text start="313.08" dur="0.87">It&amp;#39;s just been sitting</text><text start="313.95" dur="2.79">with the unupgraded M1 chip
for a little while now,</text><text start="316.74" dur="2.7">even when M2 is out, but
then they dropped Mac Studio.</text><text start="319.44" dur="1.47">And Mac Studio is excellent</text><text start="320.91" dur="1.89">in the highest end configurations,</text><text start="322.8" dur="2.91">and I can&amp;#39;t wait for the M2 Ultra here.</text><text start="325.71" dur="2.76">But yeah, the Mac mini now slots in</text><text start="328.47" dur="1.95">really nicely underneath all of that.</text><text start="330.42" dur="2.07">And, of course, with the
modularity of a desktop</text><text start="332.49" dur="1.95">that doesn&amp;#39;t come with a monitor built in,</text><text start="334.44" dur="1.654">now you pick whatever display you want</text><text start="336.094" dur="2.336">with the $700 you save.</text><text start="338.43" dur="1.05">It&amp;#39;s funny, in recent reviews,</text><text start="339.48" dur="1.83">I&amp;#39;ve been trying to give
sustainability notes</text><text start="341.31" dur="1.05">where it&amp;#39;s relevant.</text><text start="342.36" dur="2.46">And so there are some neat
ones with this machine</text><text start="344.82" dur="3.24">like recycled aluminum, the
the packaging on the outside,</text><text start="348.06" dur="2.61">the recycled plastics on
the inside of the Mac,</text><text start="350.67" dur="3.63">all that&amp;#39;s cool, but all of
that sort of is outweighed</text><text start="354.3" dur="3.33">by the ability to continue
using your same display,</text><text start="357.63" dur="3.27">and swap out displays however
you want, unlike the iMac.</text><text start="360.9" dur="1.8">Call me crazy, but I think
there&amp;#39;s a lot of people</text><text start="362.7" dur="1.95">who probably don&amp;#39;t wanna be stuck</text><text start="364.65" dur="2.49">with a non-upgradable display and webcam</text><text start="367.14" dur="1.14">and white bezels forever.</text><text start="368.28" dur="2.13">Plus, if you already
have a display you like,</text><text start="370.41" dur="1.62">yeah, you can just continue using that.</text><text start="372.03" dur="2.55">I haven&amp;#39;t done a video on the Mac mini</text><text start="374.58" dur="3.69">since the &amp;quot;Fastest Mac
Mini in the World&amp;quot; project</text><text start="378.27" dur="2.43">that I did back in college.</text><text start="380.7" dur="1.89">Shout out to those of you
who subscribed back then.</text><text start="382.59" dur="0.833">But I basically,</text><text start="383.423" dur="2.827">I took the highest-end
available Mac mini in 2012,</text><text start="386.25" dur="3.09">and maxed it out by
upgrading to the fastest RAM,</text><text start="389.34" dur="2.43">the fastest SSD it would support,</text><text start="391.77" dur="3.48">in an effort to make it like,
the most capable tiny machine</text><text start="395.25" dur="2.61">for a college dorm room
where space is at a premium.</text><text start="397.86" dur="1.8">Because, clearly, my
priorities at the time</text><text start="399.66" dur="2.04">were video editing over homework.</text><text start="401.7" dur="3.06">Now, this M2 Pro Mac mini</text><text start="404.76" dur="3.3">has all the power that I
would&amp;#39;ve killed for back then</text><text start="408.06" dur="2.468">as a fledgling creator
with not a lot of space,</text><text start="410.528" dur="2.002">and it costs less.</text><text start="412.53" dur="0.833">It costs less.</text><text start="413.363" dur="0.833">I had to look back.</text><text start="414.196" dur="3.351">I had spent in total with
the Mac and all the upgrades,</text><text start="417.547" dur="4.852">$1,759 for the fastest
Mac mini in the world.</text><text start="422.399" dur="2.461">This one blows it out the
water as far as performance</text><text start="424.86" dur="0.833">and capability.</text><text start="425.693" dur="0.833">Of course, the difference here</text><text start="426.526" dur="2.144">is no part of this
tightly-integrated machine</text><text start="428.67" dur="0.833">is upgradable at all.</text><text start="429.503" dur="2.209">So now you gotta think about
spending a little bit more</text><text start="431.712" dur="2.868">to account for having the
machine for a long time</text><text start="434.58" dur="1.47">and not upgrading things.</text><text start="436.05" dur="2.37">Maybe a little more RAM,
maybe a little more storage.</text><text start="438.42" dur="1.53">Depends on what you&amp;#39;re doing with it.</text><text start="439.95" dur="2.64">But yeah, this would have
blown out the water...</text><text start="442.59" dur="1.5">This can handle basically any footage</text><text start="444.09" dur="2.73">that I could possibly throw at
it that I could shoot myself.</text><text start="446.82" dur="0.833">Also, by the way,</text><text start="447.653" dur="1.657">if you actually do happen to
be looking at one of these</text><text start="449.31" dur="2.19">and you are in college
like I was back then,</text><text start="451.5" dur="1.56">don&amp;#39;t forget about the student discount.</text><text start="453.06" dur="1.62">That&amp;#39;s typically a hundred bucks off.</text><text start="454.68" dur="1.65">And I think with these
machines it&amp;#39;s a hundred bucks.</text><text start="456.33" dur="1.86">So now that brings this down a hundred.</text><text start="458.19" dur="4.5">That also brings the base M2
down to $499, which is great.</text><text start="462.69" dur="2.04">So in conclusion, if you&amp;#39;re
trying to think of...</text><text start="464.73" dur="2.22">If you&amp;#39;re trying to pick
one Mac to buy right now,</text><text start="466.95" dur="1.32">think of it this way.</text><text start="468.27" dur="3.39">If you already have an Apple Silicon Mac,</text><text start="471.66" dur="2.82">like an M1 generation Mac, you&amp;#39;re good.</text><text start="474.48" dur="1.59">You don&amp;#39;t have to buy
a new Mac every year.</text><text start="476.07" dur="2.46">Those machines were a great
update over the Intel ones.</text><text start="478.53" dur="0.833">You&amp;#39;re set.</text><text start="479.363" dur="0.833">Now, if you have an older machine,</text><text start="480.196" dur="1.244">and you&amp;#39;re actually looking to upgrade,</text><text start="481.44" dur="2.73">I would actually default to the Mac mini,</text><text start="484.17" dur="3.24">and just start with the
base M2 $599 Mac mini.</text><text start="487.41" dur="2.55">And I would not buy the iMac right now,</text><text start="489.96" dur="2.67">because if you look at
the specs specifically,</text><text start="492.63" dur="1.17">it&amp;#39;s still M1,</text><text start="493.8" dur="4.23">and it&amp;#39;s $1299 for a
non-removable 24-inch display.</text><text start="498.03" dur="1.8">I would just get the Mac mini instead,</text><text start="499.83" dur="1.83">and get whatever $600 screen you want.</text><text start="501.66" dur="1.2">You can swap that out however.</text><text start="502.86" dur="2.16">So I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend iMac right now.</text><text start="505.02" dur="1.11">And then if you know</text><text start="506.13" dur="2.369">that you specifically wanna
be computing on the go,</text><text start="508.499" dur="2.131">that&amp;#39;s when you move over, okay, okay,</text><text start="510.63" dur="1.68">the laptops are really good.</text><text start="512.31" dur="2.91">You can get an M2-generation MacBook Pro,</text><text start="515.22" dur="0.96">and those are excellent.</text><text start="516.18" dur="0.833">I just reviewed them.</text><text start="517.013" dur="0.907">If you wanna check it out,</text><text start="517.92" dur="2.341">link&amp;#39;s below the like
button, that video&amp;#39;s up,</text><text start="520.261" dur="1.679">and that&amp;#39;s how I think about the lineup.</text><text start="521.94" dur="0.833">But honestly,</text><text start="522.773" dur="2.497">if you can find an M1-generation
MacBook Pro right now</text><text start="525.27" dur="2.07">on a discount, that&amp;#39;s really good, too.</text><text start="527.34" dur="1.98">And then within each lineup,
of course, I keep saying this,</text><text start="529.32" dur="4.44">but the big difference
between M2, M2 Pro, M2 Max,</text><text start="533.76" dur="3.3">and eventually M2 Ultra when
when it comes out, is GPU.</text><text start="537.06" dur="1.08">So it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a shock</text><text start="538.14" dur="2.94">that they&amp;#39;re all sort of
similar in CPU performance.</text><text start="541.08" dur="1.83">But if the applications that you use,</text><text start="542.91" dur="3.24">and you know your workflow will
take advantage of GPU power,</text><text start="546.15" dur="1.595">then that&amp;#39;s when you bump that up.</text><text start="547.745" dur="2.695">Okay, yeah, that&amp;#39;s pretty much it.</text><text start="550.44" dur="1.41">Maybe a little bit shocking, but yeah,</text><text start="551.85" dur="4.32">price for performance, Mac
mini, kind of a huge winner.</text><text start="556.17" dur="3.177">Mac mini might make me
miss removable memory,</text><text start="559.347" dur="4.596">but it makes most massive
media machines feel pretty mid.</text><text start="565.08" dur="1.35">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="566.43" dur="0.833">Catch you guys the next one.</text><text start="567.263" dur="1.276">Peace.</text><text start="568.539" dur="2.417">(soft music)</text></transcript>
