Yeah.</text><text start="7.23" dur="1.89">Just, it&amp;#39;s a good one though. I promise.</text><text start="9.12" dur="1.53">- Yeah, mhm. I&amp;#39;m sure.</text><text start="10.65" dur="0.833">- No. Okay.</text><text start="11.483" dur="2.227">So I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about</text><text start="13.71" dur="4.86">what a second-generation
Vision Pro might look like.</text><text start="18.57" dur="3.09">- But didn&amp;#39;t this literally just came out?</text><text start="21.66" dur="2.1">- No, I know, but okay, so obviously,</text><text start="23.76" dur="1.92">there are lots of other VR headsets,</text><text start="25.68" dur="1.874">but there are lots of things</text><text start="27.554" dur="1.606">that got way more interesting</text><text start="29.16" dur="1.5">about this one joining the market,</text><text start="30.66" dur="2.471">and if you compare this to those,</text><text start="33.131" dur="2.029">this is missing stuff.</text><text start="35.16" dur="3.18">- Right, but that is also
the most expensive ones.</text><text start="38.34" dur="0.95">- Yeah, yeah, yeah.</text><text start="40.2" dur="2.28">There are things that the Quest 3 does</text><text start="42.48" dur="3.72">that if the Vision Pro
did it, it would feel like</text><text start="46.2" dur="2.76">it&amp;#39;s a revolutionary change to this thing.</text><text start="48.96" dur="1.74">It&amp;#39;s a good video, I swear.</text><text start="50.7" dur="1.35">- All right. I&amp;#39;ll allow it.</text><text start="53.28" dur="2.64">- This doesn&amp;#39;t work though. You can&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="55.92" dur="0.84">- Okay.

(logo whooshes)</text><text start="60.21" dur="1.95">So I don&amp;#39;t think the
Vision Pro is gonna be</text><text start="62.16" dur="3.24">an every single year product
update, like the iPhone.</text><text start="65.4" dur="0.93">I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be one of those</text><text start="66.33" dur="1.41">that&amp;#39;s like every couple of years.</text><text start="67.74" dur="1.98">You stack up enough tech
updates every once in a while</text><text start="69.72" dur="2.19">and it&amp;#39;s worthy of a new generation</text><text start="71.91" dur="1.8">and then it&amp;#39;s a bigger
deal when it comes out,</text><text start="73.71" dur="0.833">and by the way,</text><text start="74.543" dur="1.387">that&amp;#39;s how a lot of other
VR headsets have been.</text><text start="75.93" dur="3.87">The Quest 3 came out like
three years after the Quest 2,</text><text start="79.8" dur="4.23">and the PS VR 2 came out like
six years after the first one.</text><text start="84.03" dur="2.67">So, in a sense, this is
already very early thoughts,</text><text start="86.7" dur="1.47">but it&amp;#39;s been out for a little bit</text><text start="88.17" dur="1.26">and we&amp;#39;re really starting
to get a sense of</text><text start="89.43" dur="1.38">where people are using it</text><text start="90.81" dur="2.28">and how people are getting
the most value out of it,</text><text start="93.09" dur="2.55">and let me tell you, a lot
of people are definitely</text><text start="95.64" dur="1.68">still not convinced</text><text start="97.32" dur="2.31">on the whole VR or
Vision Pro thing at all.</text><text start="99.63" dur="2.13">Like, it&amp;#39;s an interesting
product for sure,</text><text start="101.76" dur="2.208">but it just doesn&amp;#39;t do much,</text><text start="103.968" dur="2.772">and I started having
those thoughts immediately</text><text start="106.74" dur="1.38">as soon as I started testing this thing,</text><text start="108.12" dur="3.27">just all sorts of missing stuff
that I would like it to do.</text><text start="111.39" dur="2.73">So this is all those things in one place.</text><text start="114.12" dur="2.7">So probably the biggest
thing that you&amp;#39;ve noticed</text><text start="116.82" dur="2.28">if you&amp;#39;ve been familiar
with the VR headset world</text><text start="119.1" dur="2.07">or used any other VR headset before</text><text start="121.17" dur="4.65">is the Vision Pro is
missing shared experiences.</text><text start="125.82" dur="4.218">Like, you are always so
alone in this headset.</text><text start="130.038" dur="1.692">Like, meaning there are lots of other</text><text start="131.73" dur="2.28">great, super immersive experiences,</text><text start="134.01" dur="3.09">and you can be productive
and you can watch a movie,</text><text start="137.1" dur="2.46">but no matter what&amp;#39;s
happening, you&amp;#39;re always alone.</text><text start="139.56" dur="1.53">Even if you have pass through on,</text><text start="141.09" dur="2.4">nobody else can see what you see,</text><text start="143.49" dur="2.22">and so it&amp;#39;s basically impossible to share</text><text start="145.71" dur="1.08">what you&amp;#39;re experiencing</text><text start="146.79" dur="2.43">without, you know, mirroring
everything on an iPad</text><text start="149.22" dur="0.84">or something like that.</text><text start="150.06" dur="1.71">Now, FaceTime is close.</text><text start="151.77" dur="2.25">It&amp;#39;s one thing, but I&amp;#39;m talking about</text><text start="154.02" dur="4.44">sharing one virtual space
with more than one person</text><text start="158.46" dur="2.13">or seeing the same virtual environment</text><text start="160.59" dur="2.52">at the same time with multiple people</text><text start="163.11" dur="3.09">or seeing the same virtual object</text><text start="166.2" dur="3">from two different
perspectives at the same time.</text><text start="169.2" dur="1.535">You ever play &amp;quot;Rec Room&amp;quot;?</text><text start="170.735" dur="3.745">It&amp;#39;s one of the oldest but most
fun games on the Meta Quest.</text><text start="174.48" dur="1.14">It&amp;#39;s just so simple.</text><text start="175.62" dur="1.56">You&amp;#39;re just out there having fun,</text><text start="177.18" dur="2.13">but it&amp;#39;s a bunch of people running around</text><text start="179.31" dur="2.82">a room or an environment
to different game areas</text><text start="182.13" dur="1.47">where they can jump into an experience</text><text start="183.6" dur="1.8">and play a game together.</text><text start="185.4" dur="1.95">So, in that digital space,</text><text start="187.35" dur="3.72">you look around and see other people,</text><text start="191.07" dur="2.78">and I use people with air
quotes, but you see them,</text><text start="193.85" dur="3.58">they see you, and you can
see the same environment</text><text start="197.43" dur="1.86">from different angles at the same time</text><text start="199.29" dur="1.41">and explore it together.</text><text start="200.7" dur="1.59">It doesn&amp;#39;t even have to be super realistic</text><text start="202.29" dur="1.29">or high resolution</text><text start="203.58" dur="2.01">or convince you that it&amp;#39;s another reality,</text><text start="205.59" dur="2.64">but it&amp;#39;s just way more social</text><text start="208.23" dur="4.08">and interactive and fun that
way, but on Apple Vision Pro,</text><text start="212.31" dur="3.15">aside from FaceTime really,
all of the other experiences,</text><text start="215.46" dur="2.501">it&amp;#39;s just you in there solo.</text><text start="217.961" dur="1.969">Like, there&amp;#39;s nobody else in there.</text><text start="219.93" dur="1.23">So, no matter what you&amp;#39;re doing,</text><text start="221.16" dur="1.53">no matter how immersive the movie is</text><text start="222.69" dur="2.079">or no matter how good
the game is around you,</text><text start="224.769" dur="2.001">you&amp;#39;re in there by yourself</text><text start="226.77" dur="2.25">and nobody else can
see what you&amp;#39;re seeing.</text><text start="229.02" dur="2.01">Like, just, here&amp;#39;s a basic example.</text><text start="231.03" dur="1.83">How sick would it be if you</text><text start="232.86" dur="2.28">and the person next to you on a plane</text><text start="235.14" dur="3.81">could sync up your experiences
and both watch the same movie</text><text start="238.95" dur="2.73">in a virtual theater at the same time?</text><text start="241.68" dur="0.93">Simple as that,</text><text start="242.61" dur="2.608">or maybe if you were manipulating
a 3D object in space,</text><text start="245.218" dur="2.762">wouldn&amp;#39;t it make a ton of sense</text><text start="247.98" dur="3.221">for someone else to be able
to share that object with you</text><text start="251.201" dur="3.259">so that they can see how
you&amp;#39;re manipulating it?</text><text start="254.46" dur="1.71">Like, it feels like it
just makes too much sense.</text><text start="256.17" dur="1.65">I told you guys about that Sky Guide app,</text><text start="257.82" dur="1.11">which has like, you know,</text><text start="258.93" dur="2.25">you look up and there&amp;#39;s all the
stars and the constellations</text><text start="261.18" dur="1.65">and it shows you where
they&amp;#39;re all supposed to be.</text><text start="262.83" dur="1.11">It is pretty awesome.</text><text start="263.94" dur="2.43">Funny enough, there&amp;#39;s
a laser pointer feature</text><text start="266.37" dur="2.466">that lets you point a
laser pointer at the sky</text><text start="268.836" dur="3.444">and circle around and point
at things and draw things,</text><text start="272.28" dur="2.25">but, still, nobody can see</text><text start="274.53" dur="1.86">what you&amp;#39;re pointing at with the laser,</text><text start="276.39" dur="1.77">even if they have a Vision Pro.</text><text start="278.16" dur="3.532">So there are two basic
types of shared experiences</text><text start="281.692" dur="3.698">that it would just be great
for Apple to add to this thing.</text><text start="285.39" dur="3.938">The first one is two different
people with Vision Pros</text><text start="289.328" dur="3.308">are in the same room with pass through on</text><text start="292.636" dur="3.284">and one of them drops a
virtual object into that room</text><text start="295.92" dur="3.15">and the other can see it at the same time.</text><text start="299.07" dur="2.52">Manipulate the object.
They can see it as well.</text><text start="301.59" dur="0.9">Great.</text><text start="302.49" dur="3.75">The other is two different
people with Vision Pros</text><text start="306.24" dur="1.5">in different places,</text><text start="307.74" dur="2.07">halfway across the world, doesn&amp;#39;t matter.</text><text start="309.81" dur="3.96">They both turn on or join
the same virtual environment</text><text start="313.77" dur="2.862">and can see it at the same time.</text><text start="316.632" dur="4.008">As of right now, I believe
the first one is harder</text><text start="320.64" dur="2.1">because the way these headsets
work with the pass through</text><text start="322.74" dur="1.59">is, basically, in real time,</text><text start="324.33" dur="2.55">they are mapping the
volume of space around you</text><text start="326.88" dur="2.1">with the sensors on the front of it,</text><text start="328.98" dur="2.19">the surfaces, the walls, the floor,</text><text start="331.17" dur="1.77">the objects around you and everything.</text><text start="332.94" dur="2.52">That&amp;#39;s how Vision OS is
able to lock your apps</text><text start="335.46" dur="1.5">floating in 3D space</text><text start="336.96" dur="2.49">and how it&amp;#39;s casting shadows
onto different surfaces</text><text start="339.45" dur="1.59">in your room with decent accuracy,</text><text start="341.04" dur="2.46">but there&amp;#39;s no guarantee that,</text><text start="343.5" dur="1.29">if you&amp;#39;re in a room with someone else</text><text start="344.79" dur="1.26">who also has a headset on,</text><text start="346.05" dur="2.19">that both your headsets
are mapping the room</text><text start="348.24" dur="1.65">in the exact same way.</text><text start="349.89" dur="2.04">Like, maybe I place an object into space,</text><text start="351.93" dur="3.06">but your headset doesn&amp;#39;t see
space there so it&amp;#39;s confused,</text><text start="354.99" dur="2.362">or it doesn&amp;#39;t map my hands</text><text start="357.352" dur="2.888">or what I&amp;#39;m manipulating
in the exact same way.</text><text start="360.24" dur="2.88">It&amp;#39;s just not exactly
guaranteed to be the same,</text><text start="363.12" dur="1.17">but the other kind,</text><text start="364.29" dur="2.73">just sharing a virtual
environment someone builds</text><text start="367.02" dur="4.56">with anyone anywhere in the
world seems like a no-brainer.</text><text start="371.58" dur="3.03">Like, being able to watch a
movie in a virtual movie theater</text><text start="374.61" dur="1.65">with someone else who also gets</text><text start="376.26" dur="1.71">a seat in that movie theater,</text><text start="377.97" dur="3.42">playing an obvious multiplayer
game in the same environment.</text><text start="381.39" dur="3.21">Like, this stuff is pretty basic with VR.</text><text start="384.6" dur="2.79">I love multiplayer table
tennis in the Quest.</text><text start="387.39" dur="2.19">It&amp;#39;s one of my favorite
shared VR experiences.</text><text start="389.58" dur="2.61">You can play against people
anywhere else in the world.</text><text start="392.19" dur="1.62">There&amp;#39;s all kinds of
other multiplayer games</text><text start="393.81" dur="1.158">like this in VR.</text><text start="394.968" dur="3.342">That is a huge part of
the VR gaming experience,</text><text start="398.31" dur="2.13">and I just wonder why this
doesn&amp;#39;t have that yet.</text><text start="400.44" dur="2.22">It seems like a huge, huge thing,</text><text start="402.66" dur="1.14">especially, and I know, you know,</text><text start="403.8" dur="1.86">Apple has environments
that they&amp;#39;ve built in</text><text start="405.66" dur="1.8">and they&amp;#39;re massive in high resolution,</text><text start="407.46" dur="1.847">but you can only move a little bit</text><text start="409.307" dur="3.043">before you&amp;#39;re out of the
play zone, if you will.</text><text start="412.35" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s fascinating.</text><text start="413.183" dur="1.087">I wonder if that&amp;#39;s something to do with</text><text start="414.27" dur="2.31">the way Apple thinks
about these environments.</text><text start="416.58" dur="1.32">Nevertheless, what I know is</text><text start="417.9" dur="2.22">that&amp;#39;s the number one missing
feature on the Vision Pro</text><text start="420.12" dur="1.2">that I&amp;#39;d love to see in a second gen.</text><text start="421.32" dur="2.61">Now, the other big one
that stands out to me is,</text><text start="423.93" dur="2.79">if I wanna use Vision
Pro a lot in, let&amp;#39;s say,</text><text start="426.72" dur="5">multiple, just two different
locations, home and work,</text><text start="432.29" dur="4.51">I wish that it had a memory
of all the windows and apps</text><text start="436.8" dur="2.46">that I leave open in each place.</text><text start="439.26" dur="1.83">See, Vision Pro is actually already</text><text start="441.09" dur="2.28">amazing at this in one space.</text><text start="443.37" dur="1.5">It&amp;#39;s seriously incredible.</text><text start="444.87" dur="3.15">Windows stay locked to
where you leave them</text><text start="448.02" dur="2.4">as it live maps its way around your space.</text><text start="450.42" dur="1.8">So you can pin something to a wall</text><text start="452.22" dur="2.454">and then walk around and pin
something to another wall</text><text start="454.674" dur="2.466">or just in the middle of the room.</text><text start="457.14" dur="2.88">Leave the room, come
back, they&amp;#39;re still there.</text><text start="460.02" dur="1.47">I even tried, ready for this?</text><text start="461.49" dur="1.86">I pinned a window right here</text><text start="463.35" dur="2.49">between these two cars in the parking lot.</text><text start="465.84" dur="1.62">Then I turned and walked away,</text><text start="467.46" dur="3.095">just left it behind me in the
parking lot, walked inside,</text><text start="470.555" dur="2.875">walked all the way down this long hallway,</text><text start="473.43" dur="3.85">totally out of sight, around
another corner into the studio,</text><text start="477.28" dur="1.254">and sure enough,</text><text start="478.534" dur="3.866">that window is still right
there where I left it</text><text start="482.4" dur="1.74">between those spaces in the parking lot.</text><text start="484.14" dur="2.1">The only thing holding it
back from being nearly perfect</text><text start="486.24" dur="0.87">is occlusion.</text><text start="487.11" dur="1.5">Basically, the only thing</text><text start="488.61" dur="3">that ever gets between the window and you</text><text start="491.61" dur="3.21">is your own arms and hands,
which is usually totally fine,</text><text start="494.82" dur="1.92">but if you have something
like around a corner,</text><text start="496.74" dur="3.09">it doesn&amp;#39;t put the wall in
between you and the window,</text><text start="499.83" dur="0.87">which is where it should be.</text><text start="500.7" dur="1.41">So, sometimes it gets a little wonky,</text><text start="502.11" dur="2.73">but overall 9 out of
10, already really cool,</text><text start="504.84" dur="1.89">but the second it gets dinged is</text><text start="506.73" dur="2.19">when you wanna do this
in more than one space.</text><text start="508.92" dur="3.57">So let&amp;#39;s say, at home, I&amp;#39;ve set
up all these suite monitors.</text><text start="512.49" dur="2.31">I&amp;#39;ve got a virtual TV
in one room and a game</text><text start="514.8" dur="3.09">and some windows all over
the walls or whatever.</text><text start="517.89" dur="1.02">Cool.</text><text start="518.91" dur="2.37">I pack it up, I drive here to the studio,</text><text start="521.28" dur="4.644">and I put it on, and the second
I start opening apps here,</text><text start="525.924" dur="3.135">they have to disappear from home.</text><text start="529.059" dur="2.391">They basically disappear
from any other space</text><text start="531.45" dur="1.53">and open in your new space.</text><text start="532.98" dur="3.42">So there is no memory of
different older spaces,</text><text start="536.4" dur="3.12">so when I go back home, my
windows are all gonna be gone,</text><text start="539.52" dur="2.88">and I&amp;#39;ll have to set them
each individually up again.</text><text start="542.4" dur="2.91">Not a huge deal, but if it had a memory,</text><text start="545.31" dur="1.92">wouldn&amp;#39;t that just make sense?</text><text start="547.23" dur="1.92">I wonder if you could set
up like little beacons.</text><text start="549.15" dur="1.32">Like, all it really probably needs is</text><text start="550.47" dur="1.95">like a QR code or some visual identifier,</text><text start="552.42" dur="2.475">but basically, you get home,
you put the headset on,</text><text start="554.895" dur="2.625">it sees the beacon, and then
it goes, &amp;quot;Oh, I&amp;#39;m at home,&amp;quot;</text><text start="557.52" dur="1.83">and then it puts your
windows all the way up</text><text start="559.35" dur="2.49">where it already knows you
usually have them for work,</text><text start="561.84" dur="1.89">and so you basically just
kick back on the couch,</text><text start="563.73" dur="2.46">put the headset on, and
you don&amp;#39;t have to re-set up</text><text start="566.19" dur="1.95">each window in all the
same places you want it</text><text start="568.14" dur="0.833">every single time.</text><text start="568.973" dur="2.077">It just remembers that.
That would be sick.</text><text start="571.05" dur="1.17">Those two features alone</text><text start="572.22" dur="1.86">I think would make a dramatic update</text><text start="574.08" dur="3.96">to how often I realistically
would use Vision Pro.</text><text start="578.04" dur="1.53">Just, I don&amp;#39;t know if that requires</text><text start="579.57" dur="1.38">some Vision OS software update</text><text start="580.95" dur="2.31">or if you need more
compute to do things like</text><text start="583.26" dur="3.06">more memory of locations
or shared computing spaces,</text><text start="586.32" dur="2.593">but that&amp;#39;s the giant things</text><text start="588.913" dur="2.987">that I think are missing from
it that would be awesome.</text><text start="591.9" dur="2.19">Then the rest of the
stuff, on my list anyway,</text><text start="594.09" dur="1.95">is maybe a little more icing on the cake.</text><text start="596.04" dur="0.833">Like, here&amp;#39;s another one.</text><text start="596.873" dur="3.564">I think probably 99.99% of people</text><text start="600.437" dur="3.179">who buy a Vision Pro have an iPhone.</text><text start="603.616" dur="1.034">I think that&amp;#39;s pretty safe.</text><text start="604.65" dur="0.833">It might be a hundred,</text><text start="605.483" dur="1.857">but I think that&amp;#39;s a
reasonable assumption,</text><text start="607.34" dur="1.51">and I found it interesting.</text><text start="608.85" dur="2.34">I think a lot of people assume that</text><text start="611.19" dur="2.07">it&amp;#39;ll just connect to the iPhone</text><text start="613.26" dur="1.14">and they think that they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text><text start="614.4" dur="1.71">see their phone notifications</text><text start="616.11" dur="2.7">straight away on the
Vision Pro, but it&amp;#39;s not.</text><text start="618.81" dur="3.39">It&amp;#39;s a separate device
like a Mac or an iPad.</text><text start="622.2" dur="2.272">So, yeah, it&amp;#39;ll show you iMessage stuff</text><text start="624.472" dur="3.248">&amp;#39;cause that&amp;#39;s everywhere,
but it is a separate device.</text><text start="627.72" dur="1.32">But, you know, the obvious difference is,</text><text start="629.04" dur="3.677">unlike a Mac or an iPad,
when you put on a headset,</text><text start="632.717" dur="2.794">well, now, you&amp;#39;re wearing a headset,</text><text start="635.511" dur="4.208">so if I were to get a
phone call on my iPhone,</text><text start="639.719" dur="1.867">I couldn&amp;#39;t necessarily</text><text start="641.586" dur="1.914">even see that I&amp;#39;m getting a phone call.</text><text start="643.5" dur="2.31">There is no notification
for it in the Vision Pro,</text><text start="645.81" dur="1.89">and I&amp;#39;m gonna have to take the headset off</text><text start="647.7" dur="2.55">to even see it coming and
accept that phone call.</text><text start="650.25" dur="2.01">So it would be nice to have an option</text><text start="652.26" dur="2.73">where these two things talk
to each other a little better.</text><text start="654.99" dur="1.017">Just maybe a little hub</text><text start="656.007" dur="2.763">for just my smartphone&amp;#39;s notifications</text><text start="658.77" dur="2.2">over to the side if I wanna check them.</text><text start="660.97" dur="3.26">I think it makes sense. They
probably won&amp;#39;t do that though.</text><text start="664.23" dur="1.5">But here&amp;#39;s a number for you.</text><text start="665.73" dur="4.17">3,386.</text><text start="669.9" dur="5">That is the pixel density of
the Vision Pro&amp;#39;s displays.</text><text start="675.96" dur="1.44">It&amp;#39;s kind of a ridiculous number.</text><text start="677.4" dur="2.7">Over 3,000 pixels per inch each.</text><text start="680.1" dur="1.02">So there&amp;#39;s been some tear-downs.</text><text start="681.12" dur="1.38">I&amp;#39;ll link some below the like buttons.</text><text start="682.5" dur="3.3">You can see them up close.
They&amp;#39;re incredibly sharp.</text><text start="685.8" dur="3.388">So, that and the high refresh
rate and minimal distortion</text><text start="689.188" dur="2.126">all contribute to a pass-through</text><text start="691.314" dur="2.826">and just everything feeling so real,</text><text start="694.14" dur="4.139">but the number I&amp;#39;d actually
like to improve is 92.</text><text start="698.279" dur="3.031">So the Vision Pros displays show</text><text start="701.31" dur="3.99">92% of the DCI-P3 color gamut.</text><text start="705.3" dur="0.833">Pretty good coverage.</text><text start="706.133" dur="2.077">Like, for a display, that&amp;#39;s
honestly pretty good.</text><text start="708.21" dur="2.52">The reference grade display that is, like,</text><text start="710.73" dur="1.62">the Pro Display XCR, for example,</text><text start="712.35" dur="2.58">that&amp;#39;ll show you you 99% of DCI-P3.</text><text start="714.93" dur="2.07">So, again, it&amp;#39;s, for a
display, a pretty great number,</text><text start="717" dur="2.47">but the thing about a VR headset is</text><text start="720.591" dur="1.719">it&amp;#39;s replacing your eyes.</text><text start="722.31" dur="3.45">Like, the pass through is
pretty good for what it is,</text><text start="725.76" dur="1.95">but without getting too complicated,</text><text start="727.71" dur="5">100% coverage of DCI-P3
is about 50% coverage</text><text start="733.747" dur="3.525">of all of the colors that
the human eye can see.</text><text start="737.272" dur="3.728">So this headset looks
great and it&amp;#39;s very sharp,</text><text start="741" dur="1.14">but it&amp;#39;s only showing me</text><text start="742.14" dur="3.42">a little less than half
of the colors of reality.</text><text start="745.56" dur="2.13">So I wonder how much
they can improve that,</text><text start="747.69" dur="2.46">because the human eye is obviously insane.</text><text start="750.15" dur="3.557">It has crazy dynamic range
and foveated rendering</text><text start="753.707" dur="1.843">and great sharpness
and all that fun stuff,</text><text start="755.55" dur="2.01">but, you know, Apple&amp;#39;s been really good</text><text start="757.56" dur="1.56">at a lot of displays for a long time</text><text start="759.12" dur="2.1">and these are some incredible displays.</text><text start="761.22" dur="4.08">So, field of view, wider
please, but also, yeah,</text><text start="765.3" dur="2.58">just generally more color
would be interesting.</text><text start="767.88" dur="1.74">There&amp;#39;s lots of other little
things that are obvious,</text><text start="769.62" dur="3.194">like weight reduction please, of course.</text><text start="772.814" dur="2.566">Higher quality screen recording</text><text start="775.38" dur="1.53">is a niche little request of mine,</text><text start="776.91" dur="1.32">but I think would help a lot</text><text start="778.23" dur="2.94">for people trying to make
videos with these things.</text><text start="781.17" dur="4.769">Also, even more specific,
keyboard pass-through</text><text start="785.939" dur="2.371">while in an environment.</text><text start="788.31" dur="1.8">So you&amp;#39;re in an
environment, you&amp;#39;re typing,</text><text start="790.11" dur="1.59">you&amp;#39;ve got your virtual Mac display,</text><text start="791.7" dur="3.81">and if it can see and recognize
my hands after a scan,</text><text start="795.51" dur="2.61">I think it would be nice
if you could also build in</text><text start="798.12" dur="2.16">a feature to scan your keyboard</text><text start="800.28" dur="2.64">or recognize the keyboard of your MacBook,</text><text start="802.92" dur="2.43">just &amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s gonna
look the same every time,</text><text start="805.35" dur="1.39">kind of like my hands.</text><text start="806.74" dur="2.15">All that being said, I&amp;#39;m
sure there are more things</text><text start="808.89" dur="2.1">that people, you know, are
thinking about on their lists,</text><text start="810.99" dur="2.04">but let me know what you think about</text><text start="813.03" dur="2.97">Apple Vision Pro gen two.</text><text start="816" dur="3">Maybe leave your wishlist
in the comments below.</text><text start="819" dur="1.5">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="820.5" dur="2.456">Catch you guys on the next one. Peace.</text><text start="822.956" dur="2.583">(lively music)</text></transcript>
