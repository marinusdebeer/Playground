cameras, a hidden stylus.</text><text start="24.835" dur="1.513">You get the plan.</text><text start="26.348" dur="3.622">(upbeat techno music continues)</text><text start="29.97" dur="1.29">Hey, what&amp;#39;s up, MKBHD here,</text><text start="31.26" dur="4.62">and this is the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.</text><text start="35.88" dur="2.73">So, when this first came
out, when it got revealed,</text><text start="38.61" dur="1.74">it was the easiest thing to do</text><text start="40.35" dur="2.61">to just write it off as
an incremental upgrade,</text><text start="42.96" dur="1.83">because I mean, look at it.</text><text start="44.79" dur="2.61">Aesthetically speaking, it&amp;#39;s
basically the same phone.</text><text start="47.4" dur="2.16">The side radii are squared off more,</text><text start="49.56" dur="2.13">so it feels a bit better
in the hand, sure,</text><text start="51.69" dur="1.95">much more boxy like the notes of the past.</text><text start="53.64" dur="3">They&amp;#39;re also slightly bigger
rings around the cameras,</text><text start="56.64" dur="3.27">and it&amp;#39;s Gorilla Glass Victus
2 instead of Victus Plus,</text><text start="59.91" dur="3.9">but as far as size, industrial
design, button placement,</text><text start="63.81" dur="3">ports, the layout, it&amp;#39;s
basically the same phone.</text><text start="66.81" dur="2.94">But there are two real
upgrades to this phone.</text><text start="69.75" dur="3.36">Now keep in mind, this is
replacing the Galaxy S22 Ultra,</text><text start="73.11" dur="3.48">which was already my best
big phone of the year</text><text start="76.59" dur="2.16">from last year, great battery,</text><text start="78.75" dur="1.44">great screen, great performance,</text><text start="80.19" dur="1.5">all of it was rock solid across the board,</text><text start="81.69" dur="2.91">so there&amp;#39;s not a lot that I
would naturally want to change.</text><text start="84.6" dur="1.5">But, there are two things,</text><text start="86.1" dur="1.83">and they&amp;#39;re two of arguably
the most important things</text><text start="87.93" dur="1.77">you can actually change in a phone,</text><text start="89.7" dur="2.43">the chip that runs it all and the cameras.</text><text start="92.13" dur="2.61">So you might have heard
about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.</text><text start="94.74" dur="1.86">It&amp;#39;s been a really good chip</text><text start="96.6" dur="1.38">in the other phones that it&amp;#39;s been in,</text><text start="97.98" dur="2.25">excellent CPU and GPU performance</text><text start="100.23" dur="2.79">and really efficient which
touches battery life.</text><text start="103.02" dur="3.12">Now, this phone, actually
the whole S23 lineup,</text><text start="106.14" dur="3.87">has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy,</text><text start="110.01" dur="2.22">a customized version of the chip,</text><text start="112.23" dur="2.04">specifically for these Samsung phones.</text><text start="114.27" dur="1.26">So if you watched the last video</text><text start="115.53" dur="1.62">about how Apple&amp;#39;s taking back the iPhone,</text><text start="117.15" dur="1.98">then you know already that optimization</text><text start="119.13" dur="1.916">and customization for parts inside phones</text><text start="121.046" dur="2.464">is a good thing, generally.</text><text start="123.51" dur="1.47">But the only thing that we&amp;#39;ve really seen</text><text start="124.98" dur="3.48">that is customized for
this chip for Galaxy</text><text start="128.46" dur="3.51">is a slightly higher max clock
speed on the performance core</text><text start="131.97" dur="2.04">and slightly higher
clock speed on the GPU.</text><text start="134.01" dur="4.2">So to be exact, 3.36GHz instead of 3.2</text><text start="138.21" dur="5">on the performance core and
719MHz versus 680 on the GPU.</text><text start="143.82" dur="3.12">So yeah, it does score
slightly better on benchmarks</text><text start="146.94" dur="2.58">than the regular Snapdragon
8 Gen 2, and that&amp;#39;s nice</text><text start="149.52" dur="2.46">for a little extra headroom
for high performance stuff,</text><text start="151.98" dur="2.01">light gaming and for future-proofing,</text><text start="153.99" dur="0.84">but that&amp;#39;s not the whole story.</text><text start="154.83" dur="1.56">There&amp;#39;s two main things that matter here,</text><text start="156.39" dur="2.16">one is efficiency gains.</text><text start="158.55" dur="1.8">So, obviously performance is awesome,</text><text start="160.35" dur="1.92">but because efficiency is better,</text><text start="162.27" dur="3.09">these phones get some
serious battery life gains</text><text start="165.36" dur="1.53">that we&amp;#39;ll talk in a second.</text><text start="166.89" dur="3.234">But also too, is bye-bye Exynos,</text><text start="170.124" dur="2.706">because they&amp;#39;re not making an
Exynos version of this phone</text><text start="172.83" dur="1.2">as far as I can tell anywhere else.</text><text start="174.03" dur="3.06">They&amp;#39;re shipping every S23
Ultra with a Qualcomm chip,</text><text start="177.09" dur="1.8">so everyone gets the efficiency</text><text start="178.89" dur="2.31">and performance gains
from the Qualcomm version.</text><text start="181.2" dur="2.22">So lemme tell you, the
battery life on this phone</text><text start="183.42" dur="2.22">is actually, it&amp;#39;s been incredible,</text><text start="185.64" dur="1.8">like it&amp;#39;s really, really good.</text><text start="187.44" dur="2.22">So it&amp;#39;s the 5,000 million power cell again</text><text start="189.66" dur="2.76">shouldn&amp;#39;t be a surprise,
but with this huge screen,</text><text start="192.42" dur="1.62">I guess it kind of is actually a surprise.</text><text start="194.04" dur="3.78">I had a two-day period at 120Hz but 1080P,</text><text start="197.82" dur="2.373">where the only time I charged it</text><text start="200.193" dur="2.427">was on the wireless charger in my car</text><text start="202.62" dur="1.62">on the way to and from the studio</text><text start="204.24" dur="1.53">for like the 40 minutes
that that drive is.</text><text start="205.77" dur="1.83">I didn&amp;#39;t charge it overnight
or anything like that.</text><text start="207.6" dur="2.88">Two full packed days of high brightness,</text><text start="210.48" dur="2.61">high intensity, normal use for me,</text><text start="213.09" dur="3.028">has something like eight and a
half hours of screen-on time.</text><text start="216.118" dur="4.472">I&amp;#39;m in bed at like 11:00 PM
at the end of the second day</text><text start="220.59" dur="1.56">streaming on YouTube live</text><text start="222.15" dur="2.19">watching LeBron break Kareem&amp;#39;s record,</text><text start="224.34" dur="2.85">it&amp;#39;s still got like 10%
left, it just won&amp;#39;t die.</text><text start="227.19" dur="1.86">So combine this excellent battery life</text><text start="229.05" dur="2.25">with a pretty solid 45 watt charging</text><text start="231.3" dur="3.87">that can go zero to 100 in an
hour, plus wireless charging,</text><text start="235.17" dur="3.39">and you&amp;#39;ve got yourself a
battery monster, it&amp;#39;s super good.</text><text start="238.56" dur="1.05">I don&amp;#39;t think enough people are talking</text><text start="239.61" dur="1.71">about how much better the battery got.</text><text start="241.32" dur="2.67">Maybe someone will do one of
those crazy long runtime demos</text><text start="243.99" dur="3.21">versus the past phone, but
yeah, it&amp;#39;s really good,</text><text start="247.2" dur="1.05">probably better than you think.</text><text start="248.25" dur="3.03">You kind of don&amp;#39;t ever
need to switch to 1080P</text><text start="251.28" dur="1.83">to save batteries, matter of fact,</text><text start="253.11" dur="1.29">when you take it out of the box,</text><text start="254.4" dur="3.6">immediately just go in
and switch it to 1440P,</text><text start="258" dur="1.47">&amp;#39;cause you spent 1200 bucks on this phone,</text><text start="259.47" dur="2.401">and it lasts forever, treat yourself.</text><text start="261.871" dur="2.639">Okay anyway, that&amp;#39;s the chips,
that&amp;#39;s what that enables,</text><text start="264.51" dur="1.59">but there&amp;#39;s also a new set of cameras,</text><text start="266.1" dur="2.25">hardware and software across the board</text><text start="268.35" dur="2.55">that also is better than you think.</text><text start="270.9" dur="2.37">Now, the fundamentals are mostly the same,</text><text start="273.27" dur="1.92">which is why this
probably gets written off</text><text start="275.19" dur="1.17">so quickly a lot.</text><text start="276.36" dur="2.73">The layout, the aesthetics,
the focal lengths,</text><text start="279.09" dur="2.22">the arrangement, it&amp;#39;s
all practically the same,</text><text start="281.31" dur="3.48">but we have a new
200-megapixel primary camera</text><text start="284.79" dur="3.54">with double the optical image
stabilization range as before.</text><text start="288.33" dur="1.38">That&amp;#39;s hugely important.</text><text start="289.71" dur="2.1">And then new sensors
across the ultra wide,</text><text start="291.81" dur="2.82">the 3X telephoto, and the
10X periscope cameras.</text><text start="294.63" dur="1.71">This new primary sensor setup though,</text><text start="296.34" dur="2.55">I know we keep saying
cameras are mostly software,</text><text start="298.89" dur="3.18">and as far as the look
and style of the photos,</text><text start="302.07" dur="2.4">it absolutely still
is, but the improvement</text><text start="304.47" dur="2.88">to the stabilization is so important here.</text><text start="307.35" dur="1.86">So when you go from a normal sensor</text><text start="309.21" dur="3.33">to a super-high resolution
200-megapixel sensor,</text><text start="312.54" dur="1.95">the fact is, in these
tiny smartphone cameras,</text><text start="314.49" dur="4.35">the individual pixels are
so small that individually,</text><text start="318.84" dur="2.73">they physically can&amp;#39;t
bring in that much light.</text><text start="321.57" dur="2.25">So the camera does this
thing called binning,</text><text start="323.82" dur="1.53">where it combines the information</text><text start="325.35" dur="1.86">from a bunch of adjacent pixels</text><text start="327.21" dur="3.45">to form larger more accurate
pixels in your image.</text><text start="330.66" dur="2.49">So you&amp;#39;re not shooting
200 megapixels by default,</text><text start="333.15" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s actually binning 16 pixels into one,</text><text start="336.54" dur="2.61">so you end up taking a 12.5 megapixel shot</text><text start="339.15" dur="2.01">for normal photos, but each photo</text><text start="341.16" dur="2.37">is theoretically more
accurate thanks to its makeup.</text><text start="343.53" dur="2.22">And then like I said, the
stabilization performance</text><text start="345.75" dur="3.031">on this new primary camera has doubled.</text><text start="348.781" dur="0.833">(phone rattles)</text><text start="349.614" dur="2.676">Still rattles a little bit,
but that means it&amp;#39;ll correct</text><text start="352.29" dur="3.48">up to three degrees of shake
now versus the 1.5 from before,</text><text start="355.77" dur="3.33">so here&amp;#39;s an example of what&amp;#39;s happening.</text><text start="359.1" dur="0.833">If you get a lens</text><text start="359.933" dur="1.796">with really good optical
image stabilization,</text><text start="361.729" dur="1.931">(lens rattles) like this one,</text><text start="363.66" dur="2.94">that means it can
correct from the movement</text><text start="366.6" dur="1.95">in your hand much more,</text><text start="368.55" dur="4.41">which means you can hold the
camera stable for much longer,</text><text start="372.96" dur="1.86">so it can leave the shutter open</text><text start="374.82" dur="3.45">to collect more light and
still get a sharp photo.</text><text start="378.27" dur="4.413">So, all of this is to say
Galaxy S23 Ultra photos,</text><text start="383.58" dur="2.25">most of the time, in most lighting,</text><text start="385.83" dur="1.44">look pretty similar to last year.</text><text start="387.27" dur="0.99">So if that&amp;#39;s all you&amp;#39;re looking at,</text><text start="388.26" dur="2.55">just normal side by sides,
this is mostly gonna come down</text><text start="390.81" dur="1.65">to the different software tuning,</text><text start="392.46" dur="2.46">and there&amp;#39;s a little bit more
dynamic range than last year,</text><text start="394.92" dur="1.65">but yeah, still top of the line</text><text start="396.57" dur="2.7">while mostly avoiding looking to HDR-y.</text><text start="399.27" dur="3.03">Photos are typically pretty
warm from these Samsung phones,</text><text start="402.3" dur="1.83">and they have a slightly punchier,</text><text start="404.13" dur="1.89">more contrasty look than before,</text><text start="406.02" dur="1.71">still very much up the Samsung alley</text><text start="407.73" dur="2.49">of colorful and saturated,
but it&amp;#39;s an aesthetic</text><text start="410.22" dur="2.19">that I can get behind, I really like.</text><text start="412.41" dur="2.7">But, on top of that,
having this new sensor</text><text start="415.11" dur="2.67">and optical stabilization means one,</text><text start="417.78" dur="3.51">you can shoot literally
200-megapixel photos now</text><text start="421.29" dur="1.41">if you really want to.</text><text start="422.7" dur="2.4">Now, this does accomplish
the intended purpose</text><text start="425.1" dur="3.27">of capturing much more of the finer detail</text><text start="428.37" dur="1.17">in things like landscapes,</text><text start="429.54" dur="1.98">so if you plan on zooming
in on the shot later,</text><text start="431.52" dur="1.59">or if you&amp;#39;re one of the
three people on earth</text><text start="433.11" dur="2.4">who will actually print
a smartphone photo,</text><text start="435.51" dur="2.04">this should work, but
you should also be aware</text><text start="437.55" dur="1.26">that it&amp;#39;s only really able</text><text start="438.81" dur="2.52">to give you these types of
results in excellent lighting</text><text start="441.33" dur="0.87">where a ton of light</text><text start="442.2" dur="2.55">is hitting every individual little pixel.</text><text start="444.75" dur="1.17">Anything short of that,</text><text start="445.92" dur="2.19">and you&amp;#39;re gonna get a
lot of noise really quick.</text><text start="448.11" dur="2.55">And there&amp;#39;s also a
really solid shutter lag</text><text start="450.66" dur="3.261">as it turns out these massive
40, 50 megabyte files,</text><text start="453.921" dur="3.369">granted this mode is mostly
for things sitting still,</text><text start="457.29" dur="2.52">like a landscape or a photo
shoot but worth noting.</text><text start="459.81" dur="1.23">I think the better compromise</text><text start="461.04" dur="3.66">is you actually also
get a 50-megapixel mode,</text><text start="464.7" dur="2.55">which kicks out still very detailed images</text><text start="467.25" dur="3.39">that hang right with the iPhone&amp;#39;s
48-megapixel ProRAW shots</text><text start="470.64" dur="2.88">in a variety of light, but now
the files are five megabytes,</text><text start="473.52" dur="1.53">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of less shutter lag.</text><text start="475.05" dur="1.41">But there&amp;#39;s still that improved detail</text><text start="476.46" dur="2.1">over the normal binge shots
and not as much noise.</text><text start="478.56" dur="1.32">It&amp;#39;s all about flexibility.</text><text start="479.88" dur="1.29">The standard mode is gonna be the best</text><text start="481.17" dur="1.38">for most shots most of the time,</text><text start="482.55" dur="1.74">but you can always turn
it up if you want to,</text><text start="484.29" dur="1.89">and that&amp;#39;s very much the
same thing with the zoom.</text><text start="486.18" dur="1.26">You see all the cameras on the back.</text><text start="487.44" dur="2.82">Any phone with two
different telephoto cameras</text><text start="490.26" dur="2.97">is gonna have the biggest
range of good zoom performance.</text><text start="493.23" dur="1.61">On this phone, anything past 10X</text><text start="494.84" dur="2.2">is where it really shines
compared to others.</text><text start="497.04" dur="1.41">And you might have even
seen my recent clip</text><text start="498.45" dur="2.61">of taking a photo of
the full moon recently,</text><text start="501.06" dur="3.72">which seems to blow people&amp;#39;s
minds every time they see it.</text><text start="504.78" dur="2.94">Wow, but you also can&amp;#39;t
forget about video too.</text><text start="507.72" dur="2.25">This is improved video across the board</text><text start="509.97" dur="2.46">with better processing, the new sensors,</text><text start="512.43" dur="4.11">and the much better stabilization,
thanks to the better OIS.</text><text start="516.54" dur="2.94">So this might be the
best super steady mode</text><text start="519.48" dur="2.31">I&amp;#39;ve ever seen in smartphone video,</text><text start="521.79" dur="3.12">and the beauty of it being
from optical stabilization</text><text start="524.91" dur="1.83">is it works great in
a variety of lighting,</text><text start="526.74" dur="2.61">unlike some electronic
image stabilization,</text><text start="529.35" dur="1.56">which relies on having a ton of light.</text><text start="530.91" dur="1.65">And on top of all of that,</text><text start="532.56" dur="4.273">the 8K video on this
smartphone is very usable.</text><text start="536.833" dur="2.147">There are previous phones
that have had 8K video,</text><text start="538.98" dur="1.2">it&amp;#39;s not the first,</text><text start="540.18" dur="2.4">but I remember when they
first got that capability,</text><text start="542.58" dur="1.89">they&amp;#39;d always be at like 24 FPS,</text><text start="544.47" dur="1.65">&amp;#39;cause that&amp;#39;s the most
that they could churn out,</text><text start="546.12" dur="4.86">which is not the right frame
rate, so 8K/30 really good.</text><text start="550.98" dur="1.5">And if you put it
side-by-side with the 4K,</text><text start="552.48" dur="1.8">you can actually see
the sharpness difference</text><text start="554.28" dur="1.14">if you really punch in.</text><text start="555.42" dur="1.35">If you want a sample of this,</text><text start="556.77" dur="2.55">the latest Auto Focus
video I shot in my car</text><text start="559.32" dur="1.89">is in 8K from this phone,</text><text start="561.21" dur="2.76">and you can actually go watch
it 8K on YouTube right now</text><text start="563.97" dur="2.61">from the link below, hit that
like button if you want to.</text><text start="566.58" dur="0.833">Oh yeah, and also,</text><text start="567.413" dur="2.017">don&amp;#39;t forget about the better selfies too.</text><text start="569.43" dur="2.52">There&amp;#39;s a new 12 megapixel selfie camera</text><text start="571.95" dur="1.31">in all these S23 phones.</text><text start="573.26" dur="3.16">And while that number is lower on paper</text><text start="576.42" dur="1.71">than the 40 megapixel selfie camera</text><text start="578.13" dur="2.959">that came before it, it&amp;#39;s better.</text><text start="581.089" dur="2.111">It&amp;#39;s just better, rock solid proof</text><text start="583.2" dur="1.71">that the megapixels don&amp;#39;t matter.</text><text start="584.91" dur="2.73">This selfie camera, with the
better software processing,</text><text start="587.64" dur="3.15">is very sharp, detailed, has nice color,</text><text start="590.79" dur="2.82">doesn&amp;#39;t flare too much, and
also has a decently wide angle.</text><text start="593.61" dur="1.65">It&amp;#39;s not ultra-wide but not bad.</text><text start="595.26" dur="3.03">So across the board, this is significant,</text><text start="598.29" dur="2.1">an extensive improvement to the camera,</text><text start="600.39" dur="1.53">especially the primary camera.</text><text start="601.92" dur="1.59">That feels overlooked to me</text><text start="603.51" dur="1.747">when people have been reviewing the phone.</text><text start="605.257" dur="2.663">The one thing I still will complain about</text><text start="607.92" dur="1.71">is there is still shutter lag,</text><text start="609.63" dur="2.61">which is different from
slow shutter speed.</text><text start="612.24" dur="2.49">So the time gap between
hitting the shutter button</text><text start="614.73" dur="2.94">and actually capturing the
photo, it&amp;#39;s still real,</text><text start="617.67" dur="1.14">and it can still be kind of annoying,</text><text start="618.81" dur="2.97">even if you capture a crisp
photo of the wrong moment.</text><text start="621.78" dur="1.89">So, like I said, it&amp;#39;s more pronounced</text><text start="623.67" dur="2.37">when you take the ultra
high resolution 50-megapixel</text><text start="626.04" dur="1.35">or 200-megapixel photos.</text><text start="627.39" dur="1.95">You can&amp;#39;t exactly do those in rapid fire.</text><text start="629.34" dur="1.027">But if the question is,</text><text start="630.367" dur="1.8">&amp;quot;Did they make a meaningful improvement</text><text start="632.167" dur="2.085">&amp;quot;to last year&amp;#39;s phone to end up here?&amp;quot;</text><text start="634.252" dur="2.798">I would say between the new chip</text><text start="637.05" dur="1.59">and the better overall performance,</text><text start="638.64" dur="1.11">and much better efficiency,</text><text start="639.75" dur="2.52">which gets you huge
battery life improvement,</text><text start="642.27" dur="2.49">and the new cameras
with the better sensors,</text><text start="644.76" dur="3.316">better processing, but also
much better stabilization,</text><text start="648.076" dur="4.512">I would say yes, not upgrade
from last year&amp;#39;s phone, yes,</text><text start="652.588" dur="2.072">but they&amp;#39;ve actually
made a real improvement.</text><text start="654.66" dur="2.31">And then, I don&amp;#39;t really need
to say too much about the rest</text><text start="656.97" dur="2.04">because it&amp;#39;s the same as before,</text><text start="659.01" dur="2.698">which, in the case of the
best big phone of last year,</text><text start="661.708" dur="1.532">is kind of a good thing.</text><text start="663.24" dur="2.19">All the other things that
made this the best big phone</text><text start="665.43" dur="2.91">are still here, and they&amp;#39;re
not minor things either.</text><text start="668.34" dur="2.61">I haven&amp;#39;t even talked
about the A+ display,</text><text start="670.95" dur="5">1440P, 120Hz LTPO, 1,750
nits peak brightness,</text><text start="676.2" dur="2.7">it&amp;#39;s still awesome,
still has great speakers,</text><text start="678.9" dur="1.71">still has very reliable software</text><text start="680.61" dur="1.95">with a pretty good track record now</text><text start="682.56" dur="1.29">of delivering software updates</text><text start="683.85" dur="2.19">in a timely fashion for a while.</text><text start="686.04" dur="2.49">The base storage has
also actually jumped up</text><text start="688.53" dur="5">from 128 to 256 gigs, and it&amp;#39;s
faster UFS 4.0 storage now.</text><text start="694.23" dur="2.97">It still has the best stylus
in a smartphone in the world,</text><text start="697.2" dur="2.04">which might mean a lot more
to you than it does to me,</text><text start="699.24" dur="1.98">but, honestly, if I ever use it,</text><text start="701.22" dur="1.65">it&amp;#39;s nice knowing I can at any time</text><text start="702.87" dur="2.49">mark up a screenshot or sign a PDF.</text><text start="705.36" dur="1.86">And the list goes on, great haptic motor,</text><text start="707.22" dur="2.55">nice clicky buttons, it&amp;#39;s all still here.</text><text start="709.77" dur="2.64">This thing sets the standard pretty high.</text><text start="712.41" dur="1.47">My analogy that I was making</text><text start="713.88" dur="3.72">is that it feels like the
portion 9/11 of smartphones.</text><text start="717.6" dur="2.76">If you&amp;#39;re gonna charge
1200 bucks for a phone,</text><text start="720.36" dur="2.19">it better set high marks all
the way across the board,</text><text start="722.55" dur="2.13">but it does, and it&amp;#39;s pretty underrated,</text><text start="724.68" dur="1.89">kind of boring, but it does.</text><text start="726.57" dur="1.5">Now, if you want the S23 Ultra</text><text start="728.07" dur="3.12">to look as improved as it actually is,</text><text start="731.19" dur="2.19">I would recommend a skin from
channel sponsored, dbrand,</text><text start="733.38" dur="1.95">maybe something like this Damascus skin,</text><text start="735.33" dur="1.2">which adds a lot of character,</text><text start="736.53" dur="2.61">where it would ordinarily be pretty blank.</text><text start="739.14" dur="1.29">My favorite one is the Triple Black.</text><text start="740.43" dur="1.26">It is actually included for free</text><text start="741.69" dur="2.25">when you pick up any of
the holographic colorways,</text><text start="743.94" dur="2.28">so you can check &amp;#39;em
out at the link below.</text><text start="746.22" dur="1.26">I say this phone is boring,</text><text start="747.48" dur="3.127">and I think maybe understated
is the better word.</text><text start="750.607" dur="2.693">Are there gonna be other
phones that come out this year</text><text start="753.3" dur="3.949">that do one up this phone in
certain single categories?</text><text start="757.249" dur="2.591">Yeah, 100%, there&amp;#39;s probably gonna be</text><text start="759.84" dur="2.49">a phone with 120X zoom.</text><text start="762.33" dur="3.81">There&amp;#39;s probably gonna be a
phone with crazy fast charging.</text><text start="766.14" dur="2.76">This is only 45 watt charging.
Do I wish this was better?</text><text start="768.9" dur="1.26">A little bit, sometimes.</text><text start="770.16" dur="1.02">Is there gonna be a phone probably</text><text start="771.18" dur="2.41">with a much bigger, better,
faster fingerprint reader?</text><text start="773.59" dur="1.547">(soft bright music)
Yeah, probably.</text><text start="775.137" dur="3.273">But as far as just nailing all
the marks across the board,</text><text start="778.41" dur="0.84">yeah, this does it.</text><text start="779.25" dur="1.35">Just as far as overall package,</text><text start="780.6" dur="4.47">Samsung&amp;#39;s software is settled,
the screen is sublime,</text><text start="785.07" dur="2.01">it&amp;#39;s still the sickest stylus,</text><text start="787.08" dur="3.813">and it&amp;#39;s snaps significantly
smoother shots, sick.</text><text start="791.776" dur="4.033">Thanks for watching, catch you
guys in the next one, peace.</text><text start="795.809" dur="3.417">(bright music continues)</text></transcript>
