waited patiently for this.</text><text start="4.89" dur="1.11">Once again, this year,</text><text start="6" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;ve run our blind
smartphone camera test,</text><text start="9.24" dur="1.02">scientific style.</text><text start="10.26" dur="1.38">We always think we know</text><text start="11.64" dur="2.1">what the absolute best
smartphone cameras are,</text><text start="13.74" dur="2.07">but do we actually know?</text><text start="15.81" dur="2.13">Like what if we wanted an objective answer</text><text start="17.94" dur="1.68">straight from real-world data?</text><text start="19.62" dur="1.26">Literally every time I review a phone,</text><text start="20.88" dur="1.807">there&amp;#39;s some people in the
comments section saying,</text><text start="22.687" dur="2.603">&amp;quot;Oh, iPhone photos are
the only good ones,&amp;quot;</text><text start="25.29" dur="1.8">or, &amp;quot;I only like Pixel photos,&amp;quot;</text><text start="27.09" dur="2.85">or, &amp;quot;Samsung is the only one
who does good portrait mode.&amp;quot;</text><text start="29.94" dur="1.77">But what if we put that to the test?</text><text start="31.71" dur="0.87">What if we took a bunch</text><text start="32.58" dur="1.89">of the best smartphone
cameras on the planet</text><text start="34.47" dur="1.53">and took them out into the real world</text><text start="36" dur="1.68">and took the exact same photo</text><text start="37.68" dur="1.74">with each and every one of them,</text><text start="39.42" dur="2.01">and then strip them of all their labels,</text><text start="41.43" dur="1.86">and then had you, the public,</text><text start="43.29" dur="3.09">vote on which one&amp;#39;s
photos you like the best?</text><text start="46.38" dur="3.84">That should reveal the best
actual smartphone camera.</text><text start="50.22" dur="1.14">So that&amp;#39;s exactly what we did.</text><text start="51.36" dur="3.54">This year, we took these 20 smartphones,</text><text start="54.9" dur="1.38">updated all of their software,</text><text start="56.28" dur="0.9">charged &amp;#39;em all up,</text><text start="57.18" dur="1.56">got their batteries to 100%.</text><text start="58.74" dur="2.55">Then we went out and took
the same three photos</text><text start="61.29" dur="0.99">with each one.</text><text start="62.28" dur="1.56">One daytime photo,</text><text start="63.84" dur="1.38">one low-light photo,</text><text start="65.22" dur="2.46">and one portrait-mode photo.</text><text start="67.68" dur="1.8">Yes, it is surprisingly
hard to stay perfectly still</text><text start="69.48" dur="2.34">for 20 identical photos
to be taken in a row,</text><text start="71.82" dur="1.05">but I did it for you.</text><text start="72.87" dur="1.68">Then we had to go in and
import all the photos</text><text start="74.55" dur="1.29">from every single smartphone camera,</text><text start="75.84" dur="1.11">harder than you think,</text><text start="76.95" dur="1.62">strip them of all their EXIF data,</text><text start="78.57" dur="2.31">and then upload them to
a site that we&amp;#39;ve built</text><text start="80.88" dur="1.86">that lets us put them side by side</text><text start="82.74" dur="2.28">for you guys to vote on head-to-head</text><text start="85.02" dur="2.79">millions and millions
and millions of times,</text><text start="87.81" dur="1.23">which you did.</text><text start="89.04" dur="0.833">That should give us</text><text start="89.873" dur="2.737">a statistically significant winner,</text><text start="92.61" dur="1.5">and loser, we&amp;#39;ll get to that.</text><text start="94.11" dur="1.47">And the results this year</text><text start="95.58" dur="2.67">were kind of interesting, a little bit.</text><text start="98.25" dur="1.23">I almost didn&amp;#39;t make this video,</text><text start="99.48" dur="1.68">but I can tell people have been waiting,</text><text start="101.16" dur="1.86">the competitive tension is high,</text><text start="103.02" dur="1.77">and the actual results</text><text start="104.79" dur="1.35">might be a little
surprising to some of you.</text><text start="106.14" dur="1.71">So let&amp;#39;s get into it.</text><text start="107.85" dur="1.47">So the data our site spits out</text><text start="109.32" dur="1.62">all comes in these text files</text><text start="110.94" dur="1.14">with matchup ratings</text><text start="112.08" dur="2.82">for every single
combination of smartphones.</text><text start="114.9" dur="1.26">We actually had them coded</text><text start="116.16" dur="1.74">by letters of the alphabet you can see,</text><text start="117.9" dur="1.32">A through T.</text><text start="119.22" dur="1.05">But that little number,</text><text start="120.27" dur="2.4">that one right here is the most important.</text><text start="122.67" dur="2.01">That is the Elo rating.</text><text start="124.68" dur="3.03">You know, the system
that ranks chess players,</text><text start="127.71" dur="2.07">or tennis players, basically
anything head-to-head.</text><text start="129.78" dur="1.86">With enough matchup information,</text><text start="131.64" dur="2.88">we can sort of sort through
all of these letters</text><text start="134.52" dur="1.41">based on who they beat</text><text start="135.93" dur="0.96">and who they lose to,</text><text start="136.89" dur="2.01">and create a power rankings,</text><text start="138.9" dur="2.04">and that will give us our winners.</text><text start="140.94" dur="2.43">So the question you
probably all wanna know,</text><text start="143.37" dur="1.65">who were the winners?</text><text start="145.02" dur="2.37">And so we&amp;#39;ll go category by category</text><text start="147.39" dur="2.22">because, like I said, there
were three different scenarios,</text><text start="149.61" dur="2.4">daytime, low light and portrait mode,</text><text start="152.01" dur="1.08">so let&amp;#39;s go one by one.</text><text start="153.09" dur="2.49">So daytime, for the
regular daylight photos,</text><text start="155.58" dur="0.87">we kinda had it set up</text><text start="156.45" dur="1.86">with just me sitting in
front of this window here,</text><text start="158.31" dur="1.35">but there&amp;#39;s a lot to this photo.</text><text start="159.66" dur="2.01">The strongest light is
from inside the room,</text><text start="161.67" dur="1.17">but then the window light</text><text start="162.84" dur="2.49">is actually a good test of dynamic range.</text><text start="165.33" dur="1.71">And then there&amp;#39;s also a variety of colors,</text><text start="167.04" dur="1.23">there&amp;#39;s my skin tone,</text><text start="168.27" dur="2.67">there&amp;#39;s the orange chair
next to the blue pillow,</text><text start="170.94" dur="1.05">a few other things.</text><text start="171.99" dur="0.833">This is on purpose,</text><text start="172.823" dur="1.357">there&amp;#39;s no individual variable</text><text start="174.18" dur="1.71">that can dominate this test.</text><text start="175.89" dur="1.59">So every single phone,</text><text start="177.48" dur="2.58">we try to frame the exact same way,</text><text start="180.06" dur="1.35">from the exact same spot,</text><text start="181.41" dur="1.44">holding one of &amp;#39;em up as a reference</text><text start="182.85" dur="1.8">so we can get as close as possible.</text><text start="184.65" dur="1.35">And everything is fully auto,</text><text start="186" dur="1.59">we just open the camera app,</text><text start="187.59" dur="1.08">make sure the lens is clean</text><text start="188.67" dur="1.17">and just hit the shutter button.</text><text start="189.84" dur="1.17">We don&amp;#39;t even tap to focus,</text><text start="191.01" dur="2.4">just point and shoot.</text><text start="193.41" dur="3.42">It takes about six minutes
to go through all 20 phones.</text><text start="196.83" dur="1.47">Like I said, it&amp;#39;s kinda hard to sit still</text><text start="198.3" dur="1.74">for six minutes straight, but we did it.</text><text start="200.04" dur="1.83">So for this regular
daylight photo situation,</text><text start="201.87" dur="4.963">the winner with the highest
Elo rating is the Pixel 7A.</text><text start="208.59" dur="0.84">That&amp;#39;s pretty impressive.</text><text start="209.43" dur="2.61">So this is the photo that
you guys, for the most part,</text><text start="212.04" dur="3.03">voted as the winner in
most of its matchups.</text><text start="215.07" dur="1.56">Pretty neutral photo, to be honest,</text><text start="216.63" dur="2.1">not too bright, not too dark,</text><text start="218.73" dur="2.34">pretty excellent dynamic range.</text><text start="221.07" dur="1.14">And it&amp;#39;s also not a fluke</text><text start="222.21" dur="1.68">because the second-highest Elo rating</text><text start="223.89" dur="1.77">came from the Pixel Fold.</text><text start="225.66" dur="2.01">So the Fold took a very similar photo.</text><text start="227.67" dur="2.04">And then finishing up on the podium</text><text start="229.71" dur="2.04">was the OnePlus Open,</text><text start="231.75" dur="2.43">one of those high-end folding phones.</text><text start="234.18" dur="2.31">So I will say, my personal favorite photo</text><text start="236.49" dur="1.86">and the one that actually won for me</text><text start="238.35" dur="1.77">when I blind tested myself</text><text start="240.12" dur="1.14">was this one.</text><text start="241.26" dur="2.43">This is the fourth-highest Elo rating,</text><text start="243.69" dur="1.35">this is the OnePlus 11.</text><text start="245.04" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s definitely a little
on the contrastier side,</text><text start="246.72" dur="1.05">but a little more confident</text><text start="247.77" dur="0.99">with nailing the exposure</text><text start="248.76" dur="1.44">and having dynamic range.</text><text start="250.2" dur="2.07">Nevertheless, it&amp;#39;s
definitely interesting here.</text><text start="252.27" dur="3.51">A lot of people pointed
out that the sun behind me</text><text start="255.78" dur="1.22">looked a little different in each photo.</text><text start="257" dur="1.12">It might&amp;#39;ve been setting,</text><text start="258.12" dur="1.83">so the background was a little different,</text><text start="259.95" dur="1.2">which is a little bit true,</text><text start="261.15" dur="1.38">but it wasn&amp;#39;t late enough in the day</text><text start="262.53" dur="2.49">for that to actually affect the photo.</text><text start="265.02" dur="1.26">I think the fact that the 7A</text><text start="266.28" dur="2.22">is the only one with
this little lens flare</text><text start="268.5" dur="2.19">is actually just a coincidence.</text><text start="270.69" dur="2.04">And then fun fact, in dead last</text><text start="272.73" dur="3.24">with the absolute bottom-lowest Elo rating</text><text start="275.97" dur="1.12">for this daytime photo</text><text start="278.58" dur="1.443">is the iPhone 15 Pro.</text><text start="280.95" dur="1.17">Not a terrible photo.</text><text start="282.12" dur="1.74">I mean, you can&amp;#39;t really
get a horrible photo</text><text start="283.86" dur="1.29">in normal-looking lighting</text><text start="285.15" dur="1.14">for most of these smartphones,</text><text start="286.29" dur="2.37">but when you put it up against the others,</text><text start="288.66" dur="1.89">it&amp;#39;s mostly just the darkest one.</text><text start="290.55" dur="1.32">And so when you put it up side-by-side</text><text start="291.87" dur="1.29">against these much brighter photos,</text><text start="293.16" dur="1.59">people just picked the brighter one</text><text start="294.75" dur="1.8">almost every single time.</text><text start="296.55" dur="0.84">Funnily enough, though,</text><text start="297.39" dur="3.42">you can absolutely overexpose
for this competition,</text><text start="300.81" dur="2.22">as the second-lowest Elo rating</text><text start="303.03" dur="2.19">belongs to the Galaxy S23 Ultra</text><text start="305.22" dur="3.75">for producing this weirdly
overexposed masterpiece.</text><text start="308.97" dur="2.22">So here are all the photos side-by-side</text><text start="311.19" dur="1.08">with their Elo ratings.</text><text start="312.27" dur="0.84">Feel free to pause it</text><text start="313.11" dur="2.28">if you&amp;#39;d like to make
some more observations,</text><text start="315.39" dur="2.76">but let&amp;#39;s move on to the nighttime photos.</text><text start="318.15" dur="3.33">So low light, low light is
a much more challenging shot</text><text start="321.48" dur="1.17">for a smartphone camera,</text><text start="322.65" dur="2.31">especially with a tiny
sensor and tiny optics</text><text start="324.96" dur="2.1">trying to take in as
much light as possible.</text><text start="327.06" dur="2.88">But computational photography
has come a long way,</text><text start="329.94" dur="2.07">and even in this pretty dark rooftop</text><text start="332.01" dur="3.69">where the only light source
was like 40 feet away from me,</text><text start="335.7" dur="2.28">these cameras still
managed to do a good job.</text><text start="337.98" dur="1.65">And if you&amp;#39;re ready for the plot twist,</text><text start="339.63" dur="2.1">the highest overall Elo rating</text><text start="341.73" dur="1.62">for the low-light photo</text><text start="343.35" dur="4.02">comes from, dead last
from the daylight photo,</text><text start="347.37" dur="3.24">it is again the iPhone 15 Pro,</text><text start="350.61" dur="3.6">with another totally reasonable photo.</text><text start="354.21" dur="2.28">Now, following it very
closely in second place</text><text start="356.49" dur="1.98">was the Pixel 8 Pro.</text><text start="358.47" dur="3.42">And actually the Pixel 7A coming in third.</text><text start="361.89" dur="2.52">And to be honest, I fully
agree with all of these.</text><text start="364.41" dur="2.01">It&amp;#39;s starting to get ridiculous</text><text start="366.42" dur="3">how much some of the
other smartphone cameras</text><text start="369.42" dur="1.56">started to pump up the light,</text><text start="370.98" dur="2.85">like literally the second
you get outside the top four,</text><text start="373.83" dur="2.91">you get straight into bad HDR territory.</text><text start="376.74" dur="3.36">Like this is the fifth-place
photo from S23 Ultra,</text><text start="380.1" dur="1.47">which is definitely too bright.</text><text start="381.57" dur="3.06">And also, you can see this
little HDR halo-y effect</text><text start="384.63" dur="1.71">starting to show up around my head.</text><text start="386.34" dur="2.25">And then if you scroll all the way down</text><text start="388.59" dur="2.7">to the Oppo Find X6 Pro,</text><text start="391.29" dur="2.52">just, my God, what happened?</text><text start="393.81" dur="1.83">Like these cameras are going nuts.</text><text start="395.64" dur="1.08">It looks like in this one</text><text start="396.72" dur="2.19">they literally painted sloppily over me</text><text start="398.91" dur="2.25">and just dragged up the exposure.</text><text start="401.16" dur="0.833">Matter of fact.</text><text start="401.993" dur="2.257">(pencil scratching)</text><text start="404.25" dur="0.833">Yep, see?</text><text start="405.083" dur="1.627">That&amp;#39;s exactly what it looks like.</text><text start="406.71" dur="1.29">The Zenfone did this, too,</text><text start="408" dur="1.41">along with a few others.</text><text start="409.41" dur="2.19">And I honestly think the OnePlus Open</text><text start="411.6" dur="2.16">not only made me brighter,</text><text start="413.76" dur="2.07">but then it also identified the sky</text><text start="415.83" dur="2.01">and made the sky darker,</text><text start="417.84" dur="2.4">which just then starts to look ridiculous.</text><text start="420.24" dur="2.7">I mean, real life looked
nothing like this.</text><text start="422.94" dur="2.34">So here are all the nighttime photos,</text><text start="425.28" dur="1.38">and their Elo ratings.</text><text start="426.66" dur="1.41">Pause it if you need it.</text><text start="428.07" dur="2.58">And now we can move to the
last-but-not-least category,</text><text start="430.65" dur="0.833">portrait mode.</text><text start="431.483" dur="2.377">So portrait mode kind of turns
out to be the hardest test,</text><text start="433.86" dur="0.93">like this to run</text><text start="434.79" dur="1.44">because they all kinda do portrait mode</text><text start="436.23" dur="0.99">a little bit differently.</text><text start="437.22" dur="1.62">If you just open the camera app</text><text start="438.84" dur="1.08">and switch to portrait mode,</text><text start="439.92" dur="1.047">some of &amp;#39;em do 2X,</text><text start="440.967" dur="1.166">some of &amp;#39;em are 3X,</text><text start="442.133" dur="1.627">some of &amp;#39;em say 1X,</text><text start="443.76" dur="1.71">but they&amp;#39;re actually like 1.5X,</text><text start="445.47" dur="0.833">it&amp;#39;s kinda weird.</text><text start="446.303" dur="1.597">So we tried to just keep
it simple for this test</text><text start="447.9" dur="1.29">and just open the camera app,</text><text start="449.19" dur="0.96">switch to portrait mode,</text><text start="450.15" dur="1.89">and then move our feet forward or backward</text><text start="452.04" dur="1.8">to try to match the focal length</text><text start="453.84" dur="1.77">with all of these shots.</text><text start="455.61" dur="0.833">It kinda worked,</text><text start="456.443" dur="2.797">and they all kinda also
have different bokeh levels,</text><text start="459.24" dur="0.96">some of &amp;#39;em are adjustable,</text><text start="460.2" dur="0.9">some of &amp;#39;em aren&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="461.1" dur="2.04">But like I said, we&amp;#39;re just
going with the default,</text><text start="463.14" dur="1.74">the point and shoot that
most people will get</text><text start="464.88" dur="1.2">when they do it.</text><text start="466.08" dur="2.43">And the portrait-mode,
point-and-shoot winner</text><text start="468.51" dur="2.01">with the highest Elo rating</text><text start="470.52" dur="1.98">is the Pixel 8 Pro.</text><text start="472.5" dur="3.93">This was followed pretty
closely by Samsung Z Fold 5,</text><text start="476.43" dur="2.04">which I actually think
had a better cutout.</text><text start="478.47" dur="2.31">And then the third-highest Elo here</text><text start="480.78" dur="1.41">was the iPhone 15 Pro,</text><text start="482.19" dur="2.34">which I think had the
most natural-looking blur.</text><text start="484.53" dur="1.77">But basically all of
these podium finishers</text><text start="486.3" dur="2.31">have relatively subtle portrait modes,</text><text start="488.61" dur="1.8">nothing too dramatic,</text><text start="490.41" dur="2.37">and then pretty good
detail and overall balance</text><text start="492.78" dur="1.23">in just the rest of the photo.</text><text start="494.01" dur="2.46">I say this because the losers here</text><text start="496.47" dur="2.01">in this particular category</text><text start="498.48" dur="1.307">were nothing like this.</text><text start="499.787" dur="3.283">(laughing) They were some of
the wonkiest, weirdest photos</text><text start="503.07" dur="0.87">in the entire competition.</text><text start="503.94" dur="3.06">And the loser with the
absolute lowest Elo rating</text><text start="507" dur="0.93">for this category,</text><text start="507.93" dur="1.89">and actually in any category,</text><text start="509.82" dur="3.54">was the Sony Xperia 1 V</text><text start="513.36" dur="2.313">with this photo,</text><text start="517.14" dur="2.76">with that, that&amp;#39;s the photo?</text><text start="519.9" dur="2.19">Like, okay, this one looks like a mistake.</text><text start="522.09" dur="3.03">We all actually thought it
was a mistake as we shot it,</text><text start="525.12" dur="1.92">like, &amp;quot;This can&amp;#39;t
possibly be right, right?&amp;quot;</text><text start="527.04" dur="2.25">We clean the lens, we take it again,</text><text start="529.29" dur="1.5">it does it again.</text><text start="530.79" dur="1.74">And then it did it again and again.</text><text start="532.53" dur="3.03">So I mean, I guess, for whatever reason,</text><text start="535.56" dur="2.64">this $1,200 Android flagship phone</text><text start="538.2" dur="2.1">in its auto portrait mode</text><text start="540.3" dur="2.4">just could not handle this lighting,</text><text start="542.7" dur="1.98">it had some weird issues.</text><text start="544.68" dur="2.37">Anyway, here&amp;#39;s all of
the portrait-mode photos</text><text start="547.05" dur="1.65">and their Elo ratings.</text><text start="548.7" dur="0.833">You&amp;#39;re welcome.</text><text start="549.533" dur="1.627">I&amp;#39;d like to give out some awards.</text><text start="551.16" dur="1.8">Now that we have all of our matchup data</text><text start="552.96" dur="2.37">and all of our voting and
all of our Elo ratings</text><text start="555.33" dur="1.56">from across every single person</text><text start="556.89" dur="1.65">for what you guys voted for</text><text start="558.54" dur="2.73">for more than 20 million total votes,</text><text start="561.27" dur="1.62">there&amp;#39;s some pretty
interesting stuff here.</text><text start="562.89" dur="1.2">So we have our winners and losers</text><text start="564.09" dur="1.92">in each of the three
categories, which is cool,</text><text start="566.01" dur="2.97">but if you average it all together,</text><text start="568.98" dur="3.45">we have the highest
overall average Elo rating.</text><text start="572.43" dur="2.19">We&amp;#39;ll call this one the People&amp;#39;s Champ.</text><text start="574.62" dur="3.06">And with the highest average of 1,660,</text><text start="577.68" dur="1.563">that&amp;#39;s pretty competitive.</text><text start="580.11" dur="1.95">It was the Pixel 7A.</text><text start="582.06" dur="2.04">So this one won the daytime photo,</text><text start="584.1" dur="0.87">as you probably remember,</text><text start="584.97" dur="3.21">but then it also came in third
place in the nighttime photo</text><text start="588.18" dur="3.6">and fourth place of all 20
in the portrait-mode photo.</text><text start="591.78" dur="2.16">So that&amp;#39;s pretty strong.</text><text start="593.94" dur="1.86">But here&amp;#39;s the kicker,</text><text start="595.8" dur="2.26">the second-highest average Elo rating</text><text start="599.16" dur="2.34">was the Pixel 8 Pro,</text><text start="601.5" dur="2.31">and the third-highest average Elo rating,</text><text start="603.81" dur="1.623">again, this is your votes,</text><text start="606.72" dur="1.68">is the Pixel Fold.</text><text start="608.4" dur="1.8">So Pixel, Pixel, Pixel,</text><text start="610.2" dur="2.28">it&amp;#39;s a perfect Pixel podium.</text><text start="612.48" dur="1.77">So here you can see the whole list</text><text start="614.25" dur="0.96">from top to bottom.</text><text start="615.21" dur="1.32">The three Pixels at the top,</text><text start="616.53" dur="2.08">surprisingly in reverse price order.</text><text start="618.61" dur="2.66">(laughing) And then bringing
up the rear for total Elo</text><text start="621.27" dur="2.52">is the Sony Xperia 1 V</text><text start="623.79" dur="1.47">and the Xiaomi 13 Ultra.</text><text start="625.26" dur="2.28">Then I also had to bring back
the Bang for the Buck Award,</text><text start="627.54" dur="1.59">which I did this last year also,</text><text start="629.13" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s basically just
most votes from you guys</text><text start="632.43" dur="2.85">divided by MSRP at launch.</text><text start="635.28" dur="2.34">So most votes per dollar, basically.</text><text start="637.62" dur="1.08">And so your winner, again,</text><text start="638.7" dur="1.53">is going to be the Pixel 7A.</text><text start="640.23" dur="2.46">This was a phone that launched
right around 500 bucks.</text><text start="642.69" dur="1.44">It did incredible on the tests.</text><text start="644.13" dur="3.06">But in second place in votes per dollar</text><text start="647.19" dur="2.13">is the Nothing Phone 2.</text><text start="649.32" dur="1.83">So a pretty good-performing phone,</text><text start="651.15" dur="1.98">and it actually launched
like upper mid-range price.</text><text start="653.13" dur="2.7">So this is a good phone
bang for the buck-wise.</text><text start="655.83" dur="2.28">And then in 3A, 3B,</text><text start="658.11" dur="1.59">right next to each other
underneath these two,</text><text start="659.7" dur="2.94">you have the OnePlus
11 and the Zenfone 10.</text><text start="662.64" dur="1.41">And then impressively, actually the Sony</text><text start="664.05" dur="1.59">is not dead last in this category,</text><text start="665.64" dur="2.22">it is expensive and it
did perform horribly,</text><text start="667.86" dur="2.43">but not worse bang for the buck-wise</text><text start="670.29" dur="1.95">than a super-expensive folding phone,</text><text start="672.24" dur="3.06">the Z Flip5 overall average</text><text start="675.3" dur="2.91">did worse for the dollar,
the more you know.</text><text start="678.21" dur="1.74">So what did we learn with all this?</text><text start="679.95" dur="1.38">Well, I&amp;#39;ll leave you with this.</text><text start="681.33" dur="2.01">First of all, the Pixels killed it,</text><text start="683.34" dur="1.35">they had the one-two-three finish,</text><text start="684.69" dur="1.14">they&amp;#39;re great bang for the buck.</text><text start="685.83" dur="2.7">It was weird that they&amp;#39;re
inverse price order, but fine.</text><text start="688.53" dur="3.06">But also there&amp;#39;s a lot more
to a smartphone camera,</text><text start="691.59" dur="3.42">of course, than just a
sitting-down, staged photo</text><text start="695.01" dur="0.9">of a person.</text><text start="695.91" dur="3.3">We learned a little bit about
how it shoots my skin tones.</text><text start="699.21" dur="1.98">There&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of other
things you might care about,</text><text start="701.19" dur="1.953">from auto-focus speed, to the UI,</text><text start="703.98" dur="2.85">to the actual file format,
how editable it is,</text><text start="706.83" dur="3.39">to videos, like there&amp;#39;s
a bunch more to it.</text><text start="710.22" dur="1.65">But at the end of the day,</text><text start="711.87" dur="3.48">I think we were still pretty not shocked</text><text start="715.35" dur="1.86">by the slightly brighter photos</text><text start="717.21" dur="2.55">beating the slightly less bright photos.</text><text start="719.76" dur="1.29">And maybe we&amp;#39;ll run it
back again next year</text><text start="721.05" dur="1.56">and learn something new.</text><text start="722.61" dur="2.7">Either way, thanks for watching this one.</text><text start="725.31" dur="0.833">Catch you guys next time.</text><text start="726.143" dur="1.313">Peace.</text><text start="727.456" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
