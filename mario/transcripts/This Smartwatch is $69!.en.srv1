type it, is it though?</text><text start="16.89" dur="1.17">Is it really that nice?</text><text start="18.06" dur="1.14">Is it that good?</text><text start="19.2" dur="1.44">I feel like we should define good first,</text><text start="20.64" dur="1.357">because going into this, I was thinking,</text><text start="21.997" dur="1.08">&amp;quot;Just the fact that you can get</text><text start="23.077" dur="2.993">&amp;quot;a fully functioning
smartwatch for $69 in 2023,&amp;quot;</text><text start="26.07" dur="2.94">just that by itself, on its
face, was kind of amazing.</text><text start="29.01" dur="0.833">&amp;#39;Cause we live in a world</text><text start="29.843" dur="1.387">where you can easily spend hundreds</text><text start="31.23" dur="1.71">and hundreds of dollars on a smartwatch.</text><text start="32.94" dur="1.56">But clearly, there&amp;#39;s a wide spectrum</text><text start="34.5" dur="1.71">of what these things can be capable of.</text><text start="36.21" dur="3.39">So this one, just the simple stuff, right?</text><text start="39.6" dur="3.96">Just the basics, the time,
notifications, step counter,</text><text start="43.56" dur="2.58">heart rate, calorie
counter, sleep tracking,</text><text start="46.14" dur="2.25">just on its face, that&amp;#39;s good enough</text><text start="48.39" dur="2.73">for 95% of people, right?</text><text start="51.12" dur="1.5">Well, let&amp;#39;s just start
with the basics here.</text><text start="52.62" dur="2.37">This is a square smartwatch.</text><text start="54.99" dur="2.337">It&amp;#39;s got this orange silicon
band that comes in the box</text><text start="57.327" dur="1.863">and it feels surprisingly similar</text><text start="59.19" dur="1.26">to any other smartwatch band.</text><text start="60.45" dur="3">And then it&amp;#39;s got a
1.96-inch diagonal display.</text><text start="63.45" dur="2.49">The color is metallic gray,</text><text start="65.94" dur="3.9">but the material here is
definitely not nearly as metallic.</text><text start="69.84" dur="2.19">It does say aluminum alloy on their site,</text><text start="72.03" dur="1.98">but if you didn&amp;#39;t tell
me that, just holding it,</text><text start="74.01" dur="2.85">I would swear this is 100%
made of plastic on the outside.</text><text start="76.86" dur="1.29">But, you know, at least it&amp;#39;s coated</text><text start="78.15" dur="2.1">in sort of a matte finish on the back part</text><text start="80.25" dur="2.28">that&amp;#39;s touching your wrist
around the heart rate sensors.</text><text start="82.53" dur="2.43">And then there&amp;#39;s some
engravings with a bunch of text</text><text start="84.96" dur="2.28">in the Nothing font, like the model number</text><text start="87.24" dur="1.26">and the headquarters location,</text><text start="88.5" dur="2.52">which happens to be Cheapside, London,</text><text start="91.02" dur="2.04">which is very appropriate.</text><text start="93.06" dur="2.4">Honestly, it doesn&amp;#39;t
look or feel terrible,</text><text start="95.46" dur="2.67">but it just, it clearly has
all the obvious shortcuts</text><text start="98.13" dur="2.64">of a cheap product the more
you look closely at it.</text><text start="100.77" dur="1.44">You know, the bezels are thick</text><text start="102.21" dur="2.64">and also weirdly uneven
all the way around.</text><text start="104.85" dur="2.91">There is no rotating dial,
just the single shallow,</text><text start="107.76" dur="2.82">cheap feeling button right
above the small tinny speaker</text><text start="110.58" dur="3.42">to the side and no fancy
puck to charge, just USBA</text><text start="114" dur="2.34">to dual pin cable that comes in the box.</text><text start="116.34" dur="1.86">It magnetizes to the
back, which in hindsight,</text><text start="118.2" dur="2.4">I guess is just as
convenient as a fancy puck,</text><text start="120.6" dur="1.95">but, you know, a little
less elegant looking.</text><text start="122.55" dur="3.36">But I guess, the key here is
all of it works and it&amp;#39;s solid.</text><text start="125.91" dur="3.63">Like, the brightness outside,
it gets up to 600 nits.</text><text start="129.54" dur="1.2">There&amp;#39;s no auto brightness though,</text><text start="130.74" dur="2.79">so you gotta change brightness
manually, like this.</text><text start="133.53" dur="3.12">But hey, at its max, it&amp;#39;s
very good indoors, at least.</text><text start="136.65" dur="2.85">And the whole thing is IP68
water and dust resistant,</text><text start="139.5" dur="2.61">which is, first of all,
great if you want to go out</text><text start="142.11" dur="2.13">and sweat in it or go out in the rain.</text><text start="144.24" dur="2.37">But also wasn&amp;#39;t there
a long period of time</text><text start="146.61" dur="3.12">where OnePlus and Nothing
products didn&amp;#39;t get IP certified</text><text start="149.73" dur="1.8">&amp;#39;cause it cost too much extra?</text><text start="151.53" dur="2.04">But now, the CMF watch has it,</text><text start="153.57" dur="2.05">but then it all works with the
CMF Watch app on your phone,</text><text start="155.62" dur="2.84">which is where all the data
gets sent via Bluetooth.</text><text start="158.46" dur="2.76">So honestly, there&amp;#39;s not too
many different clever ways</text><text start="161.22" dur="1.92">to design a watch UI,</text><text start="163.14" dur="1.68">so, you know, if you get a smart watch,</text><text start="164.82" dur="1.44">if you&amp;#39;ve used one before,</text><text start="166.26" dur="1.92">you&amp;#39;ll basically already
know how to use this one.</text><text start="168.18" dur="1.62">So your watch face is your starting point.</text><text start="169.8" dur="2.49">And then you can swipe
through fitness data,</text><text start="172.29" dur="2.94">which looks surprisingly
like Apple Watch rings.</text><text start="175.23" dur="2.31">It&amp;#39;s got your heart rate
history for the past 24 hours.</text><text start="177.54" dur="2.73">The weather is there in
that simple dot matrix way,</text><text start="180.27" dur="2.04">plus sleep time if you
use it to track sleep,</text><text start="182.31" dur="2.58">then a single press on
that plastic feeling button</text><text start="184.89" dur="1.38">will take you to your app list,</text><text start="186.27" dur="2.43">which you can view as a grid or as a list.</text><text start="188.7" dur="1.23">And then there&amp;#39;s a good
amount of apps in here</text><text start="189.93" dur="1.47">that just come on the watch.</text><text start="191.4" dur="2.91">So an exercise app that has
a ton of different exercises,</text><text start="194.31" dur="1.38">the blood oxygen app,</text><text start="195.69" dur="1.86">which gives you your
measurements whenever you want.</text><text start="197.55" dur="1.62">You&amp;#39;ve also got a phone call app</text><text start="199.17" dur="2.34">and yes, you can receive
phone calls on the watch</text><text start="201.51" dur="2.64">and that tinny little
speaker will crank out audio</text><text start="204.15" dur="2.73">as loud as it can to
facilitate a real conversation.</text><text start="206.88" dur="1.38">There&amp;#39;s also a music app,</text><text start="208.26" dur="1.38">which gives you just music controls</text><text start="209.64" dur="2.04">for whenever something
is playing on your phone.</text><text start="211.68" dur="2.19">There&amp;#39;s even a camera remote app,</text><text start="213.87" dur="3.27">which it doesn&amp;#39;t actually open
the camera app on my phone</text><text start="217.14" dur="1.53">or show a viewfinder preview,</text><text start="218.67" dur="1.83">but when I do have the camera app open,</text><text start="220.5" dur="2.61">the shutter button does
actually work, so there&amp;#39;s that.</text><text start="223.11" dur="1.71">There&amp;#39;s even a voice assistant app,</text><text start="224.82" dur="2.16">which if you open it, basically
just opens Google Assistant</text><text start="226.98" dur="1.29">on your phone and then uses the mics</text><text start="228.27" dur="1.977">and speakers on the watch
for you to interact with it.</text><text start="230.247" dur="2.523">The Find My Phone app is hilarious though.</text><text start="232.77" dur="3.72">It only works when the CMF app is open</text><text start="236.49" dur="1.23">or running on the phone.</text><text start="237.72" dur="1.5">So if you&amp;#39;ve just closed the app,</text><text start="239.22" dur="2.34">it will just ask you to
open the app on your phone,</text><text start="241.56" dur="1.44">but you don&amp;#39;t have your phone.</text><text start="243" dur="1.5">But when you do actually open it,</text><text start="244.5" dur="3.123">so it plays this max volume ringing sound,</text><text start="248.61" dur="1.71">which will allow you to find the phone,</text><text start="250.32" dur="3.06">which is pretty cool as long
as you&amp;#39;ve got that app open</text><text start="253.38" dur="1.38">or have opened it recently.</text><text start="254.76" dur="2.31">And I will say the UI on the watch itself,</text><text start="257.07" dur="2.01">it feels like it&amp;#39;s moving
around pretty quickly</text><text start="259.08" dur="2.73">and not too much waiting
time to actually open</text><text start="261.81" dur="1.47">or switch between these apps,</text><text start="263.28" dur="1.5">mostly because they&amp;#39;re very lightweight.</text><text start="264.78" dur="2.64">Like, this thing is basically
just a Bluetooth accessory,</text><text start="267.42" dur="1.86">pinging little controls on your phone</text><text start="269.28" dur="1.44">and then it&amp;#39;s got watch faces</text><text start="270.72" dur="1.86">and the watch faces have
a nice little variety.</text><text start="272.58" dur="1.53">I think this one&amp;#39;s probably my favorite</text><text start="274.11" dur="1.05">with the orange theme</text><text start="275.16" dur="3.36">and a second hand moving slowly
in a full circle down here.</text><text start="278.52" dur="1.56">I feel like I&amp;#39;m pretty impressed.</text><text start="280.08" dur="1.47">It&amp;#39;s also very lightweight,</text><text start="281.55" dur="4.05">not that people always value
lightweight in watches,</text><text start="285.6" dur="1.53">but in this price range,</text><text start="287.13" dur="1.47">they&amp;#39;re pretty much all
gonna be made of plastic.</text><text start="288.6" dur="1.11">So you might as well lean into it.</text><text start="289.71" dur="2.91">And this thing is super light,
so if you&amp;#39;re doing sports</text><text start="292.62" dur="3.09">or just running around, yeah,
it&amp;#39;s kind of out of the way.</text><text start="295.71" dur="2.58">And then because it&amp;#39;s
a Bluetooth accessory</text><text start="298.29" dur="2.49">and a pretty generic one,
you can use this actually</text><text start="300.78" dur="1.53">with basically any Android phone.</text><text start="302.31" dur="4.29">So you just grab the Play
Store app, which has 3.1 stars</text><text start="306.6" dur="2.64">and it does have some connection
issues occasionally for me.</text><text start="309.24" dur="2.04">But even that sort of
availability, at least,</text><text start="311.28" dur="2.55">on any Android phone is
better than Apple can say</text><text start="313.83" dur="0.99">about their own smartwatch.</text><text start="314.82" dur="2.22">And it gives me all the
basic info I&amp;#39;m looking for</text><text start="317.04" dur="3.51">from heart rate history
to workout summaries.</text><text start="320.55" dur="1.95">Honestly, it&amp;#39;s not so
bad when it&amp;#39;s working.</text><text start="322.5" dur="2.22">So I&amp;#39;m also able to do sleep tracking,</text><text start="324.72" dur="2.4">since that only really requires
the heart rate sensors.</text><text start="327.12" dur="2.82">But I also continue to get
that info from the sensors</text><text start="329.94" dur="2.01">that are actually built into
the mattress cover I use.</text><text start="331.95" dur="1.83">At this point, I&amp;#39;m sure
you&amp;#39;ve heard of Eight Sleep</text><text start="333.78" dur="2.34">and the Pod Mattress Cover
that, you know, warms up</text><text start="336.12" dur="2.37">and cools down each side
of the bed independently,</text><text start="338.49" dur="0.84">automatically.</text><text start="339.33" dur="2.16">So that thing not only
helps you sleep better</text><text start="341.49" dur="1.41">by automatically changing
the temperatures,</text><text start="342.9" dur="1.68">but then it also monitors how you sleep.</text><text start="344.58" dur="1.11">It&amp;#39;s got the sensors inside</text><text start="345.69" dur="1.35">and then delivers a report for you.</text><text start="347.04" dur="1.32">So you just open the app every morning,</text><text start="348.36" dur="1.26">you get this personalized report</text><text start="349.62" dur="2.28">that shows you things like
your heart rate variance,</text><text start="351.9" dur="1.26">respiratory rate, you know,</text><text start="353.16" dur="1.98">how your sleep stages
panned out overnight.</text><text start="355.14" dur="3.12">So I think I&amp;#39;m officially
done wearing any wearables</text><text start="358.26" dur="2.31">to sleep for any sleep tracking data,</text><text start="360.57" dur="1.17">just &amp;#39;cause this handles it all.</text><text start="361.74" dur="1.2">Now, I&amp;#39;ve actually
talked about them before</text><text start="362.94" dur="1.98">and I saw a lot of your
comments about Eight Sleep.</text><text start="364.92" dur="2.55">And so I chatted with
Eight Sleep about them</text><text start="367.47" dur="1.35">and was able to get them to offer</text><text start="368.82" dur="2.49">a little bit more functionality
to people who are new,</text><text start="371.31" dur="1.62">like, first time signing up.</text><text start="372.93" dur="1.35">So they&amp;#39;ll actually now,</text><text start="374.28" dur="1.77">no matter what your membership level,</text><text start="376.05" dur="3.6">they will give you a free
Sleep Report every six months,</text><text start="379.65" dur="1.65">so it&amp;#39;s not behind any sort of paywall.</text><text start="381.3" dur="1.77">So thanks to Eight Sleep
for sponsoring this video.</text><text start="383.07" dur="1.86">I&amp;#39;m happy to report that
they&amp;#39;re also offering</text><text start="384.93" dur="2.94">you guys the largest
discount that they ever have.</text><text start="387.87" dur="0.99">So if you wanna check it out,</text><text start="388.86" dur="1.92">feel free to check out the
link in the description</text><text start="390.78" dur="1.56">and use code MKBHD.</text><text start="392.34" dur="1.98">So now that I&amp;#39;m not wearing it to sleep,</text><text start="394.32" dur="2.73">I am able to charge the
CMF Watch every night.</text><text start="397.05" dur="2.58">Like I said, it&amp;#39;s got this
little magnetic pin charger,</text><text start="399.63" dur="1.56">technically not as pretty</text><text start="401.19" dur="2.01">as those fancy wireless charging pucks,</text><text start="403.2" dur="1.41">but honestly, pretty close.</text><text start="404.61" dur="3.99">And the battery life, I&amp;#39;ve
realized, is really, really good</text><text start="408.6" dur="1.2">because of how simple it is.</text><text start="409.8" dur="2.34">Again, just a Bluetooth accessory,</text><text start="412.14" dur="2.16">not a whole ton of
processing power needed.</text><text start="414.3" dur="1.8">On their site, they&amp;#39;re claiming, like,</text><text start="416.1" dur="1.65">13 days of regular use.</text><text start="417.75" dur="1.53">I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m gonna get that,</text><text start="419.28" dur="3.3">but I was able to get three
straight days easy, no problem.</text><text start="422.58" dur="2.4">And I&amp;#39;m sure you could
probably use Power Saver mode</text><text start="424.98" dur="1.47">and get even more if you wanted to.</text><text start="426.45" dur="3.3">So it&amp;#39;s got better battery
life than an Apple Watch.</text><text start="429.75" dur="1.44">But really, the main thing that I learned,</text><text start="431.19" dur="2.34">when testing this watch, is it turns out,</text><text start="433.53" dur="4.897">this is actually a pretty
expensive watch in its segment.</text><text start="438.427" dur="5">$69 is on the premium end
for a very basic smartwatch.</text><text start="444.543" dur="2.127">It&amp;#39;s actually pretty
common for the cheapest,</text><text start="446.67" dur="4.26">most basic smartwatches to
be in the 20 to $50 range.</text><text start="450.93" dur="0.87">And, you know, at that point,</text><text start="451.8" dur="2.16">they&amp;#39;re all, more or
less, the same product.</text><text start="453.96" dur="2.91">They&amp;#39;re all a simple,
plastic-y Bluetooth accessory</text><text start="456.87" dur="1.83">with some slightly different designs.</text><text start="458.7" dur="5">So this, the CMF Watch Pro is
a slightly better packaged,</text><text start="464.49" dur="2.7">slightly better design,
slightly better looking version</text><text start="467.19" dur="3.36">for a slightly upcharge,
kind of the same way Nothing</text><text start="470.55" dur="1.71">is probably charging a little bit more</text><text start="472.26" dur="2.49">than you would expect for a
phone with the same specs,</text><text start="474.75" dur="0.87">just &amp;#39;cause of the design</text><text start="475.62" dur="0.99">and the nice stuff they do with it.</text><text start="476.61" dur="1.74">That&amp;#39;s what this is too.</text><text start="478.35" dur="1.53">And I bring up Nothing because CMF</text><text start="479.88" dur="3.06">is Nothing&amp;#39;s ultra-budget sub-brand</text><text start="482.94" dur="2.55">and they actually do some
other stuff, like earphones,</text><text start="485.49" dur="2.97">chargers, same deal,
extremely cheap products,</text><text start="488.46" dur="1.65">but just marked up a little bit</text><text start="490.11" dur="1.86">for nice packaging and nice design.</text><text start="491.97" dur="1.86">So here, I&amp;#39;ll leave you with this.</text><text start="493.83" dur="3.9">CMF, in the industries,
typically stands for color,</text><text start="497.73" dur="1.23">material, finish.</text><text start="498.96" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s the name of the company,</text><text start="499.793" dur="2.797">but it&amp;#39;s also what
those letters stand for.</text><text start="502.59" dur="3.45">And the CMF of this smartwatch</text><text start="506.04" dur="4.62">is it&amp;#39;s very much still
silver-ish, fingerprint-y,</text><text start="510.66" dur="2.88">technically metal, but
feels kind of plastic-y.</text><text start="513.54" dur="2.19">But if you squint enough,</text><text start="515.73" dur="4.05">this square kind of looks
like an Apple Watch Ultra.</text><text start="519.78" dur="2.07">And if that&amp;#39;s your comparison point,</text><text start="521.85" dur="2.61">then this thing is a total bargain.</text><text start="524.46" dur="2.88">So I think that was what
their real goal was.</text><text start="527.34" dur="2.1">Yeah, if you wanna get one
of these things, you can.</text><text start="529.44" dur="2.88">It is maybe a little more
challenging to get it in the U.S.</text><text start="532.32" dur="2.49">Maybe if you import it,
spend a couple extra dollars,</text><text start="534.81" dur="2.16">then you&amp;#39;re competing with
some other smartwatches,</text><text start="536.97" dur="1.083">but it&amp;#39;s an option.</text><text start="538.89" dur="1.95">But now you know it exists.</text><text start="540.84" dur="1.44">The more you know.</text><text start="542.28" dur="2.933">Thanks for watching, catch you
guys in the next one, peace.</text><text start="546.101" dur="3">(soft upbeat music)</text></transcript>
