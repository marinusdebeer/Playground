<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.108" dur="2.526">(bright music)</text><text start="2.634" dur="2.496">- Okay, so Apple had a nice
short little 30 minute event</text><text start="5.13" dur="2.76">today announcing just a
bunch of new iPad stuff.</text><text start="7.89" dur="1.904">Now, this was the
longest they&amp;#39;ve ever gone</text><text start="9.794" dur="2.896">without updating anything iPad related,</text><text start="12.69" dur="1.29">so they had some cooking to do.</text><text start="13.98" dur="0.833">But the thing is,</text><text start="14.813" dur="1.987">and I feel like we&amp;#39;ve been
saying this for years,</text><text start="16.8" dur="5">it kind of doesn&amp;#39;t matter how
powerful they make the iPad.</text><text start="22.38" dur="2.79">It&amp;#39;s still an iPad,
right? It&amp;#39;s still iPadOS.</text><text start="25.17" dur="3.702">And we&amp;#39;ve seen gigantic
improvements in the M-series chips</text><text start="28.872" dur="1.158">and these iPads are like</text><text start="30.03" dur="2.22">the most powerful chips ever on paper,</text><text start="32.25" dur="2.16">but they&amp;#39;re still iPads.</text><text start="34.41" dur="3.06">So the last thing we
need after all this time</text><text start="37.47" dur="4.983">is just another spec-bumped iPad, right?</text><text start="43.29" dur="3.36">Well, let me introduce
you to the newest iPads.</text><text start="46.65" dur="2.16">So first up, there&amp;#39;s a new iPad Air</text><text start="48.81" dur="2.46">which follows the script of
bringing a few things down</text><text start="51.27" dur="1.74">from the previous iPad Pros,</text><text start="53.01" dur="1.35">and, of course, you
know, making it available</text><text start="54.36" dur="0.96">for this lower price.</text><text start="55.32" dur="3.54">So it graduates from the
M1 to the M2 chip inside,</text><text start="58.86" dur="3.15">it starts up at 128 gigs of storage now,</text><text start="62.01" dur="2.023">and it moves the webcam
to the landscape bezel</text><text start="64.033" dur="1.517">where it belongs.</text><text start="65.55" dur="1.41">It gets faster wifi,</text><text start="66.96" dur="1.95">and for the first time
there is a larger one now,</text><text start="68.91" dur="4.77">so they&amp;#39;re calling it the
11-inch and the 13-inch iPad Air.</text><text start="73.68" dur="1.47">I had to clarify it just because</text><text start="75.15" dur="1.844">the last one was 10.9 inches;</text><text start="76.994" dur="2.225">so are they just simplifying the name,</text><text start="79.219" dur="1.541">like is it actually bigger?</text><text start="80.76" dur="1.71">And turns out, yeah, there is just</text><text start="82.47" dur="1.41">a little bit more screen here.</text><text start="83.88" dur="3.45">Great. But other than that,
it&amp;#39;s pretty predictable.</text><text start="87.33" dur="2.43">It&amp;#39;s a spec bump. Like this is
sticking to the script here.</text><text start="89.76" dur="2.49">I think I could hand you
the newest iPad right now</text><text start="92.25" dur="1.32">and you couldn&amp;#39;t really tell</text><text start="93.57" dur="1.989">the new Air from the old
Air just looking at it</text><text start="95.559" dur="1.821">other than if you&amp;#39;re
holding the bigger one,</text><text start="97.38" dur="2.94">or if you recognized the
super exciting new colors.</text><text start="100.32" dur="1.88">I mean, hopefully you
could hear my sarcasm</text><text start="102.2" dur="1.939">through the screen, but
there&amp;#39;s Blue, Purple,</text><text start="104.139" dur="2.121">Starlight, and Space Gray.</text><text start="106.26" dur="3.93">So it&amp;#39;s 599 for the small one
and 799 for the bigger one.</text><text start="110.19" dur="2.28">But then, we also got a
more significant update</text><text start="112.47" dur="1.59">to the iPad Pros.</text><text start="114.06" dur="1.405">This is where they push
the limits of the iPad.</text><text start="115.465" dur="2.492">This is where they wanna show
their absolute best stuff</text><text start="117.957" dur="2.103">and the best possible tablets.</text><text start="120.06" dur="4.353">And, man, if we just ignore
the software for a second,</text><text start="125.4" dur="1.56">these new iPads are ridiculous.</text><text start="126.96" dur="1.68">So first of all, they
start off by revealing</text><text start="128.64" dur="3.12">that these new iPads, the
11-inch and the 13-inch,</text><text start="131.76" dur="4.68">are the new thinnest Apple
devices ever made, ever.</text><text start="136.44" dur="1.38">That&amp;#39;s including phones,</text><text start="137.82" dur="2.52">that&amp;#39;s including like
old iPods and everything.</text><text start="140.34" dur="3.09">The 11-inch is 5.3 millimeters thin,</text><text start="143.43" dur="3.57">and the 13-inch is 5.1 millimeters thin;</text><text start="147" dur="3.81">so that&amp;#39;s literally thinner
than the iPod Nano ever was.</text><text start="150.81" dur="1.654">It&amp;#39;s nuts. It just looks ridiculous.</text><text start="152.464" dur="2.396">It&amp;#39;s crazy to hold.</text><text start="154.86" dur="2.25">It&amp;#39;s also lighter, as you might imagine.</text><text start="157.11" dur="0.9">It just kind of feels like this</text><text start="158.01" dur="2.55">impossible sheet of metal in your hand.</text><text start="160.56" dur="1.8">I don&amp;#39;t know if anyone
ever looked at an iPad Pro</text><text start="162.36" dur="1.77">and asked for it to be thinner,</text><text start="164.13" dur="2.103">but that&amp;#39;s what they went and did.</text><text start="167.821" dur="2.399">What could possibly go wrong?</text><text start="170.22" dur="3.72">Fun fact, this also now
means that the iPad Air</text><text start="173.94" dur="2.49">is heavier than the iPad Pro</text><text start="176.43" dur="3.63">just to make sure we keep a
mess of an iPad lineup going.</text><text start="180.06" dur="3.06">The new Pro also gets a
new chip and a new screen.</text><text start="183.12" dur="1.86">So Apple took this event to introduce us</text><text start="184.98" dur="1.89">to the next generation of Apple silicon</text><text start="186.87" dur="2.04">with the M4 chip,</text><text start="188.91" dur="2.49">and this iPad is the only
thing that it&amp;#39;s in right now.</text><text start="191.4" dur="1.53">It&amp;#39;s just the iPad with M4.</text><text start="192.93" dur="2.91">So that gives it, stop
me if it sounds familiar,</text><text start="195.84" dur="2.07">even more ridiculous amounts of power</text><text start="197.91" dur="2.76">in such a tiny physical
and thermal envelope,</text><text start="200.67" dur="1.8">especially since we came from M2.</text><text start="202.47" dur="2.31">So it&amp;#39;s a more power
efficient 3 nanometer chip.</text><text start="204.78" dur="3.99">The CPU core is net out to
like 50% faster than M2.</text><text start="208.77" dur="3">The GPU is up to four times faster.</text><text start="211.77" dur="1.23">And they&amp;#39;re saying that they can do</text><text start="213" dur="3.3">the same performance output
as M2 with half the power,</text><text start="216.3" dur="1.14">so it&amp;#39;s super efficient.</text><text start="217.44" dur="2.91">There&amp;#39;s an improved neural
engine. There&amp;#39;s better cooling.</text><text start="220.35" dur="4.11">Now, again, I don&amp;#39;t know who
was asking for a thinner iPad,</text><text start="224.46" dur="1.98">but there&amp;#39;s kind of no denying</text><text start="226.44" dur="2.85">that it&amp;#39;s at least just
physically impressive to look at.</text><text start="229.29" dur="2.01">And this is the type of
thing, this is the form factor</text><text start="231.3" dur="4.02">that is specifically
enabled by the M4 chip.</text><text start="235.32" dur="2.4">Apple is quoting</text><text start="237.72" dur="2.82">basically the same battery
life as the last iPad Pro,</text><text start="240.54" dur="1.579">and I have to assume that there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="242.119" dur="2.112">significantly less physical
battery in the thing</text><text start="244.231" dur="1.469">&amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s so much thinner.</text><text start="245.7" dur="1.267">So that just basically
means Apple&amp;#39;s going,</text><text start="246.967" dur="2.81">&amp;quot;Hey, we think that that
was enough battery life</text><text start="249.777" dur="2.65">&amp;quot;in the last gen, so we&amp;#39;re
just gonna match that</text><text start="252.427" dur="2.633">&amp;quot;and that means we can go
way thinner with less battery</text><text start="255.06" dur="1.95">because the new chip is more efficient.&amp;quot;</text><text start="257.01" dur="2.82">So then, the new display,
this is another thing</text><text start="259.83" dur="2.37">that is actually kind of
enabled also by the M4 chip.</text><text start="262.2" dur="1.74">Sometimes it seems like
they&amp;#39;re just saying that,</text><text start="263.94" dur="1.05">but this is also true.</text><text start="264.99" dur="2.13">So these are OLED iPads now.</text><text start="267.12" dur="2.01">Both sizes, it&amp;#39;s the
exact same set of features</text><text start="269.13" dur="2.01">across both iPads, which kind of makes</text><text start="271.14" dur="1.705">the $300 price difference between them</text><text start="272.845" dur="1.925">a little bit tougher.</text><text start="274.77" dur="2.88">But yeah, OLEDs on both the new iPad Pros.</text><text start="277.65" dur="1.35">And OLED is awesome, right?</text><text start="279" dur="2.97">We already knew this. We&amp;#39;ve
had OLED phones forever.</text><text start="281.97" dur="3.36">The pitch black blacks, the
individually lit pixels,</text><text start="285.33" dur="1.318">the super awesome vibrance.</text><text start="286.648" dur="1.892">All of the OLED stuff is great,</text><text start="288.54" dur="1.47">and we were excited to finally see it</text><text start="290.01" dur="2.97">in a relatively gigantic
display that is an iPad.</text><text start="292.98" dur="3.69">But making a huge OLED
that&amp;#39;s also incredibly bright</text><text start="296.67" dur="1.921">was a challenge that
required just a little bit</text><text start="298.591" dur="2.939">of extra engineering, a
little extra ingenuity.</text><text start="301.53" dur="1.74">So they put together
something that they&amp;#39;re calling</text><text start="303.27" dur="3.03">a tandem OLED display,
which honestly to me,</text><text start="306.3" dur="2.73">I think this is maybe
the most interesting part</text><text start="309.03" dur="2.73">of the whole tablet event today.</text><text start="311.76" dur="1.41">So you can basically think of it as</text><text start="313.17" dur="3.36">two different OLED displays
stacked on top of each other,</text><text start="316.53" dur="2.04">and then the new display driver on M4</text><text start="318.57" dur="3.73">can address both layers simultaneously.</text><text start="322.3" dur="2.18">So that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s allowing them to get</text><text start="324.48" dur="2.88">really high local brightness,
and that&amp;#39;s the spec now.</text><text start="327.36" dur="2.55">That&amp;#39;s 1000 nits of peak
full screen brightness</text><text start="329.91" dur="4.05">and 1600 nits of peak HDR brightness</text><text start="333.96" dur="2.37">on an OLED on an iPad sized screen.</text><text start="336.33" dur="2.43">And in person, it looks,</text><text start="338.76" dur="2.82">well, it looks like a really bright OLED.</text><text start="341.58" dur="3.227">It looks super colorful,
really bright, inky blacks.</text><text start="344.807" dur="2.803">In this hands-on area I got
to spend like 30 minutes in,</text><text start="347.61" dur="1.2">it&amp;#39;s not gonna look its best</text><text start="348.81" dur="1.47">and there was crazy lighting everywhere;</text><text start="350.28" dur="1.92">but I will be getting
my hands on it to review</text><text start="352.2" dur="1.77">and I intend to dive in and find out</text><text start="353.97" dur="2.16">if there are any downsides,
but it looks pretty great here.</text><text start="356.13" dur="1.89">And then, also weirdly, they announced</text><text start="358.02" dur="3.69">a Nano texture matte
version of the iPad Pro;</text><text start="361.71" dur="3.36">so now there&amp;#39;s a matte Pro display XDR.</text><text start="365.07" dur="2.735">I would be very careful about ordering</text><text start="367.805" dur="2.702">this particular option,
based on what I&amp;#39;ve seen.</text><text start="370.507" dur="2.363">I can see here that it
is definitely better</text><text start="372.87" dur="2.16">at dealing with reflections
than a normal display.</text><text start="375.03" dur="1.17">That&amp;#39;s awesome.</text><text start="376.2" dur="2.641">But just like a desktop
version, that is at the expense</text><text start="378.841" dur="3.449">of a little bit of sharpness and contrast.</text><text start="382.29" dur="2.58">You know, the blacks don&amp;#39;t
look nearly as black to me</text><text start="384.87" dur="2.04">even at zero degrees off axis.</text><text start="386.91" dur="1.92">And I also have to wonder about durability</text><text start="388.83" dur="2.788">because the Pro display XDR is very picky</text><text start="391.618" dur="2.102">about which microfiber cloth you use,</text><text start="393.72" dur="2.13">and you can literally ruin
it if you use the wrong one.</text><text start="395.85" dur="2.511">And with this iPad, you know,
I can feel the difference</text><text start="398.361" dur="2.859">between the soft touch
texture of the Nano texture</text><text start="401.22" dur="1.795">and the glossy bezels,
and I just have a feeling</text><text start="403.015" dur="3.155">that you&amp;#39;re only gonna
be able to use or rely on</text><text start="406.17" dur="2.07">the microfiber that comes
in the box with this thing.</text><text start="408.24" dur="1.89">And not only does it cost an extra $100</text><text start="410.13" dur="0.93">to get the Nano texture;</text><text start="411.06" dur="2.832">it&amp;#39;s also only available on the 1 terabyte</text><text start="413.892" dur="3.138">and 2 terabyte highest end models.</text><text start="417.03" dur="1.62">So I think they know that people</text><text start="418.65" dur="1.8">shouldn&amp;#39;t just walk in
the store and just get it</text><text start="420.45" dur="1.2">&amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s on the base one.</text><text start="421.65" dur="1.59">So yeah, just be careful with that one.</text><text start="423.24" dur="2.01">But you know what probably
made the most headlines</text><text start="425.25" dur="1.41">out of all the stuff announced today</text><text start="426.66" dur="2.76">is a spec-bumped Apple Pencil.</text><text start="429.42" dur="3.15">There&amp;#39;s now a new Apple Pencil Pro,</text><text start="432.57" dur="3.36">and it looks exactly the same
as the previous Apple Pencil</text><text start="435.93" dur="2.01">but with this new text on the back</text><text start="437.94" dur="2.34">that says Pencil Pro on it now.</text><text start="440.28" dur="2.146">Unfortunately, that&amp;#39;s
still not the eraser.</text><text start="442.426" dur="1.874">But yeah, this new Apple Pencil Pro</text><text start="444.3" dur="3.45">has a haptic motor inside,
so it supports Find My now.</text><text start="447.75" dur="2.43">There&amp;#39;s also a new squeeze
sensor in the barrel for</text><text start="450.18" dur="2.97">activating tools in different
apps that will support it,</text><text start="453.15" dur="4.32">and a new gyroscope actually
makes it rotation sensitive.</text><text start="457.47" dur="2.91">And I was trying this,
it&amp;#39;s surprisingly precise,</text><text start="460.38" dur="1.2">like really, really good.</text><text start="461.58" dur="2.22">So if you&amp;#39;re an artist, not like me,</text><text start="463.8" dur="1.738">you know, maybe you&amp;#39;re doing a barrel roll</text><text start="465.538" dur="3.692">with certain drawing apps
or calligraphy applications</text><text start="469.23" dur="3.63">for the $129 that it costs
to get one of these things.</text><text start="472.86" dur="1.62">But another incredibly inconvenient note,</text><text start="474.48" dur="2.82">this new Pro Pencil is only compatible</text><text start="477.3" dur="4.71">with the newest recently
announced iPad Pro or iPad Air.</text><text start="482.01" dur="4.74">Because when they moved that
webcam to the long side,</text><text start="486.75" dur="2.009">that&amp;#39;s also where a lot of
the magnets for lining up</text><text start="488.759" dur="1.441">and charging a pencil were.</text><text start="490.2" dur="1.95">So they had to redesign
the magnets up there</text><text start="492.15" dur="1.56">and that&amp;#39;s now a different array,</text><text start="493.71" dur="3">so it&amp;#39;s only compatible
with the newest iPads.</text><text start="496.71" dur="1.5">Why didn&amp;#39;t they just move it</text><text start="498.21" dur="2.91">to the other side for charging?</text><text start="501.12" dur="2.76">I don&amp;#39;t know. Maybe that
makes too much sense.</text><text start="503.88" dur="2.04">There&amp;#39;s also a new magic keyboard as well.</text><text start="505.92" dur="2.97">Still ungodly expensive,
but if you get the new one,</text><text start="508.89" dur="2.22">it&amp;#39;s also, it&amp;#39;s lighter
than the previous gen,</text><text start="511.11" dur="1.14">the track pad is bigger,</text><text start="512.25" dur="1.77">and there&amp;#39;s a whole
function row at the top now,</text><text start="514.02" dur="2.22">which actually that is super useful.</text><text start="516.24" dur="1.98">And the pass through
charging is even faster;</text><text start="518.22" dur="2.73">apparently it&amp;#39;s 60 watts
through the pins in the back.</text><text start="520.95" dur="2.43">But all that being said, at
the end of the day, guess what?</text><text start="523.38" dur="3.54">We just got another set
of spec-bumped iPads.</text><text start="526.92" dur="3.299">They are metal rectangles
with incredible power</text><text start="530.219" dur="4.651">and efficiency in our hands
that are just still iPads.</text><text start="534.87" dur="2.34">And I don&amp;#39;t know how many
more times I can say this,</text><text start="537.21" dur="2.304">but like taking advantage
of all of this power</text><text start="539.514" dur="1.596">is nearly impossible.</text><text start="541.11" dur="2.533">There are a tiny sliver of
apps that actually make it</text><text start="543.643" dur="2.237">feel like worth upgrading.</text><text start="545.88" dur="2.04">There&amp;#39;s almost nothing these iPads can do</text><text start="547.92" dur="2.97">that my M1 iPad Pro can&amp;#39;t do.</text><text start="550.89" dur="1.62">And this isn&amp;#39;t even to
downplay the hardware</text><text start="552.51" dur="1.78">&amp;#39;cause the hardware is actually amazing.</text><text start="554.29" dur="2.3">That&amp;#39;s where the difference comes from.</text><text start="556.59" dur="3.435">It&amp;#39;s got this super bright
high resolution OLED display</text><text start="560.025" dur="1.785">with pitch black blacks,</text><text start="561.81" dur="2.55">this M4 chip with ridiculous power,</text><text start="564.36" dur="4.74">and efficiency, new CPU, new,
GPU better neural engine.</text><text start="569.1" dur="1.83">I&amp;#39;ve never wanted an iPad to be thinner,</text><text start="570.93" dur="2.4">but that line about them wanting the iPad</text><text start="573.33" dur="2.55">to feel like a magic sheet of glass</text><text start="575.88" dur="2.82">really resonated with
this model in particular,</text><text start="578.7" dur="1.668">even if you do feel like
you could snap it in half</text><text start="580.368" dur="0.912">the whole time.</text><text start="581.28" dur="2.16">It&amp;#39;s just the awkwardness of this one</text><text start="583.44" dur="2.4">mainly comes from timing
&amp;#39;cause I think we all know,</text><text start="585.84" dur="1.65">well, it&amp;#39;s already been announced.</text><text start="587.49" dur="2.79">WWDC, their Worldwide
Developers Conference,</text><text start="590.28" dur="1.89">is right around the
corner, and we all know</text><text start="592.17" dur="2.01">and expect them to update
all of the software</text><text start="594.18" dur="1.2">across all their stuff:</text><text start="595.38" dur="4.53">a new iOS, a new iPadOS,
so I guess iPadOS 18.</text><text start="599.91" dur="3.69">And whatever Apple is gonna
decide to do with that</text><text start="603.6" dur="0.9">is around the corner.</text><text start="604.5" dur="2.91">So we&amp;#39;ve got these new
iPads shipping next week,</text><text start="607.41" dur="2.67">but all the new software,
that could be awesome.</text><text start="610.08" dur="0.9">Well, that&amp;#39;s this summer.</text><text start="610.98" dur="1.648">And this feels like it could
be one of the biggest updates</text><text start="612.628" dur="1.502">yet to these iPads.</text><text start="614.13" dur="1.53">You know, it&amp;#39;s Apple showing their hand</text><text start="615.66" dur="2.31">at how many more AI
features they wanna build in</text><text start="617.97" dur="1.53">and how many more
features people wanna add</text><text start="619.5" dur="2.22">that lets this be their primary computer,</text><text start="621.72" dur="2.46">maybe more Siri improvements,
all of this stuff.</text><text start="624.18" dur="2.01">So in this awkward meantime, here we have</text><text start="626.19" dur="3.57">these really, really impressive
spec-bumped iPad Pros,</text><text start="629.76" dur="2.01">the most powerful iPads of all time,</text><text start="631.77" dur="2.49">the thinnest Apple devices
literally ever made;</text><text start="634.26" dur="1.89">but the list of things
it can do is the same</text><text start="636.15" dur="1.95">as my three-year-old M1, just saying.</text><text start="638.1" dur="1.23">What a time to be alive.</text><text start="639.33" dur="1.56">Speaking of announcements, though,</text><text start="640.89" dur="2.73">Ridge and I have finally launched</text><text start="643.62" dur="0.96">our first product together.</text><text start="644.58" dur="1.71">So it starts with the Ridge Wallet,</text><text start="646.29" dur="2.82">you know, the minimal high
quality industrial wallet,</text><text start="649.11" dur="2.64">the more modern way to
carry cash and cards.</text><text start="651.75" dur="1.44">Well, you might know I joined Ridge</text><text start="653.19" dur="2.22">as the chief creative
partner earlier this year</text><text start="655.41" dur="3.45">and we&amp;#39;re finally releasing
our first MKBHD gear together.</text><text start="658.86" dur="1.2">So one of the first things we wanted to do</text><text start="660.06" dur="3.87">is just make MKBHD versions
of some of the existing stuff.</text><text start="663.93" dur="1.86">It felt too obvious, so that&amp;#39;s
exactly what we&amp;#39;re doing.</text><text start="665.79" dur="3.24">So I love carbon fiber and matte black;</text><text start="669.03" dur="1.68">I don&amp;#39;t know if you knew
that about me already,</text><text start="670.71" dur="2.55">but those are my base inspirations
for these two wallets.</text><text start="673.26" dur="2.52">So the MKBHD Carbon Fiber 3k,</text><text start="675.78" dur="1.65">this is just a bunch of lightweight,</text><text start="677.43" dur="2.37">ultra durable carbon fiber with the logo.</text><text start="679.8" dur="1.56">And then, the Matte
Black Everything Wallet,</text><text start="681.36" dur="2.01">this is just aluminum but it&amp;#39;s got this</text><text start="683.37" dur="3.3">black oil filled engravement
print, which is so sick.</text><text start="686.67" dur="0.833">And then, these wallets also come with</text><text start="687.503" dur="5">a deboss MKBHD money clip
or you can do a cash strap.</text><text start="692.52" dur="1.98">You can also attach these or detach them.</text><text start="694.5" dur="2.4">You could also do an
attachment for an AirTag,</text><text start="696.9" dur="1.83">so just make sure you don&amp;#39;t lose it.</text><text start="698.73" dur="1.47">Or, you can do like a Find My card,</text><text start="700.2" dur="0.96">which I&amp;#39;ve done as well.</text><text start="701.16" dur="2.1">But yeah, I just carry this
in my wallet all the time</text><text start="703.26" dur="1.14">and I definitely won&amp;#39;t lose it.</text><text start="704.4" dur="1.8">And, of course, if you don&amp;#39;t
like my designs, that&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="706.2" dur="3.36">Ridge has like 50 plus other
designs in their catalog.</text><text start="709.56" dur="1.584">They&amp;#39;ve got NFL licensed team stuff</text><text start="711.144" dur="2.076">if you wanna rock your team.</text><text start="713.22" dur="0.833">The store is endless.</text><text start="714.053" dur="1.957">And if you even think it
could be time to upgrade,</text><text start="716.01" dur="1.29">it&amp;#39;s a great time to just try</text><text start="717.3" dur="2.16">because if you don&amp;#39;t
love it after 99 days,</text><text start="719.46" dur="3.09">you can literally send it
right back, no questions asked.</text><text start="722.55" dur="0.833">Pretty sick.</text><text start="723.383" dur="1.357">And I&amp;#39;ll let you in on a little secret.</text><text start="724.74" dur="2.13">It&amp;#39;s 30% off the new gear right now,</text><text start="726.87" dur="2.55">but also any style if you order a wallet</text><text start="729.42" dur="2.07">and a key holder at the same time.</text><text start="731.49" dur="1.74">So just the two together, boom, 30% off.</text><text start="733.23" dur="4.2">And also 10% off whatever
you want at ridge.com/mkbhd.</text><text start="737.43" dur="1.004">You&amp;#39;re welcome.</text><text start="738.434" dur="2.176">Yeah, I&amp;#39;m excited to
be launching this stuff</text><text start="740.61" dur="2.97">and also a bunch more
coming up later this year.</text><text start="743.58" dur="1.14">I won&amp;#39;t say too much about it,</text><text start="744.72" dur="1.395">but you can sign up at the same link</text><text start="746.115" dur="1.365">if you wanna get product updates.</text><text start="747.48" dur="1.77">I&amp;#39;ve told them just to only email you</text><text start="749.25" dur="1.95">about that if you sign up.</text><text start="751.2" dur="1.11">But yeah, let me know what you think</text><text start="752.31" dur="2.79">of these new iPads in general.</text><text start="755.1" dur="2.13">I mean, it&amp;#39;s kind of an
awkward waiting period</text><text start="757.23" dur="1.401">until we get all the new iOS 18 stuff,</text><text start="758.631" dur="1.599">but let me know what you think,</text><text start="760.23" dur="2.76">new thinner than ever iPads.</text><text start="762.99" dur="2.85">Thanks for watching. Catch
you guys on the next one.</text><text start="765.84" dur="0.833">Peace.</text></transcript>
