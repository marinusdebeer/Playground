<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.54" dur="2.7">- All right, I review a
lot of products, right?</text><text start="3.24" dur="2.04">I&amp;#39;ve talked about hundreds,</text><text start="5.28" dur="3.12">maybe thousands of products at this point,</text><text start="8.4" dur="2.01">but as many videos as
I&amp;#39;ve made about products,</text><text start="10.41" dur="2.22">there are way more products out there</text><text start="12.63" dur="1.23">in the world that exist.</text><text start="13.86" dur="4.77">So the process of selecting which products</text><text start="18.63" dur="1.47">to even review in the first place</text><text start="20.1" dur="1.53">is like an art form to itself.</text><text start="21.63" dur="1.92">Most products are just,</text><text start="23.55" dur="1.71">meh, they&amp;#39;re fine.</text><text start="25.26" dur="0.87">Like they exist,</text><text start="26.13" dur="2.46">they get made, they&amp;#39;re fine, whatever.</text><text start="28.59" dur="3.12">So they have to reach a
certain level of interest</text><text start="31.71" dur="4.023">or being really good to even
be considered for review,</text><text start="36.78" dur="3.69">or sometimes really, really bad.</text><text start="40.47" dur="0.99">So there&amp;#39;s been a lotta</text><text start="41.46" dur="2.82">interesting discourse
lately on this topic.</text><text start="44.28" dur="2.07">There will be, you know,
some negative reviews,</text><text start="46.35" dur="3.54">and then a company will
eventually go out of business.</text><text start="49.89" dur="2.137">And then the internet poses the question,</text><text start="52.027" dur="3.833">&amp;quot;Do bad reviews kill companies?&amp;quot;</text><text start="55.86" dur="3.93">Do bad reviews kill companies?</text><text start="59.79" dur="3.933">Or do bad products kill companies?</text><text start="65.52" dur="1.38">Yeah, I do have a lot of thoughts.</text><text start="66.9" dur="2.61">So two of the biggest examples
that have been pointed to,</text><text start="69.51" dur="1.02">especially on Twitter,</text><text start="70.53" dur="2.82">were the Fisker Ocean review that I did</text><text start="73.35" dur="3.42">and the Humane AI Pin
from a couple days ago.</text><text start="76.77" dur="2.94">So the Fisker saga was
pretty well documented,</text><text start="79.71" dur="1.11">but in case you missed it,</text><text start="80.82" dur="1.41">I reviewed a car,</text><text start="82.23" dur="2.28">I had a pretty horrible
experience with it,</text><text start="84.51" dur="2.19">documented it, published the review</text><text start="86.7" dur="1.59">on the Auto Focus channel,</text><text start="88.29" dur="1.74">and then a few months later,</text><text start="90.03" dur="3.18">the entire company appears
to be on life support,</text><text start="93.21" dur="2.76">like likely filing for bankruptcy soon.</text><text start="95.97" dur="3.15">And now this startup, Humane, you know,</text><text start="99.12" dur="2.01">they dropped their
first product, this pin.</text><text start="101.13" dur="2.13">I review it, it&amp;#39;s not super positive.</text><text start="103.26" dur="2.79">A lot of people are saying the same thing,</text><text start="106.05" dur="2.43">and I don&amp;#39;t even think Humane
is going anywhere, by the way.</text><text start="108.48" dur="3.66">But I think there is some
pretty simple logic we can use</text><text start="112.14" dur="3.78">to decipher what the real
danger is to these companies,</text><text start="115.92" dur="4.59">which is, do you still get
a bunch of negative reviews</text><text start="120.51" dur="1.8">and then die as a company</text><text start="122.31" dur="3.21">if the product is actually really good?</text><text start="125.52" dur="1.56">But you know what, let&amp;#39;s
back up for a second.</text><text start="127.08" dur="2.4">What is a review?</text><text start="129.48" dur="1.35">Little pet peeve of mine is I think people</text><text start="130.83" dur="2.22">misuse or overuse that word a lot,</text><text start="133.05" dur="3">but a review is just,
somebody uses the product</text><text start="136.05" dur="2.43">and then just delivers their impressions</text><text start="138.48" dur="1.53">on whether they think
it&amp;#39;s any good or not,</text><text start="140.01" dur="1.26">how well it actually worked.</text><text start="141.27" dur="1.98">And if their honest
opinion is if it&amp;#39;s good,</text><text start="143.25" dur="0.84">then that&amp;#39;s the review.</text><text start="144.09" dur="2.46">If it&amp;#39;s bad, that&amp;#39;s the review.</text><text start="146.55" dur="1.14">That&amp;#39;s basically it.</text><text start="147.69" dur="3.09">And so I&amp;#39;ve been a advocate
of good independent reviews</text><text start="150.78" dur="1.83">for what feels like forever now.</text><text start="152.61" dur="4.8">But the thing about reviews
is if they&amp;#39;re not honest,</text><text start="157.41" dur="1.89">then they&amp;#39;re basically useless.</text><text start="159.3" dur="1.71">I really strongly feel like</text><text start="161.01" dur="2.22">everything that comes from a review,</text><text start="163.23" dur="2.4">all the consequences and
everything that comes around it,</text><text start="165.63" dur="3.87">everything in the world of
and ecosystem of reviews</text><text start="169.5" dur="3.33">depends on the review being truthful</text><text start="172.83" dur="1.56">and actually honest about things.</text><text start="174.39" dur="1.29">So, I&amp;#39;ll just give you an example.</text><text start="175.68" dur="1.14">I&amp;#39;ve told this story before,</text><text start="176.82" dur="1.5">but years ago I remember</text><text start="178.32" dur="2.82">I reviewed the first Razer
Phone when it came out.</text><text start="181.14" dur="2.49">So Razer, gaming company,
they make lots of stuff.</text><text start="183.63" dur="1.5">They were getting into
smartphones for the first time.</text><text start="185.13" dur="1.47">So they made a phone</text><text start="186.6" dur="3">that appeals to the same
target demographic of gamers.</text><text start="189.6" dur="2.4">So, you know, it had a bunch
of upsides and downsides.</text><text start="192" dur="1.68">Obviously gaming focused features,</text><text start="193.68" dur="1.68">so it&amp;#39;s got like front-facing speakers</text><text start="195.36" dur="1.47">and a high refresh rate.</text><text start="196.83" dur="3.39">The battery&amp;#39;s pretty big,
but also the camera was weak.</text><text start="200.22" dur="1.98">And I specifically, I remember,</text><text start="202.2" dur="2.43">the vibration motor was horrible.</text><text start="204.63" dur="0.99">And I remember calling it out.</text><text start="205.62" dur="1.02">I remember saying this.</text><text start="206.64" dur="3.09">Also the vibration motor
in this phone, trash.</text><text start="209.73" dur="0.84">Straight trash.</text><text start="210.57" dur="2.529">I&amp;#39;m gonna call myself
so you can hear this.</text><text start="213.099" dur="3.833">(phone ringing and vibrating)</text><text start="218.053" dur="3.833">(phone ringing and vibrating)</text><text start="222.87" dur="1.95">It sounds broken like it&amp;#39;s,</text><text start="224.82" dur="2.04">but it sounded that way
out the box since day one.</text><text start="226.86" dur="1.11">So that is the Razer Phone.</text><text start="227.97" dur="2.01">Just one of the worst vibration motors</text><text start="229.98" dur="2.49">I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced in a new phone.</text><text start="232.47" dur="3.09">So, okay, fast forward a year, right?</text><text start="235.56" dur="2.37">I&amp;#39;m at a briefing, it&amp;#39;s in New York City,</text><text start="237.93" dur="2.43">it&amp;#39;s for the Razer Phone 2.</text><text start="240.36" dur="1.53">And so they&amp;#39;re walkin&amp;#39; me</text><text start="241.89" dur="1.83">and some other people through
this new phone they&amp;#39;ve made,</text><text start="243.72" dur="1.17">and they&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of changes.</text><text start="244.89" dur="1.23">It&amp;#39;s got a glossy back.</text><text start="246.12" dur="1.86">They added wireless charging now.</text><text start="247.98" dur="2.28">The logo glows and like
the speakers are better</text><text start="250.26" dur="2.46">and all this stuff, and
they&amp;#39;re talkin&amp;#39; us through it.</text><text start="252.72" dur="1.507">And then the guy turns to me and he says,</text><text start="254.227" dur="2.58">&amp;quot;And Marques, you gotta try</text><text start="256.807" dur="3.413">&amp;quot;the new vibration motor in this phone.&amp;quot;</text><text start="260.22" dur="1.47">And it&amp;#39;s such a niche thing,</text><text start="261.69" dur="3.6">but, sure enough, I try
it, and it&amp;#39;s way better.</text><text start="265.29" dur="2.76">And that&amp;#39;s, to me,</text><text start="268.05" dur="2.22">that&amp;#39;s a big part of what
reviews are all about.</text><text start="270.27" dur="3.27">That honest feedback
turned into actually action</text><text start="273.54" dur="1.83">for the company to make it better.</text><text start="275.37" dur="1.26">So people who bought the first one</text><text start="276.63" dur="1.17">knew what they were getting into,</text><text start="277.8" dur="1.59">and people who bought the second one</text><text start="279.39" dur="1.98">actually benefited from that.</text><text start="281.37" dur="2.4">So that&amp;#39;s number one, honesty
obviously super important.</text><text start="283.77" dur="3.48">But the second thing is these reviews</text><text start="287.25" dur="3.09">are also definitely for the people</text><text start="290.34" dur="2.73">that are watching them and consuming them.</text><text start="293.07" dur="1.47">So you&amp;#39;ve probably been in this situation</text><text start="294.54" dur="1.62">when you&amp;#39;re about to buy something</text><text start="296.16" dur="1.14">and you just wanna double check,</text><text start="297.3" dur="2.4">so you hop on YouTube, you search it up,</text><text start="299.7" dur="1.65">watch a couple videos about the product,</text><text start="301.35" dur="2.25">just to make sure you&amp;#39;re
not missin&amp;#39; anything,</text><text start="303.6" dur="1.77">and then you either decide on the moment</text><text start="305.37" dur="1.56">or later that day, like, okay,</text><text start="306.93" dur="1.29">yeah, I&amp;#39;m definitely gonna buy it.</text><text start="308.22" dur="1.26">We&amp;#39;ve all been there.</text><text start="309.48" dur="1.74">That&amp;#39;s the reason,</text><text start="311.22" dur="2.79">that&amp;#39;s exactly how this
YouTube channel started.</text><text start="314.01" dur="4.08">Like, my first ever tech
video was reviewing a laptop,</text><text start="318.09" dur="2.58">but specifically, I bought the laptop</text><text start="320.67" dur="2.13">with my allowance money in high school,</text><text start="322.8" dur="1.83">and I found a Windows Media Center remote</text><text start="324.63" dur="3.15">in the PCI slot that wasn&amp;#39;t
in any of the other reviews.</text><text start="327.78" dur="1.29">So the first thing I decided to do</text><text start="329.07" dur="1.92">was talk through it in a video</text><text start="330.99" dur="2.49">so that anyone else who
bought the laptop after me</text><text start="333.48" dur="0.833">would know about it.</text><text start="334.313" dur="1.597">So you&amp;#39;re thinking about buying a thing,</text><text start="335.91" dur="2.55">you watch a couple reviews of the thing,</text><text start="338.46" dur="2.25">you learn everything you
need to know, boom, success.</text><text start="340.71" dur="2.91">But here&amp;#39;s where it gets
a little bit interesting.</text><text start="343.62" dur="2.37">I do have a bit of an extra dimension</text><text start="345.99" dur="1.65">on my hands with these videos,</text><text start="347.64" dur="3.03">because I know that there&amp;#39;s no way</text><text start="350.67" dur="2.61">that every single person watching a review</text><text start="353.28" dur="2.13">of every single product</text><text start="355.41" dur="3.06">is one of those people who
was considering buying it.</text><text start="358.47" dur="2.801">I get that comment actually
in person all the time.</text><text start="361.271" dur="0.833">&amp;quot;I watch the reviews even though</text><text start="362.104" dur="1.886">&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not buyin&amp;#39; any of this stuff.&amp;quot;</text><text start="363.99" dur="1.68">So I know that a lot of people,</text><text start="365.67" dur="1.74">in fact, most people
watching these videos,</text><text start="367.41" dur="4.68">are actually just here to watch
an interesting, informative,</text><text start="372.09" dur="4.44">good video in general,
an entertaining video.</text><text start="376.53" dur="3.78">And so the way that I satisfy those things</text><text start="380.31" dur="2.07">is much more subjective, I think.</text><text start="382.38" dur="1.62">Like everyone has a
different way they do it.</text><text start="384" dur="2.25">Everyone has a different
target demographic,</text><text start="386.25" dur="1.86">but that&amp;#39;s a little
bit of a new dimension.</text><text start="388.11" dur="1.83">So then I think if we go back
to the original question.</text><text start="389.94" dur="4.32">So can a video kill a company?</text><text start="394.26" dur="5">I&amp;#39;ll use the Humane and
Fisker examples specifically.</text><text start="399.33" dur="2.88">The Fisker Ocean was a terrible car.</text><text start="402.21" dur="1.23">It is a terrible car.</text><text start="403.44" dur="2.278">I&amp;#39;ve reviewed about 40,</text><text start="405.718" dur="2.912">50 different cars in the past few years,</text><text start="408.63" dur="1.89">made videos about many of them.</text><text start="410.52" dur="2.52">This is the first one where I genuinely</text><text start="413.04" dur="2.4">couldn&amp;#39;t wait to be done driving it.</text><text start="415.44" dur="2.34">Like it just had tons of problems,</text><text start="417.78" dur="2.88">bugs, missing features, safety issues.</text><text start="420.66" dur="1.26">Like it&amp;#39;s just bad, right?</text><text start="421.92" dur="0.833">So I review the thing,</text><text start="422.753" dur="3.577">I give people what I
feel is a fair assessment</text><text start="426.33" dur="4.26">that also doubles as a warning
not to buy this bad car.</text><text start="430.59" dur="2.22">So hopefully it&amp;#39;s
entertaining and informative</text><text start="432.81" dur="1.71">to the majority of people who weren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="434.52" dur="0.87">thinking about buying the car,</text><text start="435.39" dur="2.79">but also that it is as honest as possible</text><text start="438.18" dur="0.99">with the people who are.</text><text start="439.17" dur="2.4">And maybe a week or two later,</text><text start="441.57" dur="4.32">the company&amp;#39;s stock price is
plummeting to an all-time low</text><text start="445.89" dur="3.27">and they appear to be like
filing for bankruptcy.</text><text start="449.16" dur="2.25">Cue the internet, going nuts,</text><text start="451.41" dur="2.07">which I guess I get it.</text><text start="453.48" dur="1.65">Like obviously it makes a nice headline.</text><text start="455.13" dur="3.63">Like, oh, this review came out
and it killed this company.</text><text start="458.76" dur="3.3">This review bankrupted
all of Fisker, maybe.</text><text start="462.06" dur="1.86">Like there was a whole Morning Brew thread</text><text start="463.92" dur="2.31">on how Fisker handled this video so poorly</text><text start="466.23" dur="2.25">that they&amp;#39;re now gonna go
bankrupt because of it.</text><text start="468.48" dur="3.72">Also, there were whole stock
investments theme channels</text><text start="472.2" dur="3.63">saying this was like
a paid promoted attack</text><text start="475.83" dur="1.41">against the Fisker stock price.</text><text start="477.24" dur="1.32">Like it got pretty crazy.</text><text start="478.56" dur="4.743">But did one review kill
the entire company?</text><text start="484.98" dur="2.04">I would say to zoom out a bit.</text><text start="487.02" dur="1.11">I would really...</text><text start="488.13" dur="2.01">I think it&amp;#39;s important to
zoom out a bit, actually.</text><text start="490.14" dur="1.59">First of all, I was not the only one</text><text start="491.73" dur="1.41">to review the car, not even close.</text><text start="493.14" dur="3.3">And so yes, the stock price
did drop after my video,</text><text start="496.44" dur="1.59">but the stock was in free fall</text><text start="498.03" dur="3.36">for many, many months
before my video, too.</text><text start="501.39" dur="1.53">And if you zoom out on YouTube</text><text start="502.92" dur="2.25">or in the car review space in general,</text><text start="505.17" dur="2.4">I was far from the only
person saying these things</text><text start="507.57" dur="1.74">about the car for all of these months.</text><text start="509.31" dur="3.09">Many other reviewers had been
having a plethora of issues,</text><text start="512.4" dur="2.37">even stuff that I didn&amp;#39;t
have with this thing.</text><text start="514.77" dur="1.11">I actually, I feel like that might be</text><text start="515.88" dur="3.99">the easiest way to tell if
a review is honest or not.</text><text start="519.87" dur="1.231">Like,</text><text start="521.101" dur="4.229">we&amp;#39;re all reviewing the
same product basically.</text><text start="525.33" dur="1.17">We all have the same thing,</text><text start="526.5" dur="1.68">so we&amp;#39;re all gonna find
a lot of the same things.</text><text start="528.18" dur="1.53">We&amp;#39;re all eventually going to have</text><text start="529.71" dur="2.19">a lot of the same upsides, downsides.</text><text start="531.9" dur="2.43">If there are issues they
may eventually surface.</text><text start="534.33" dur="4.02">So yeah, they&amp;#39;re probably
gonna agree with each other.</text><text start="538.35" dur="1.02">A bunch of honest reviews.</text><text start="539.37" dur="1.65">They&amp;#39;ll all say a lot of the same stuff.</text><text start="541.02" dur="2.67">Oh, and also, in the U.S. the stock price,</text><text start="543.69" dur="3.21">there&amp;#39;s this thing where
if a stock, what is it?</text><text start="546.9" dur="4.14">If it&amp;#39;s below a dollar for
however many days in a row,</text><text start="551.04" dur="2.76">then they&amp;#39;ll get a warning
that they may be de-listed</text><text start="553.8" dur="1.65">and they have six months
to get the stock price</text><text start="555.45" dur="2.07">back up over a dollar.</text><text start="557.52" dur="3.6">And Fisker had just received that notice,</text><text start="561.12" dur="2.04">right around the same time that my,</text><text start="563.16" dur="2.28">I think right before my
video came out, actually.</text><text start="565.44" dur="2.07">And if you&amp;#39;re an investor,
you&amp;#39;re looking at that,</text><text start="567.51" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s the type of stuff that
really tanks the stock price,</text><text start="570.72" dur="1.05">if you&amp;#39;re askin&amp;#39; me.</text><text start="571.77" dur="1.32">And if you&amp;#39;re askin&amp;#39; me personally,</text><text start="573.09" dur="3.6">I literally don&amp;#39;t care
what the stock price is</text><text start="576.69" dur="3.09">of any company, of any product I review.</text><text start="579.78" dur="2.22">I just don&amp;#39;t care. (chuckling)</text><text start="582" dur="2.25">And so if I&amp;#39;m talking about a product</text><text start="584.25" dur="2.1">that will never have anything to do with</text><text start="586.35" dur="1.44">what I say about the product,</text><text start="587.79" dur="2.7">and I hope that&amp;#39;s not true
about other people either.</text><text start="590.49" dur="0.96">And I shouldn&amp;#39;t even have to say this.</text><text start="591.45" dur="3.09">I&amp;#39;m not invested in any
companies that I cover.</text><text start="594.54" dur="4.47">It&amp;#39;s just a matter of trying
to make an informative,</text><text start="599.01" dur="3.24">educational, and honest video review.</text><text start="602.25" dur="0.87">That&amp;#39;s my goal.</text><text start="603.12" dur="1.65">My only goal is to do that.</text><text start="604.77" dur="2.16">And I don&amp;#39;t have any duty
to any of the companies</text><text start="606.93" dur="1.11">whose products I cover.</text><text start="608.04" dur="1.92">It is only to the people
watching the videos.</text><text start="609.96" dur="3.03">So now, okay, fast forward
to, you know, pretty recently,</text><text start="612.99" dur="4.02">the Humane AI Pin comes out.</text><text start="617.01" dur="1.56">A lot of the same stuff, right?</text><text start="618.57" dur="3.33">Like this pin has a lot
of missing promises that,</text><text start="621.9" dur="1.11">you know, the things it does,</text><text start="623.01" dur="1.71">it doesn&amp;#39;t actually do super well.</text><text start="624.72" dur="2.34">The battery life is bad, it overheats.</text><text start="627.06" dur="1.71">The laser projector is kinda bad.</text><text start="628.77" dur="1.44">Like the list just goes on and on.</text><text start="630.21" dur="2.22">I tried to be as fair as possible</text><text start="632.43" dur="1.53">and as informative as possible,</text><text start="633.96" dur="2.52">but I&amp;#39;m also absolutely
not about to sugarcoat</text><text start="636.48" dur="3.367">or leave anything out
to protect any company&amp;#39;s</text><text start="639.847" dur="2.423">$700 device with a monthly subscription.</text><text start="642.27" dur="0.87">Not into that.</text><text start="643.14" dur="1.35">But yet, even still,</text><text start="644.49" dur="2.49">there are some threads blowing up saying</text><text start="646.98" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s extra bad what I
did to this poor company.</text><text start="649.98" dur="1.68">And you know, maybe you could argue</text><text start="651.66" dur="2.58">since this is the biggest
channel that covered it,</text><text start="654.24" dur="2.19">maybe there&amp;#39;s some extra impact there.</text><text start="656.43" dur="2.553">But again, I would say to zoom out.</text><text start="660.24" dur="1.143">Just zoom out again.</text><text start="662.46" dur="1.8">I was not the first, actually, even,</text><text start="664.26" dur="1.08">to cover the Humane Pin,</text><text start="665.34" dur="2.01">but I&amp;#39;m also far from the
only one to talk about it.</text><text start="667.35" dur="1.59">And even a little inside baseball,</text><text start="668.94" dur="5">when a product comes out that&amp;#39;s
this notable or this bad,</text><text start="674.34" dur="2.88">which isn&amp;#39;t very often,
a lot of reviewers,</text><text start="677.22" dur="1.98">like it&amp;#39;s a very...</text><text start="679.2" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s stressful.</text><text start="680.033" dur="1.717">You wanna make sure you
get everything right.</text><text start="681.75" dur="2.1">A lot of us are literally trading notes</text><text start="683.85" dur="1.11">and like trying to figure out,</text><text start="684.96" dur="2.01">like when mine died in two hours</text><text start="686.97" dur="1.95">and overheated on my chest
without doing anything,</text><text start="688.92" dur="3.24">I thought it was like an issue with mine,</text><text start="692.16" dur="1.59">and I was texting a couple others,</text><text start="693.75" dur="1.11">and sure enough,</text><text start="694.86" dur="1.47">they&amp;#39;re having the same
things happen to them.</text><text start="696.33" dur="3.72">So we&amp;#39;re all trying to be
as thorough as possible</text><text start="700.05" dur="2.52">and making sure reviews are truthful.</text><text start="702.57" dur="1.95">And so that&amp;#39;s how you get a
bunch of truthful reviews.</text><text start="704.52" dur="0.93">Now you could argue,</text><text start="705.45" dur="1.83">and I think the guy on Twitter did,</text><text start="707.28" dur="3.36">that the packaging was too clickbaity.</text><text start="710.64" dur="1.35">And I totally get that.</text><text start="711.99" dur="2.97">But I also stand by our
title and thumbnail,</text><text start="714.96" dur="1.95">and especially the end of the title.</text><text start="716.91" dur="1.98">But keep in mind the dimension</text><text start="718.89" dur="3.75">that most of the people
who see this in their feed,</text><text start="722.64" dur="1.53">in their subscription box,</text><text start="724.17" dur="2.82">have never heard of the Humane AI Pin.</text><text start="726.99" dur="1.68">And this will be the first
time they hear about it,</text><text start="728.67" dur="1.65">and they click on it, hopefully,</text><text start="730.32" dur="2.7">and then they&amp;#39;re delivered
with a thoughtful,</text><text start="733.02" dur="3.6">well-considered, balanced,
and honest, and entertaining,</text><text start="736.62" dur="3.09">and informative video that
happens to be a review.</text><text start="739.71" dur="5">So look, I&amp;#39;ve reviewed a lot
of bad products in my day.</text><text start="744.72" dur="1.23">You might remember some of them.</text><text start="745.95" dur="1.5">You might remember the Dyson headphones</text><text start="747.45" dur="3.27">or the Red Hydrogen
One or the Pixel Slate,</text><text start="750.72" dur="1.56">or the HTCU Ultra.</text><text start="752.28" dur="0.99">The list goes on.</text><text start="753.27" dur="2.88">But one thing has definitely been clear</text><text start="756.15" dur="1.47">and consistent throughout all of this,</text><text start="757.62" dur="3.63">which is anytime the company goes under,</text><text start="761.25" dur="3.21">you don&amp;#39;t get those bad reviews</text><text start="764.46" dur="4.47">without the product being
bad to begin with, obviously.</text><text start="768.93" dur="2.52">I have a massive amount of
respect and appreciation</text><text start="771.45" dur="1.8">for people and groups of people</text><text start="773.25" dur="3.96">who are actually making new
stuff, like building products.</text><text start="777.21" dur="1.53">That&amp;#39;s the hard part,
at the end of the day.</text><text start="778.74" dur="2.07">And we get to get a whole
bunch of new exciting things</text><text start="780.81" dur="2.88">that might change the world,
and that&amp;#39;s really exciting.</text><text start="783.69" dur="3.933">But my reviews technically
are not for them.</text><text start="788.67" dur="3.81">All that any honest review actually does</text><text start="792.48" dur="3.423">is just accelerate whatever
was already going on.</text><text start="797.1" dur="1.05">Think of it that way.</text><text start="799.05" dur="1.92">Okay, thanks for watchin&amp;#39;.</text><text start="800.97" dur="0.833">Catch you guys on the next one.</text><text start="801.803" dur="1.399">Peace.</text><text start="803.202" dur="3.25">(upbeat relaxed music)</text></transcript>
