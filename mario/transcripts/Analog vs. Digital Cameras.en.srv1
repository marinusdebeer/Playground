 talk with Rik Cordero,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="8.074" dur="1.535">&lt;i&gt; a filmmaker who&amp;#39;s directed
 music videos&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="9.642" dur="3.404">&lt;i&gt; with retro aesthetics
 for artists like Nas,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="13.079" dur="1.468">&lt;i&gt; Q-Tip, and The Roots.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="14.58" dur="1.469">&lt;i&gt; Rik is here
 to help me compare&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="16.082" dur="2.202">&lt;i&gt; the analog look
 of digital cameras&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="18.317" dur="3.204">&lt;i&gt; versus the look of
 the original JVC camcorder.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="21.554" dur="2.035">So, this is it.
What I was using</text><text start="23.622" dur="2.003">&lt;i&gt; when I was making
 these music videos&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="25.658" dur="2.102">was the Panasonic HVX--</text><text start="27.793" dur="2.837">something that bridged
the gap between consumer</text><text start="30.663" dur="1.935">and professional equipment,</text><text start="32.631" dur="2.603">and it had this lived-in look.</text><text start="35.267" dur="1.335">Great, let&amp;#39;s see
if we can put it together.</text><text start="36.635" dur="2.537">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="42.174" dur="2.67">- This is now adapted.
- It is.</text><text start="44.877" dur="4.271">- What I have here today
  is that first JVC camera.
- Oh, my God.</text><text start="49.181" dur="2.303">I&amp;#39;m really excited</text><text start="51.517" dur="1.802">to see what it looks like
next to this thing.</text><text start="53.352" dur="2.103">Who&amp;#39;s gonna carry
the lighter camera?
That&amp;#39;s the question.</text><text start="55.488" dur="3.003">- I got this one.
- Thanks.</text><text start="60.226" dur="1.836">( muttering )</text><text start="68.467" dur="1.135">The only bummer
was not having a screen</text><text start="69.635" dur="1.702">- to see anything.
- Yeah.</text><text start="71.37" dur="2.103">Now that we&amp;#39;ve shot with this,
we should switch over</text><text start="73.506" dur="2.803">- and see what
  the Panasonic system&amp;#39;s like.
- Yeah. Yeah.</text><text start="84.383" dur="1.902">- How was that?
- Pretty good.</text><text start="86.318" dur="1.235">It was framed pretty well,
and I could see it.</text><text start="87.586" dur="1.235">When you have the viewfinder,</text><text start="88.854" dur="1.535">you feel more confident
in your shots.</text><text start="90.422" dur="1.703">Marques:&lt;i&gt; Yeah.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="92.158" dur="1.301">All right, well, let&amp;#39;s look
at them side by side.</text><text start="93.492" dur="2.77">All right,
so let&amp;#39;s check out the JVC.</text><text start="96.295" dur="3.037">- ( whirring )
- I love that motorized
  sound that it makes.</text><text start="99.365" dur="2.236">- That&amp;#39;s a long sound.
- It is.</text><text start="101.634" dur="1.201">- I&amp;#39;m not even gonna lie.
- You ever see--</text><text start="102.868" dur="1.936">- You ever see &amp;quot;RoboCop&amp;quot;?
- No.</text><text start="104.837" dur="1.435">Cordero:&lt;i&gt;
 They recorded the sounds of,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="106.305" dur="2.469">&lt;i&gt; like, VCRs and VHS camcorders&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="108.807" dur="1.869">as the sounds
of when RoboCop walked.</text><text start="110.709" dur="1.736">( whirring )</text><text start="112.478" dur="2.336">Thank you for your cooperation.
Good night.</text><text start="114.847" dur="1.635">( whirring )</text><text start="116.515" dur="1.836">That actually makes
a lot of sense.</text><text start="120.953" dur="3.337">- Almost everything that&amp;#39;s
  in highlight is blown out.
-&lt;i&gt; Yeah.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="124.323" dur="3.037">- Uh, not as wide as I thought.
- There you go. There you go.</text><text start="127.393" dur="2.469">We&amp;#39;re seeing the disadvantage
of not having a viewfinder.</text><text start="129.895" dur="3.004">- Yeah. It looks like
  found footage.
- Yeah.</text><text start="132.932" dur="1.401">We were going for that look.</text><text start="134.366" dur="1.836">So, this is really
taking me back.</text><text start="136.235" dur="3.537">&lt;i&gt; I was filming VHS movies
 when I was 13 years old.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="139.805" dur="2.87">Nothing was perfect, and that&amp;#39;s
what made it feel real.</text><text start="142.708" dur="3.17">You can add
all the after effects,
plug-ins you want,</text><text start="145.911" dur="2.803">&lt;i&gt; and you&amp;#39;re not gonna achieve
 what&amp;#39;s happening here.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="148.747" dur="1.836"> Marques:&lt;i&gt; Not something that
 could easily be replicated.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="150.616" dur="2.603">- Rik:&lt;i&gt; No. &lt;/i&gt;
- Next step is to check out</text><text start="153.252" dur="3.637">what the Panasonic system
kicked up. Pause this.</text><text start="156.922" dur="3.471">Rik: So we&amp;#39;ll play
the first clip. All right.</text><text start="160.426" dur="1.769">The framing&amp;#39;s
instantly way better,</text><text start="162.228" dur="1.435">much more dynamic range,</text><text start="163.696" dur="2.836">and, yeah,
colors look way better.</text><text start="166.565" dur="3.07">The thing I like is
that you still have this
filmic look to it.</text><text start="169.668" dur="4.071">It&amp;#39;s a look
that I think really advanced
the look of VHS.</text><text start="173.772" dur="3.004">If I were to pick
between these two rigs,
I would still pick this one,</text><text start="176.809" dur="2.903">even though it&amp;#39;s
a little more taxing
to set up and carry.</text><text start="179.745" dur="2.503">But at the end of the day,
this is the grandaddy
of it all.</text><text start="182.281" dur="2.136">Rik:&lt;i&gt; Yeah, that&amp;#39;s the one
 that kicked off everything.&lt;/i&gt;</text></transcript>
