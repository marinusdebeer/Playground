<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.63" dur="0.93">- All right, we gotta talk about these</text><text start="1.56" dur="0.84">folding phones for a minute,</text><text start="2.4" dur="2.46">because it&amp;#39;s changed a lot
since the last time we did.</text><text start="4.86" dur="2.79">So the first ever folding
phone from OnePlus</text><text start="7.65" dur="0.99">came out this week.</text><text start="8.64" dur="2.246">It&amp;#39;s called the OnePlus Open.</text><text start="10.886" dur="1.324">Not a very good name,</text><text start="12.21" dur="2.46">but a very, very, very good,</text><text start="14.67" dur="1.05">first gen foldable.</text><text start="15.72" dur="1.89">I&amp;#39;ve been using it for
about three weeks now.</text><text start="17.61" dur="1.44">I got lots of good things to say about it,</text><text start="19.05" dur="1.95">but it&amp;#39;s actually, I
feel like it&amp;#39;s so good,</text><text start="21" dur="2.88">that it&amp;#39;s actually resurfaced
the old question in my head</text><text start="23.88" dur="2.19">from a couple years ago, which is,</text><text start="26.07" dur="1.74">what&amp;#39;s it gonna take for regular people</text><text start="27.81" dur="2.4">to actually start buying folding phones?</text><text start="30.21" dur="1.8">Because, yeah, I like this phone,</text><text start="32.01" dur="1.56">and I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and guess that</text><text start="33.57" dur="2.49">some other reviewers
will like this phone too,</text><text start="36.06" dur="2.04">and some enthusiasts will like this phone,</text><text start="38.1" dur="2.37">and this video may even
get a lot of views,</text><text start="40.47" dur="3">but none of that necessarily translates</text><text start="43.47" dur="2.82">into regular people just
like, strolling into a store,</text><text start="46.29" dur="3.45">or going online and choosing
to buy one of these.</text><text start="49.74" dur="1.98">So first things first,
the details of this phone.</text><text start="51.72" dur="3.99">So this is a super high-end
phone in every way,</text><text start="55.71" dur="2.67">and the design is
particularly well considered.</text><text start="58.38" dur="2.37">You can see it&amp;#39;s basically the same size</text><text start="60.75" dur="1.413">as a normal phone on the outside.</text><text start="62.163" dur="3.987">This is a 6.3 inch, 20
by nine cover display,</text><text start="66.15" dur="1.26">just over 1080p.</text><text start="67.41" dur="2.19">It&amp;#39;s LTPO down to 10 hertz,</text><text start="69.6" dur="5">and it&amp;#39;s an absurdly bright
2800 nits max brightness</text><text start="74.82" dur="1.62">between these pretty thin bezels.</text><text start="76.44" dur="1.59">So this actually does take the crown now</text><text start="78.03" dur="3.63">for the brightest display I
have ever seen in a smartphone.</text><text start="81.66" dur="2.85">And I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead
and give it the co-crown</text><text start="84.51" dur="3.18">for best foldable to use while closed,</text><text start="87.69" dur="1.56">alongside the Pixel Fold.</text><text start="89.25" dur="1.8">So I still think the Pixel Fold has,</text><text start="91.05" dur="1.98">it&amp;#39;s more reachable, it has
better button placement,</text><text start="93.03" dur="1.41">since it&amp;#39;s a bit shorter.</text><text start="94.44" dur="2.67">But there&amp;#39;s no question this
feels like a flagship phone</text><text start="97.11" dur="2.97">on the outside, even if you
never even open the thing.</text><text start="100.08" dur="2.46">There&amp;#39;s also a bunch of
design touches I really like,</text><text start="102.54" dur="2.94">the flat sides all the
way around, super clean.</text><text start="105.48" dur="2.01">The alert slider is also back,</text><text start="107.49" dur="2.16">so it&amp;#39;s way up there at
the top of the phone,</text><text start="109.65" dur="1.02">which is kind of tough to reach,</text><text start="110.67" dur="2.73">but I love that it works
exactly as you&amp;#39;d expect.</text><text start="113.4" dur="2.91">Same as previous OnePlus
phones that had it.</text><text start="116.31" dur="2.25">And the power button also doubles
as the fingerprint reader,</text><text start="118.56" dur="2.19">which we&amp;#39;ve seen with lots
of these folds as well.</text><text start="120.75" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s awesome.</text><text start="121.583" dur="1.477">And then around the back,</text><text start="123.06" dur="1.44">mixed bag, I would say.</text><text start="124.5" dur="1.38">I&amp;#39;m not the biggest fake leather</text><text start="125.88" dur="1.2">on the back of a phone person.</text><text start="127.08" dur="2.981">It gives me like, Samsung 2016 vibes,</text><text start="130.061" dur="1.879">but at least it does hide fingerprints.</text><text start="131.94" dur="0.99">This is the other color now.</text><text start="132.93" dur="1.41">It&amp;#39;s a green.</text><text start="134.34" dur="0.99">It looks a little bit cleaner.</text><text start="135.33" dur="2.73">But really, the feature is
the gigantic camera bump.</text><text start="138.06" dur="1.59">And yeah, it&amp;#39;s pretty crazy looking,</text><text start="139.65" dur="2.37">but, but, it also happens to be</text><text start="142.02" dur="1.588">exactly where my index finger rests</text><text start="143.608" dur="1.922">on the back of the phone.</text><text start="145.53" dur="1.77">So it&amp;#39;s like a nice little shelf</text><text start="147.3" dur="3.03">that feels really natural when
using the phone while closed.</text><text start="150.33" dur="2.22">So I kind of really like it for that.</text><text start="152.55" dur="1.38">Also, the LED flash.</text><text start="153.93" dur="0.99">I guess it couldn&amp;#39;t fit,</text><text start="154.92" dur="2.25">so they shoved it up in the
corner, for some reason.</text><text start="157.17" dur="1.68">But, then you open this thing up,</text><text start="158.85" dur="2.683">and it just, it becomes so
obvious why they waited so long</text><text start="161.533" dur="1.817">to do their first foldable.</text><text start="163.35" dur="2.49">It looks nothing like some of the other</text><text start="165.84" dur="2.79">first gen folding screens from years ago.</text><text start="168.63" dur="2.85">It&amp;#39;s got this huge 7.8
inch corner to corner,</text><text start="171.48" dur="2.88">LTPO 3.0 display, that again,</text><text start="174.36" dur="3.93">goes up to 2800 nits,
and down to one hertz.</text><text start="178.29" dur="1.5">Even bezels all the way around,</text><text start="179.79" dur="1.44">got the hole punch in the top corner.</text><text start="181.23" dur="2.7">And honestly, one of the
least visible creases</text><text start="183.93" dur="2.28">you will see in a folding phone in 2023.</text><text start="186.21" dur="2.1">Now I think it&amp;#39;s actually debatable</text><text start="188.31" dur="2.7">if we can technically call this
their first foldable phone,</text><text start="191.01" dur="2.769">because while OnePlus
hasn&amp;#39;t made a foldable yet,</text><text start="193.779" dur="2.961">their sister company, OPPO, clearly has.</text><text start="196.74" dur="1.05">So I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text><text start="197.79" dur="1.5">if this took a lot of tech from them.</text><text start="199.29" dur="2.79">Actually, there is another
just released OPPO phone</text><text start="202.08" dur="3.75">called the OPPO Find N3,
and it&amp;#39;s the same as this,</text><text start="205.83" dur="0.9">but the point still stands.</text><text start="206.73" dur="1.05">And with this screen on,</text><text start="207.78" dur="3.304">you literally don&amp;#39;t see the
crease at all, and screen off,</text><text start="211.084" dur="1.946">you still kind of have to look for it.</text><text start="213.03" dur="0.833">And then, yeah,</text><text start="213.863" dur="1.147">you hit the angle where the light reflects</text><text start="215.01" dur="1.83">off of the middle of the
phone, and then you can see it.</text><text start="216.84" dur="1.62">But this is one of those phones that</text><text start="218.46" dur="1.98">looks really good from almost every angle</text><text start="220.44" dur="1.38">you would actually use it.</text><text start="221.82" dur="1.47">And then it also has one of those hinges</text><text start="223.29" dur="2.544">that stays at whatever
angle that you hold it at.</text><text start="225.834" dur="2.457">So if you want a sort
of a 90 degree angle,</text><text start="228.291" dur="2.679">or a little bit more open
or closed, you can do that.</text><text start="230.97" dur="3.87">And then it has a nice satisfying
spring loaded clap shut.</text><text start="234.84" dur="1.44">It&amp;#39;s also, it&amp;#39;s impressively thin.</text><text start="236.28" dur="2.67">It&amp;#39;s not the thinnest one I&amp;#39;ve
ever seen, but pretty good.</text><text start="238.95" dur="1.5">It&amp;#39;s lighter than you would expect.</text><text start="240.45" dur="1.62">It&amp;#39;s actually, if you put it on a scale,</text><text start="242.07" dur="2.578">it&amp;#39;s basically the exact same
weight as an iPhone 14 Pro</text><text start="244.648" dur="1.652">when they&amp;#39;re doing stainless steel.</text><text start="246.3" dur="1.83">So, just a regular phone weight.</text><text start="248.13" dur="1.14">So it&amp;#39;s an impressive piece of hardware.</text><text start="249.27" dur="3.21">But then the software
for this one is OnePlus.</text><text start="252.48" dur="2.31">So it&amp;#39;s OxygenOS 13.2,</text><text start="254.79" dur="2.85">and it&amp;#39;s got all kinds of little
tweaks and little features</text><text start="257.64" dur="2.1">that power users are gonna love.</text><text start="259.74" dur="3.21">Because let&amp;#39;s face it, this
is a phone for power users.</text><text start="262.95" dur="1.29">People who are gonna love the</text><text start="264.24" dur="2.28">continuity features
between the open screen</text><text start="266.52" dur="0.99">and the closed screen.</text><text start="267.51" dur="1.59">So once you&amp;#39;re done using a big app,</text><text start="269.1" dur="1.35">you just close it like this,</text><text start="270.45" dur="2.37">and then swipe up to pick
up where you left off</text><text start="272.82" dur="1.95">on the outside screen, if you want to.</text><text start="274.77" dur="1.29">Just like the Pixel Fold,</text><text start="276.06" dur="2.76">it&amp;#39;s gonna mirror your home
screen set up automatically</text><text start="278.82" dur="2.16">between the cover screen
and the inside screen.</text><text start="280.98" dur="1.2">So if you change something,</text><text start="282.18" dur="3.21">like move a folder or a
widget or an app on one,</text><text start="285.39" dur="1.2">and then switch to the other,</text><text start="286.59" dur="2.25">it will have also moved from there too.</text><text start="288.84" dur="1.86">Keeps them a little bit more organized.</text><text start="290.7" dur="1.68">I kind of wish I had the
option to change that,</text><text start="292.38" dur="2.19">since this is Android,
and I am a power user.</text><text start="294.57" dur="2.58">But nevertheless, that&amp;#39;s the way it is.</text><text start="297.15" dur="3.09">But then there&amp;#39;s also a ton
of multitasking features</text><text start="300.24" dur="3.39">on the inside screen, for having
multiple apps open at once.</text><text start="303.63" dur="1.92">So you can have, obviously,</text><text start="305.55" dur="1.38">one app open full screen,</text><text start="306.93" dur="1.92">and that looks good for a
surprising number of apps.</text><text start="308.85" dur="2.61">It&amp;#39;ll stretch them if they&amp;#39;re
not natively built for this.</text><text start="311.46" dur="3.24">But then you can have
two apps side by side,</text><text start="314.7" dur="2.97">and then you can pick a
third app to get in the mix.</text><text start="317.67" dur="1.74">Then they&amp;#39;re all just
sort of next to each other</text><text start="319.41" dur="1.83">in this triple panel view,</text><text start="321.24" dur="1.74">and you can move things
between them really quickly.</text><text start="322.98" dur="1.56">Or if you pinch out with four fingers,</text><text start="324.54" dur="3.39">you can see all of the apps at once.</text><text start="327.93" dur="1.65">So between that and the dock,</text><text start="329.58" dur="2.16">with all of your apps and recent files,</text><text start="331.74" dur="2.55">it&amp;#39;s just a very well considered hub for</text><text start="334.29" dur="2.28">sitting down and just getting stuff done.</text><text start="336.57" dur="1.614">Like I feel like when I sit
down and open this phone,</text><text start="338.184" dur="3.066">I&amp;#39;m about to be really
productive and get a lot done.</text><text start="341.25" dur="1.47">This phone, the OnePlus Open,</text><text start="342.72" dur="1.47">honestly, as a phone,</text><text start="344.19" dur="3.63">it nails all five of my
pillars of a great smartphone.</text><text start="347.82" dur="1.44">Great screen, great battery,</text><text start="349.26" dur="1.53">great build, great performance,</text><text start="350.79" dur="2.18">great camera, and I&amp;#39;m not
being generous with that stuff.</text><text start="352.97" dur="2.11">It like, actually nails all of that stuff.</text><text start="355.08" dur="1.38">Like you already heard
about the great screen,</text><text start="356.46" dur="2.01">and the fact that they
match each other so well</text><text start="358.47" dur="2.55">inside and outside, is
already pretty great.</text><text start="361.02" dur="1.68">There&amp;#39;s also great performance.</text><text start="362.7" dur="1.2">Super high-end specs.</text><text start="363.9" dur="4.35">Snapdragon 8 gen 2, 16 gigs of fast RAM,</text><text start="368.25" dur="3.27">512 gigs of UFS 4.0 storage.</text><text start="371.52" dur="2.31">I mean the pair of 120 hertz LTPO displays</text><text start="373.83" dur="2.46">have a 240 hertz touch sample rate.</text><text start="376.29" dur="1.83">It&amp;#39;s super responsive, and I mean,</text><text start="378.12" dur="1.8">the whole thing feels very future-proof.</text><text start="379.92" dur="1.56">And then you also heard
about the build quality,</text><text start="381.48" dur="1.92">which I&amp;#39;ll revisit that in a second.</text><text start="383.4" dur="1.818">But then battery life
has also been excellent,</text><text start="385.218" dur="2.832">with this 4800 MilliAmp hour battery,</text><text start="388.05" dur="3.09">and 67 watt fast charging,</text><text start="391.14" dur="3.57">although it just skips wireless
charging, for some reason,</text><text start="394.71" dur="2.086">which is like the most OnePlus thing ever.</text><text start="396.796" dur="1.994">I think it adds like,</text><text start="398.79" dur="2.58">no cost and no weight and no thickness,</text><text start="401.37" dur="1.05">but yet they leave it out</text><text start="402.42" dur="2.16">when all the other
competitors have it anyway?</text><text start="404.58" dur="0.84">Alright, fine.</text><text start="405.42" dur="2.16">But then this huge
camera module on the back</text><text start="407.58" dur="1.86">kind of implies high end cameras,</text><text start="409.44" dur="2.19">but you can never really be
sure until you test them.</text><text start="411.63" dur="3.09">And sure enough, this
(indistinct) camera setup</text><text start="414.72" dur="1.38">is pretty decent.</text><text start="416.1" dur="2.49">It&amp;#39;s got this new stacked
sensor for the primary sensor,</text><text start="418.59" dur="2.55">a 3x telephoto, and an ultra wide.</text><text start="421.14" dur="2.37">I found it&amp;#39;s pretty good most of the time,</text><text start="423.51" dur="2.34">although it&amp;#39;s not very
good at freezing motion.</text><text start="425.85" dur="2.67">Which is fine if you take
photos of still subjects,</text><text start="428.52" dur="2.43">but the second it&amp;#39;s people or animals,</text><text start="430.95" dur="2.61">and those things start to move,</text><text start="433.56" dur="1.02">then it can be kind of hard</text><text start="434.58" dur="2.25">getting a shutter speed fast
enough to freeze that stuff.</text><text start="436.83" dur="2.43">You basically have to
switch to action mode,</text><text start="439.26" dur="1.2">which there&amp;#39;s a button for.</text><text start="440.46" dur="1.74">And that works by
cranking the shutter speed</text><text start="442.2" dur="0.99">way up, as expected,</text><text start="443.19" dur="2.52">but then ISO starts to get a little high,</text><text start="445.71" dur="1.95">high enough that photos
are now a little noisier,</text><text start="447.66" dur="0.9">a little worse looking,</text><text start="448.56" dur="1.65">so it&amp;#39;s just, that&amp;#39;s unfortunate.</text><text start="450.21" dur="1.83">And by the way, this isn&amp;#39;t
one of the five pillars,</text><text start="452.04" dur="3.9">but I also found that the
microphone on this phone</text><text start="455.94" dur="1.83">is actually quite good.</text><text start="457.77" dur="1.47">They&amp;#39;re usually not this good.</text><text start="459.24" dur="0.93">I was pleasantly surprised.</text><text start="460.17" dur="3">But it all comes together
in a really nice phone</text><text start="463.17" dur="1.5">that I think a lot of
people including myself</text><text start="464.67" dur="1.74">are gonna really like using.</text><text start="466.41" dur="1.62">So the question is,</text><text start="468.03" dur="2.49">why do I think people aren&amp;#39;t buying</text><text start="470.52" dur="2.52">folding phones that much,
if they&amp;#39;re this good?</text><text start="473.04" dur="2.52">It turns out, a phone
can hit all five pillars</text><text start="475.56" dur="0.833">of a great smartphone,</text><text start="476.393" dur="4.027">and not be a great buy
for everyone, necessarily.</text><text start="480.42" dur="1.92">And so it really comes down
to three things, I think.</text><text start="482.34" dur="2.34">Number one is still price.</text><text start="484.68" dur="2.82">Number two is the durability question.</text><text start="487.5" dur="2.85">And then number three is
just the power user problem.</text><text start="490.35" dur="5">So on price, this phone is $1700 US.</text><text start="495.54" dur="1.95">That is a lot of money
to spend on a phone,</text><text start="497.49" dur="1.851">no matter how you chop it
up into monthly segments</text><text start="499.341" dur="1.179">or staggered payments.</text><text start="500.52" dur="0.99">It&amp;#39;s just a lot, right?</text><text start="501.51" dur="2.37">It&amp;#39;s literally twice as
much as an iPhone 15.</text><text start="503.88" dur="0.833">But guess what?</text><text start="504.713" dur="2.02">That&amp;#39;s literally right in line
with its folding competitors,</text><text start="506.733" dur="2.757">like the other two folding
phones available in the US,</text><text start="509.49" dur="2.31">Pixel Fold, $1800.</text><text start="511.8" dur="2.76">Samsung Z Fold 5. $1800.</text><text start="514.56" dur="1.83">So this one&amp;#39;s actually kind of a bargain.</text><text start="516.39" dur="2.19">That&amp;#39;s the most obvious
thing holding these back,</text><text start="518.58" dur="1.77">&amp;#39;cause they&amp;#39;re still so expensive.</text><text start="520.35" dur="0.87">But then number two,</text><text start="521.22" dur="3.75">durability is also questionable at best.</text><text start="524.97" dur="2.82">Now of course, they do all
the testing that they can,</text><text start="527.79" dur="0.9">and guess what?</text><text start="528.69" dur="3.06">They&amp;#39;ve got IPX4 water
resistance, which is nice.</text><text start="531.75" dur="1.35">And they have a durability rating</text><text start="533.1" dur="3.63">for a million folds of the
hinge, and that&amp;#39;s great.</text><text start="536.73" dur="2.13">But then, what about these dead pixels</text><text start="538.86" dur="1.02">that have started appearing</text><text start="539.88" dur="1.68">at the bottom middle of my screen,</text><text start="541.56" dur="1.62">right around the hinge?</text><text start="543.18" dur="2.94">I had this one for three
weeks, and babied it,</text><text start="546.12" dur="2.04">and this is already
starting to show up on mine.</text><text start="548.16" dur="1.53">It doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s
gonna be bad for everyone,</text><text start="549.69" dur="1.62">but that&amp;#39;s not great,</text><text start="551.31" dur="3.15">and I suspect it&amp;#39;s not gonna
happen on non-folding phones.</text><text start="554.46" dur="2.85">But the third and final
reason folding phones,</text><text start="557.31" dur="1.71">as great as they&amp;#39;ve been getting,</text><text start="559.02" dur="3.24">aren&amp;#39;t necessarily translating
to mainstream success,</text><text start="562.26" dur="2.55">is that they&amp;#39;re power user phones.</text><text start="564.81" dur="3.78">They&amp;#39;re, folding and unfolding
is a power user feature.</text><text start="568.59" dur="3.54">And power user features,
as much as we love &amp;#39;em,</text><text start="572.13" dur="1.38">don&amp;#39;t sell a ton of phones.</text><text start="573.51" dur="1.8">We figured this out many times</text><text start="575.31" dur="1.625">when LG spent years and years</text><text start="576.935" dur="2.275">making some of the most
manually adjustable cameras</text><text start="579.21" dur="2.01">in the smartphone world,</text><text start="581.22" dur="1.41">and now they don&amp;#39;t make
smartphones anymore.</text><text start="582.63" dur="1.02">And we still have Sony,</text><text start="583.65" dur="2.1">who can&amp;#39;t stop making professional cameras</text><text start="585.75" dur="1.2">in a smartphone body,</text><text start="586.95" dur="1.86">but their sales are putting them</text><text start="588.81" dur="1.74">in danger of the same thing.</text><text start="590.55" dur="3.63">And Asus ZenFones are
absolutely incredible right now,</text><text start="594.18" dur="1.74">for enthusiasts like myself,</text><text start="595.92" dur="1.92">but they&amp;#39;ve already thrown a head fake.</text><text start="597.84" dur="2.64">Clearly they&amp;#39;re not
doing super well either.</text><text start="600.48" dur="1.26">I&amp;#39;d honestly be willing to bet,</text><text start="601.74" dur="2.37">without even being able to
look into anyone&amp;#39;s books,</text><text start="604.11" dur="4.26">that the folding phones
are not at the top of sales</text><text start="608.37" dur="2.4">in any of the lineups
of any of the companies</text><text start="610.77" dur="0.99">who are making these things.</text><text start="611.76" dur="2.85">Probably the most compelling
folding phone hardware</text><text start="614.61" dur="2.22">I&amp;#39;ve seen yet, is this HONOR phone.</text><text start="616.83" dur="3.48">This thing&amp;#39;s called the HONOR Magic V2.</text><text start="620.31" dur="1.29">Bro, look at this thing!</text><text start="621.6" dur="1.59">This, it&amp;#39;s super thin,</text><text start="623.19" dur="2.55">it has all the right things
in all the right places.</text><text start="625.74" dur="2.164">It&amp;#39;s got a 3D printed
titanium hinge cover,</text><text start="627.904" dur="3.176">barely showing any crease when it&amp;#39;s open.</text><text start="631.08" dur="3.12">Thin bezels, nice screens
all the way around.</text><text start="634.2" dur="3.03">Somehow it has a 5000
MilliAmp hour battery inside,</text><text start="637.23" dur="1.5">and high-end specs.</text><text start="638.73" dur="3.24">Like, playing with this phone
over almost anything else,</text><text start="641.97" dur="1.53">over even Samsung&amp;#39;s,</text><text start="643.5" dur="3.54">has helped me appreciate
what folding phone hardware</text><text start="647.04" dur="1.17">can actually be.</text><text start="648.21" dur="1.38">But despite all that awesomeness,</text><text start="649.59" dur="2.46">it still has those kind
of obvious downsides</text><text start="652.05" dur="1.2">for a regular person,</text><text start="653.25" dur="2.55">to probably not pick it
over a regular phone.</text><text start="655.8" dur="2.37">The price, it&amp;#39;s like 1400 bucks.</text><text start="658.17" dur="0.993">The durability?</text><text start="660.72" dur="1.86">Potentially compromised, we don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="662.58" dur="1.56">And then even though
it is thin and awesome,</text><text start="664.14" dur="1.11">it&amp;#39;s still just like,</text><text start="665.25" dur="2.85">the power user thing of wanting to carry</text><text start="668.1" dur="1.14">a slightly thicker phone around</text><text start="669.24" dur="1.44">and have that extra ability</text><text start="670.68" dur="2.584">is not something everyone sees as obvious</text><text start="673.264" dur="1.856">and something they actually want.</text><text start="675.12" dur="1.38">We are starting to
finally see some of those</text><text start="676.5" dur="3.45">flipping phones come at least
closer to the mainstream,</text><text start="679.95" dur="2.1">because they are lower in price.</text><text start="682.05" dur="3.72">The the Z Flip 5 is down to a
thousand bucks from Samsung.</text><text start="685.77" dur="3.27">And Motorola just launched
their most affordable flip yet,</text><text start="689.04" dur="4.08">the Razr 40, I think is
launching soon at 600 bucks.</text><text start="693.12" dur="2.55">So that seems to be getting
closer, but it&amp;#39;s just,</text><text start="695.67" dur="2.07">we need a lot more of that stuff.</text><text start="697.74" dur="3.75">So, folding phones are simultaneously</text><text start="701.49" dur="4.14">very evolved from their
beginnings just a few years ago,</text><text start="705.63" dur="2.853">and yet still have a long way to go.</text><text start="709.38" dur="3.393">So I guess until we get there,
it&amp;#39;s more fun for us nerds.</text><text start="713.67" dur="1.003">Thanks for watching!</text><text start="714.673" dur="1.547">Catch you in the next one.</text><text start="716.22" dur="1.199">Peace.</text><text start="717.419" dur="3.757">(chill beats and uplifting strings music)</text></transcript>
