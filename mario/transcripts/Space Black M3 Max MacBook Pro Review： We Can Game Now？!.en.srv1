<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.115" dur="2.525">(upbeat music)</text><text start="2.64" dur="2.52">- All right, so there
are two new things about</text><text start="5.16" dur="1.413">this new laptop from Apple.</text><text start="7.62" dur="2.466">The new color and the new chip.</text><text start="10.086" dur="2.754">(upbeat music)</text><text start="12.84" dur="1.38">Everything that was already great about</text><text start="14.22" dur="3.57">the outside of Apple&amp;#39;s laptop
redesign is still great.</text><text start="17.79" dur="1.11">It still has a bunch of ports.</text><text start="18.9" dur="2.4">The full size HDMI, the
MagSafe is still here,</text><text start="21.3" dur="3.086">still has that high quality
build, the boxy design,</text><text start="24.386" dur="1.864">the super bright display.</text><text start="26.25" dur="1.5">Also everything that was awkward about it</text><text start="27.75" dur="1.41">is also still awkward about it.</text><text start="29.16" dur="3.39">Still has this nice big notch
at the top with just a webcam</text><text start="32.55" dur="1.11">and no face unlock.</text><text start="33.66" dur="3.93">But it comes in black now, kind of.</text><text start="37.59" dur="3.09">It looked a lot darker in
Apple&amp;#39;s announcement video.</text><text start="40.68" dur="2.85">Like the color is literally
called Space Black, right?</text><text start="43.53" dur="2.761">So I&amp;#39;m expecting a really,
really black laptop.</text><text start="46.291" dur="1.979">And in the commercial it looks awesome.</text><text start="48.27" dur="2.34">They talk about this fancy
new anodization process</text><text start="50.61" dur="2.31">for the aluminum, so it&amp;#39;s not a coating,</text><text start="52.92" dur="2.64">it&amp;#39;s an actual new chemistry
process that is a part</text><text start="55.56" dur="1.74">of the anodization itself.</text><text start="57.3" dur="2.1">It&amp;#39;s supposed to be extra
fingerprint resistant.</text><text start="59.4" dur="2.785">But now that we actually
have it here, in reality,</text><text start="62.185" dur="3.196">I mean, it&amp;#39;s darker, but like,</text><text start="65.381" dur="2.719">it&amp;#39;s just a little bit darker</text><text start="68.1" dur="3.03">than the other Space Gray from before.</text><text start="71.13" dur="1.44">If you wanna see a black laptop,</text><text start="72.57" dur="1.89">this is a black laptop,</text><text start="74.46" dur="2.07">like they make black laptops already.</text><text start="76.53" dur="3.3">So Apple&amp;#39;s here is just,
it&amp;#39;s a darker gray.</text><text start="79.83" dur="1.62">I think it&amp;#39;s basically the darkest</text><text start="81.45" dur="3.78">that Apple could get without
showing a ton of fingerprints.</text><text start="85.23" dur="1.98">I mean, it still does show
some fingerprints a little bit.</text><text start="87.21" dur="2.28">It&amp;#39;s definitely not completely immune.</text><text start="89.49" dur="2.49">But compared to some other
black laptops I&amp;#39;ve tried,</text><text start="91.98" dur="1.17">it is better than those.</text><text start="93.15" dur="3.21">So it&amp;#39;s somewhere in the middle
of not so many fingerprints,</text><text start="96.36" dur="1.839">but also darker than normal.</text><text start="98.199" dur="3.441">It&amp;#39;s fine, it&amp;#39;s darker, which is nice.</text><text start="101.64" dur="2.52">Like some camera angles it
hits, it really looks dark,</text><text start="104.16" dur="2.01">but you get the idea.</text><text start="106.17" dur="0.833">It also, if you&amp;#39;re curious,</text><text start="107.003" dur="1.687">it also comes with black apple stickers,</text><text start="108.69" dur="2.76">and it also comes with a
black MagSafe charging cable,</text><text start="111.45" dur="2.37">but also, that braided cable
is darker than the end.</text><text start="113.82" dur="3.63">And it also comes with a
brick that&amp;#39;s still white.</text><text start="117.45" dur="1.56">So I wouldn&amp;#39;t say they fully committed</text><text start="119.01" dur="2.16">to the Space Black theme quite yet.</text><text start="121.17" dur="1.83">I&amp;#39;ll give &amp;#39;em partial credit.</text><text start="123" dur="2.91">But then let&amp;#39;s talk about the chip inside.</text><text start="125.91" dur="2.61">So the new three nanometer M3 family</text><text start="128.52" dur="1.2">of chips gets announced</text><text start="129.72" dur="1.29">and it does offer some</text><text start="131.01" dur="2.82">nice improvements over
the M2 family, definitely.</text><text start="133.83" dur="1.56">It almost feels weird to compare it</text><text start="135.39" dur="2.16">to the M2 stuff because almost nobody</text><text start="137.55" dur="2.46">with an M2 should be upgrading to this,</text><text start="140.01" dur="1.62">but at least it&amp;#39;s a
good frame of reference.</text><text start="141.63" dur="2.55">So I&amp;#39;ve been testing
the absolute highest end</text><text start="144.18" dur="2.13">M3 Max in this laptop,</text><text start="146.31" dur="2.58">which from the M2 Max
goes from a 38 core GPU</text><text start="148.89" dur="1.89">to a 40 core GPU.</text><text start="150.78" dur="5">And from 96 gigs of shared
memory to now up to 128 gigs.</text><text start="155.97" dur="3.12">CPU wise, Apple&amp;#39;s claims were about right.</text><text start="159.09" dur="3.3">Somewhere in the 20 sometimes
30% improvement range</text><text start="162.39" dur="1.92">over last year, which is very respectable.</text><text start="164.31" dur="2.46">And actually, it&amp;#39;s a bigger
jump in single core performance</text><text start="166.77" dur="2.25">than I was expecting, which is awesome for</text><text start="169.02" dur="2.04">just the daily use, the quick snappy,</text><text start="171.06" dur="2.64">everyday computing, browsing type stuff.</text><text start="173.7" dur="3.81">And then GPU wise, this is
where more people were hoping</text><text start="177.51" dur="1.5">for a little bit of a bigger improvement.</text><text start="179.01" dur="2.52">And again, it is a respectable bump.</text><text start="181.53" dur="3.03">Not quite leapfrogging
the big discreet GPUs,</text><text start="184.56" dur="3.69">but still putting M3
Max&amp;#39;s GPU up at the level</text><text start="188.25" dur="1.95">of M1 Ultra.</text><text start="190.2" dur="0.93">So that&amp;#39;s pretty impressive.</text><text start="191.13" dur="1.53">And matching somewhere</text><text start="192.66" dur="3.27">around AMD Radeon RX 6800 on benchmarks</text><text start="195.93" dur="3.27">or about an RTX 3070, which is, you know,</text><text start="199.2" dur="1.89">we&amp;#39;re talking a fairly
mid-range card at this point.</text><text start="201.09" dur="3.03">But that&amp;#39;s the thing about
all this new GPU performance</text><text start="204.12" dur="1.5">and the benchmarks and all that is great,</text><text start="205.62" dur="2.67">but what&amp;#39;s actually more
interesting, at least to me,</text><text start="208.29" dur="2.97">is what you&amp;#39;re actually going to do with</text><text start="211.26" dur="2.783">that extra performance,
that extra graphics power.</text><text start="214.043" dur="4.267">And for a laptop like this,
that&amp;#39;s typically games</text><text start="218.31" dur="3.42">or high powered graphics
related applications.</text><text start="221.73" dur="3.18">So yeah, when you see that
powerful new GPU in a laptop</text><text start="224.91" dur="2.34">with new hardware accelerated ray tracing</text><text start="227.25" dur="3.15">for the first time in a
Mac and the mesh shading</text><text start="230.4" dur="3.84">and all that, probably the
first thing you think is gaming.</text><text start="234.24" dur="2.19">But then you realize it&amp;#39;s a Mac.</text><text start="236.43" dur="2.85">So probably not gaming.</text><text start="239.28" dur="1.92">But really I think the
reason, at least in my head,</text><text start="241.2" dur="3.36">that most people don&amp;#39;t
associate gaming with Macs</text><text start="244.56" dur="1.71">is not because they&amp;#39;re not powerful.</text><text start="246.27" dur="1.65">I mean, they&amp;#39;re not as powerful</text><text start="247.92" dur="2.94">as the highest industry
GPUs, but they&amp;#39;re not bad.</text><text start="250.86" dur="2.49">It&amp;#39;s just because the
games that people play</text><text start="253.35" dur="1.8">and are enthusiastic about</text><text start="255.15" dur="2.94">are often not available on the Mac.</text><text start="258.09" dur="1.35">Like, I&amp;#39;m not even a big PC gamer,</text><text start="259.44" dur="2.79">but you already know, if you
want to play &amp;quot;The Witcher,&amp;quot;</text><text start="262.23" dur="3.277">the new &amp;quot;Fallout,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Skyrim,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Crysis,&amp;quot;</text><text start="265.507" dur="2.183">&amp;quot;Apex Legends,&amp;quot; there&amp;#39;s a long list.</text><text start="267.69" dur="2.97">And if you want to throw
maximum GPU power at that game</text><text start="270.66" dur="2.64">to play it in the best possible quality,</text><text start="273.3" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;re looking to optimize
a PC, not buy a Mac.</text><text start="276.72" dur="1.77">So I actually think, and
I think it&amp;#39;s maybe worth</text><text start="278.49" dur="0.93">an entire separate video,</text><text start="279.42" dur="1.14">maybe let me know if you&amp;#39;re interested,</text><text start="280.56" dur="3.21">but I think gaming on
the Mac is in an all time</text><text start="283.77" dur="2.04">interesting place right now,</text><text start="285.81" dur="1.89">because again, lots of games
are not available on the Mac,</text><text start="287.7" dur="2.88">but this is the most powerful
Mac that&amp;#39;s ever been made.</text><text start="290.58" dur="1.53">And I&amp;#39;ve been playing
with some of the games</text><text start="292.11" dur="2.25">that Apple likes to show
off, like in the app store.</text><text start="294.36" dur="2.52">They&amp;#39;re like, &amp;quot;Guys, we have games.</text><text start="296.88" dur="2.04">There&amp;#39;s lots of games
and they&amp;#39;re really good</text><text start="298.92" dur="2.25">and they take advantage of the new stuff.&amp;quot;</text><text start="301.17" dur="2.64">I&amp;#39;ve been playing this
game called &amp;quot;Lies of P.&amp;quot;</text><text start="303.81" dur="1.53">It&amp;#39;s one of the ones they
talked about in the keynote</text><text start="305.34" dur="0.833">and it takes advantage</text><text start="306.173" dur="1.567">of the hardware accelerated ray tracing.</text><text start="307.74" dur="2.67">You can see it in the
reflections and on the floor</text><text start="310.41" dur="1.74">and in the sword and everything.</text><text start="312.15" dur="3.12">It plays amazing. Like it looks great.</text><text start="315.27" dur="3.39">Frame rates stay high. I&amp;#39;m
playing at 4K resolution.</text><text start="318.66" dur="4.41">There&amp;#39;s a visual depth and
detail that&amp;#39;s beautiful.</text><text start="323.07" dur="3.27">Plus, macOS Sonoma has the gaming mode,</text><text start="326.34" dur="3.3">which is allocating as much
power as possible to this game.</text><text start="329.64" dur="1.71">It also lets you use
a Bluetooth controller</text><text start="331.35" dur="2.52">with way faster sampling
and lower latency.</text><text start="333.87" dur="4.17">And so just maxing out
everything works great.</text><text start="338.04" dur="1.92">It&amp;#39;s an awesome playing experience.</text><text start="339.96" dur="1.59">I was very impressed.</text><text start="341.55" dur="3.99">I just don&amp;#39;t care about this game.</text><text start="345.54" dur="3.15">I&amp;#39;m not invested in that
particular game at all.</text><text start="348.69" dur="1.35">It was fun to play the demo,</text><text start="350.04" dur="2.7">and I was impressed with the
actual moment of the computing.</text><text start="352.74" dur="2.43">It would get a little warm
and the fans would spin up,</text><text start="355.17" dur="0.99">but the fact that it would work</text><text start="356.16" dur="1.71">on those Mac settings is amazing.</text><text start="357.87" dur="1.77">I just don&amp;#39;t, I&amp;#39;m not
invested in that game at all.</text><text start="359.64" dur="2.4">And I think that sort of
encapsulates the way I feel</text><text start="362.04" dur="1.89">about all this extra GPU power,</text><text start="363.93" dur="1.871">is like, you could use it for gaming,</text><text start="365.801" dur="3.169">but if you&amp;#39;re gonna buy a
computer for this much money</text><text start="368.97" dur="2.22">to game, you&amp;#39;re not buying a Mac.</text><text start="371.19" dur="3.6">But then again, of course,
this is a Pro laptop,</text><text start="374.79" dur="0.833">it&amp;#39;s a MacBook Pro.</text><text start="375.623" dur="2.557">And so there are lots of other
non-games that take advantage</text><text start="378.18" dur="1.65">of this extra GPU power</text><text start="379.83" dur="2.34">and of this new hardware
accelerated ray tracing</text><text start="382.17" dur="1.53">and the mesh shading and all of that.</text><text start="383.7" dur="2.64">Things like Cinema 4D and this laptop</text><text start="386.34" dur="3.12">with this chip is better than
ever at all that stuff too.</text><text start="389.46" dur="1.56">And I think we&amp;#39;re actually
gonna slowly start seeing</text><text start="391.02" dur="1.89">even more apps on the Mac take advantage</text><text start="392.91" dur="1.74">of this stuff as time goes on.</text><text start="394.65" dur="4.2">But my conclusion was, okay,
look, when the event happened,</text><text start="398.85" dur="2.49">I watched it and that
last video you can see in</text><text start="401.34" dur="2.13">that hotel room, and I
was very excited about it.</text><text start="403.47" dur="2.13">It got announced, I saw
a new matte black MacBook</text><text start="405.6" dur="1.95">with a new chip, and I thought that</text><text start="407.55" dur="3.84">that new color on top of that new chip</text><text start="411.39" dur="2.34">would be enough for me to go,
&amp;quot;All right, you know what?</text><text start="413.73" dur="2.28">It&amp;#39;s finally time, I&amp;#39;m gonna upgrade.&amp;quot;</text><text start="416.01" dur="2.58">So I did, I clicked the order button</text><text start="418.59" dur="2.97">and I purchased a new maxed out</text><text start="421.56" dur="2.82">M3 Max MacBook Pro in matte black.</text><text start="424.38" dur="1.89">But now that I&amp;#39;ve actually
had this review unit here,</text><text start="426.27" dur="2.61">and I&amp;#39;ve gone through my
testing and I&amp;#39;ve experienced it,</text><text start="428.88" dur="2.73">the color is kind of nice,</text><text start="431.61" dur="2.22">but it&amp;#39;s not quite as impressive</text><text start="433.83" dur="2.13">and new as I was maybe hoping.</text><text start="435.96" dur="2.25">And then the new chip,
it&amp;#39;s great and everything,</text><text start="438.21" dur="2.01">but it&amp;#39;s not actually going</text><text start="440.22" dur="2.76">to make a meaningful
difference to my workflow.</text><text start="442.98" dur="2.97">With a couple of videos I
edit on the go on my laptop</text><text start="445.95" dur="3.243">from the M1 Max laptop
that I&amp;#39;ve been using.</text><text start="450.66" dur="1.83">So I canceled.</text><text start="452.49" dur="2.1">I logged in and I canceled my order</text><text start="454.59" dur="4.17">and I will continue to daily
what I have for the past,</text><text start="458.76" dur="1.59">I guess, three years now,</text><text start="460.35" dur="2.37">with the M1 Max 16 inch MacBook Pro.</text><text start="462.72" dur="1.05">Turns out it&amp;#39;s not for me.</text><text start="463.77" dur="2.25">Well, I mean, I guess it is a
high-end matte black laptop.</text><text start="466.02" dur="1.2">So maybe it is kind of for me.</text><text start="467.22" dur="1.05">But I think the point I&amp;#39;m trying</text><text start="468.27" dur="4.5">to make is if you already
have an M family chip MacBook</text><text start="472.77" dur="2.16">in the tier that you want,</text><text start="474.93" dur="2.64">meaning if you have an
M2 Pro or an M1 Pro,</text><text start="477.57" dur="2.31">M3 Pro is not gonna be the
huge difference for you.</text><text start="479.88" dur="3">If you have M2 Max or M1 Max,</text><text start="482.88" dur="2.64">M3 Max is not really for you.</text><text start="485.52" dur="2.52">This is like any other spec bump</text><text start="488.04" dur="2.55">far more for people with older machines.</text><text start="490.59" dur="1.14">You didn&amp;#39;t need to hear me say this,</text><text start="491.73" dur="1.68">but it&amp;#39;s true for people
with older machines,</text><text start="493.41" dur="1.62">with Intel machines,</text><text start="495.03" dur="2.19">or with machines in a different tier,</text><text start="497.22" dur="2.4">where this would really
unlock something new</text><text start="499.62" dur="1.68">in their workflow.</text><text start="501.3" dur="0.9">And that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s great about &amp;#39;em,</text><text start="502.2" dur="2.19">is you&amp;#39;re gonna get a
better machine than ever.</text><text start="504.39" dur="1.77">For me, I&amp;#39;m gonna keep using M1 Max.</text><text start="506.16" dur="2.46">That&amp;#39;s a testament to
how good that thing is.</text><text start="508.62" dur="1.95">Maybe I&amp;#39;ll do a two years later,</text><text start="510.57" dur="2.01">three years later review
or something like that.</text><text start="512.58" dur="4.02">But for now, I&amp;#39;m glad there&amp;#39;s
a new darker color available.</text><text start="516.6" dur="2.7">But yeah, you know,
it&amp;#39;s weirdly not for me.</text><text start="519.3" dur="2.04">Still a great laptop,
still great displays,</text><text start="521.34" dur="2.49">amazing speakers, awesome build quality,</text><text start="523.83" dur="1.74">battery life&amp;#39;s still awesome.</text><text start="525.57" dur="2.43">But maybe my upgrade will come when</text><text start="528" dur="2.76">they really commit to
the matte black thing</text><text start="530.76" dur="2.883">or there&amp;#39;s another huge upgrade
somewhere down the line.</text></transcript>
