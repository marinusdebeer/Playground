<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.33" dur="3.502">- All right, so Apple&amp;#39;s
Wonderlust event happened.</text><text start="3.832" dur="1.088">It was pretty interesting.</text><text start="4.92" dur="2.61">Honestly, not that much
stuff actually got announced.</text><text start="7.53" dur="4.2">I mean, we knew it was gonna
be iPhone, Apple Watch, USB-C,</text><text start="11.73" dur="1.29">not that much other stuff.</text><text start="13.02" dur="1.86">But it was more the stuff
in between the lines</text><text start="14.88" dur="0.96">that was kind of interesting</text><text start="15.84" dur="1.56">and some other random stuff</text><text start="17.4" dur="2.16">that I don&amp;#39;t think a lot of
people are talking about.</text><text start="19.56" dur="0.833">So let&amp;#39;s talk about it.</text><text start="20.393" dur="0.907">Now, first of all, I gotta say,</text><text start="21.3" dur="2.67">it was a complete surprise to me</text><text start="23.97" dur="1.29">when one of the first things that they did</text><text start="25.26" dur="1.68">was quote my MacBook Air review.</text><text start="26.94" dur="1.62">So you know, like, the
beginning of the keynotes</text><text start="28.56" dur="0.833">they usually do</text><text start="29.393" dur="1.147">where they sort of recap a bunch of stuff</text><text start="30.54" dur="1.32">that&amp;#39;s previously happened?</text><text start="31.86" dur="2.34">One of the things they did was
talk about the MacBook Air,</text><text start="34.2" dur="0.87">and this happened.</text><text start="35.07" dur="3.39">- And Marques Brownlee said,
&amp;quot;The 15-inch MacBook Air</text><text start="38.46" dur="3.12">is going to instantly rocket
to the top of the lineup</text><text start="41.58" dur="3.84">to become the most
popular 15-inch laptop.&amp;quot;</text><text start="45.42" dur="3.783">We love the new MacBook Air
and the entire Mac lineup.</text><text start="50.67" dur="3.06">- And that was pretty cool.</text><text start="53.73" dur="1.62">I gotta say, they didn&amp;#39;t tell
me they were gonna do that.</text><text start="55.35" dur="2.52">They didn&amp;#39;t ask. They didn&amp;#39;t pay for it.</text><text start="57.87" dur="1.92">They just kind of did it.</text><text start="59.79" dur="1.92">So shout-out to Tim.</text><text start="61.71" dur="2.25">I guess in this case, it&amp;#39;s totally fine.</text><text start="63.96" dur="1.53">I guess there&amp;#39;s just an
element of pride knowing</text><text start="65.49" dur="2.13">that, like, it&amp;#39;s come a long
way since the beginning.</text><text start="67.62" dur="2.28">I remember like 6, 7, 8 years ago</text><text start="69.9" dur="3.09">when there was zero YouTubers
at any of these events,</text><text start="72.99" dur="1.68">and then there was one</text><text start="74.67" dur="1.38">and then there were three or four</text><text start="76.05" dur="1.68">and then there were 12 or 13</text><text start="77.73" dur="2.37">and just now we&amp;#39;re all
just a part of the media,</text><text start="80.1" dur="1.41">independent creators doing our thing.</text><text start="81.51" dur="2.79">So I feel like it&amp;#39;s kind of a cool moment</text><text start="84.3" dur="1.56">to see that come full circle.</text><text start="85.86" dur="0.833">But anyway, after that,</text><text start="86.693" dur="1.447">they just got right
into the announcements,</text><text start="88.14" dur="2.73">the flagship of which
being the new iPhone.</text><text start="90.87" dur="2.43">So I made an entire separate
video on the iPhones,</text><text start="93.3" dur="2.52">my first hands-on and impressions
of all the little details</text><text start="95.82" dur="1.77">and my first thoughts of everything.</text><text start="97.59" dur="1.26">So I&amp;#39;ll link that below the Like button</text><text start="98.85" dur="1.56">if you wanna check it
out if you&amp;#39;re interested.</text><text start="100.41" dur="2.13">But I&amp;#39;ll just do a brief
summary here for you.</text><text start="102.54" dur="3.03">So the iPhone 15 gets the A16 Bionic chip</text><text start="105.57" dur="1.8">from last year&amp;#39;s iPhone Pro.</text><text start="107.37" dur="2.82">It gets the Dynamic Island, of
course, from the Pro as well.</text><text start="110.19" dur="2.7">Some new colors and a
slightly updated design</text><text start="112.89" dur="2.94">with little better curve radiuses, radii,</text><text start="115.83" dur="1.95">a slightly nicer feel in the hand,</text><text start="117.78" dur="4.2">and a satin soft-touch
back and a slow USB-C port.</text><text start="121.98" dur="2.64">Same starting price and
screen sizes as last year,</text><text start="124.62" dur="1.5">799 for the iPhone 15</text><text start="126.12" dur="2.52">and 899 for the iPhone 15 Plus.</text><text start="128.64" dur="2.16">So then the iPhone 15 Pro gets</text><text start="130.8" dur="2.49">a new three-nanometer A17 Pro chip.</text><text start="133.29" dur="2.25">There&amp;#39;s these new brushed
lighter titanium rails</text><text start="135.54" dur="1.53">to replace the stainless steel,</text><text start="137.07" dur="1.95">a faster USB-C port,</text><text start="139.02" dur="2.31">a customizable action button on the side</text><text start="141.33" dur="1.74">to replace the mute switch,</text><text start="143.07" dur="1.32">a new set of cameras,</text><text start="144.39" dur="4.65">and just the 15 Pro Max gets
a new 5x telephoto camera.</text><text start="149.04" dur="1.62">And the prices are kind of sneaky.</text><text start="150.66" dur="2.97">So it&amp;#39;s still 999 for the 15 Pro</text><text start="153.63" dur="3.24">but the Pro Max now starts at 1,199</text><text start="156.87" dur="2.52">because it&amp;#39;s also starting at 256 gigs.</text><text start="159.39" dur="0.833">There&amp;#39;s a lot more details</text><text start="160.223" dur="1.417">and interesting stuff about the iPhone</text><text start="161.64" dur="0.99">in that hands-on video,</text><text start="162.63" dur="1.05">so you know where to find that.</text><text start="163.68" dur="4.14">But then there&amp;#39;s the
other stuff of this event.</text><text start="167.82" dur="2.04">Also, I thought it would
be cool to shoot here</text><text start="169.86" dur="0.833">since this is part</text><text start="170.693" dur="2.287">of where they shot some
scenes in the keynote,</text><text start="172.98" dur="1.98">but now I&amp;#39;m realizing
that it&amp;#39;s a real place.</text><text start="174.96" dur="1.59">There&amp;#39;s like chainsaws in the background.</text><text start="176.55" dur="1.23">So sorry about the noise.</text><text start="177.78" dur="2.91">Anyway, we&amp;#39;ve got Apple
Watch stuff, right?</text><text start="180.69" dur="4.29">So Series 9 and Ultra 2.</text><text start="184.98" dur="0.99">And one of the most interesting things</text><text start="185.97" dur="2.1">about these new watches</text><text start="188.07" dur="2.37">is that visually, just looking at them,</text><text start="190.44" dur="2.01">there&amp;#39;s almost no way to actually tell</text><text start="192.45" dur="1.2">that you&amp;#39;re looking at the new watch.</text><text start="193.65" dur="1.2">It&amp;#39;s very unlike Apple.</text><text start="194.85" dur="2.04">So I think there&amp;#39;s a new
pink color with the Series 9,</text><text start="196.89" dur="2.82">but other than that, it looks
identical to the Series 8</text><text start="199.71" dur="2.37">and the Ultra 2 looks
identical to the Ultra.</text><text start="202.08" dur="2.73">But instead, under the hood,
there&amp;#39;s a big process update</text><text start="204.81" dur="1.98">to this new S9 system on a chip,</text><text start="206.79" dur="2.19">which is more powerful and more efficient,</text><text start="208.98" dur="1.95">and that&amp;#39;s allowing
them to push the watches</text><text start="210.93" dur="2.22">to a higher max brightness</text><text start="213.15" dur="1.83">while keeping the same
quoted battery life.</text><text start="214.98" dur="1.14">So the Series 9 is gonna get</text><text start="216.12" dur="2.46">up to 2,000 nits max brightness now</text><text start="218.58" dur="2.58">and the Ultra 2 is up to 3,000 nits,</text><text start="221.16" dur="2.67">which is actually now, it&amp;#39;s
the brightest display ever</text><text start="223.83" dur="0.96">on any Apple product.</text><text start="224.79" dur="2.43">And they&amp;#39;ve also moved all
Siri requests on the watch now</text><text start="227.22" dur="1.29">to stay on device</text><text start="228.51" dur="2.969">instead of always having to do
a round trip to the internet,</text><text start="231.479" dur="1.621">which I think could help,</text><text start="233.1" dur="1.59">&amp;#39;cause there&amp;#39;s a lot of instances of Siri</text><text start="234.69" dur="3.3">where you, like, ask it,
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the time in Cupertino?&amp;quot;</text><text start="237.99" dur="2.46">And it goes, &amp;quot;Hold on a second.</text><text start="240.45" dur="2.34">Wait for it. I&amp;#39;m thinking about it.</text><text start="242.79" dur="0.833">I don&amp;#39;t know yet,&amp;quot;</text><text start="243.623" dur="1.597">and it&amp;#39;s just frustrating
and it doesn&amp;#39;t work.</text><text start="245.22" dur="2.28">So that should be faster
and more efficient.</text><text start="247.5" dur="1.71">It doesn&amp;#39;t mean Siri&amp;#39;s gonna be good.</text><text start="249.21" dur="3.3">It just means it&amp;#39;ll be bad but faster.</text><text start="252.51" dur="2.37">But then there&amp;#39;s also a
new Ultra Wideband chip</text><text start="254.88" dur="1.53">that can talk to the iPhones</text><text start="256.41" dur="3.03">to make Find My iPhone way more precise</text><text start="259.44" dur="1.74">and actually point out a direction</text><text start="261.18" dur="1.08">to help you find your phone</text><text start="262.26" dur="1.41">instead of just playing a sound.</text><text start="263.67" dur="2.25">I think that&amp;#39;s gonna be super
useful for a lot of people.</text><text start="265.92" dur="2.79">But the most sneaky, interesting
update here to the watch</text><text start="268.71" dur="2.367">is this new double tap gesture.</text><text start="271.077" dur="2.913">So, so, okay, you&amp;#39;ve got the new watch on</text><text start="273.99" dur="2.1">and, basically, it&amp;#39;s always able to detect</text><text start="276.09" dur="1.92">if you do this double tap</text><text start="278.01" dur="2.28">of your thumb and your
index finger together.</text><text start="280.29" dur="2.61">And so I got to try it a
bunch of times at the event</text><text start="282.9" dur="2.16">with a demo watch in the hands-on area.</text><text start="285.06" dur="2.55">It actually seemed very accurate.</text><text start="287.61" dur="1.71">Like, you basically, you raise it to wake,</text><text start="289.32" dur="1.02">give it a split second,</text><text start="290.34" dur="3.54">and then double tap to
press the primary button</text><text start="293.88" dur="1.44">of whatever app you&amp;#39;re in</text><text start="295.32" dur="1.59">that&amp;#39;s on your screen at the moment.</text><text start="296.91" dur="2.73">So it can accept or reject
an incoming phone call</text><text start="299.64" dur="1.53">or stop a timer</text><text start="301.17" dur="2.1">or scroll through the
Smart Stack of widgets</text><text start="303.27" dur="1.53">on the watch face.</text><text start="304.8" dur="2.91">And yeah, it was working really
well for me very quickly.</text><text start="307.71" dur="3.99">This would clearly be super
helpful if my other hand is busy</text><text start="311.7" dur="1.14">or I&amp;#39;m holding something</text><text start="312.84" dur="1.83">or I just wanna quickly do something.</text><text start="314.67" dur="2.1">Ordinarily, honestly, I
would be trying to do that</text><text start="316.77" dur="0.833">with my nose.</text><text start="317.603" dur="1.537">So this is much better.</text><text start="319.14" dur="1.71">Now, the reason I say this is sneaky</text><text start="320.85" dur="1.05">is because I don&amp;#39;t know if you remember,</text><text start="321.9" dur="2.46">just a few weeks ago or months ago,</text><text start="324.36" dur="3.51">this is the same gesture
used to select things</text><text start="327.87" dur="2.34">while you&amp;#39;re wearing Apple Vision Pro.</text><text start="330.21" dur="3.42">In the VR headset, selecting
things is like this.</text><text start="333.63" dur="4.23">And so now on the watch,
selecting things is like that.</text><text start="337.86" dur="2.22">Now, some of you have already
pointed out on Twitter</text><text start="340.08" dur="3.21">this isn&amp;#39;t exactly new completely.</text><text start="343.29" dur="1.77">If you&amp;#39;ve ever dug through
the accessibility settings</text><text start="345.06" dur="0.833">on the Apple Watch before,</text><text start="345.893" dur="1.657">you&amp;#39;ve probably found by
a slightly different name</text><text start="347.55" dur="2.13">basically the exact same feature</text><text start="349.68" dur="1.74">and you&amp;#39;ve been able to double tap</text><text start="351.42" dur="1.412">and do all kinds of other things.</text><text start="352.832" dur="3.568">Now, why isn&amp;#39;t this new double tap</text><text start="356.4" dur="2.52">to select primary stuff feature</text><text start="358.92" dur="1.38">coming to other Apple watches,</text><text start="360.3" dur="1.59">you might be asking.</text><text start="361.89" dur="3.84">Apple says that basically this
new S9 chip is much faster</text><text start="365.73" dur="2.31">at processing all the info
from all those sensors</text><text start="368.04" dur="2.16">and so you&amp;#39;ll be able
to do it more readily.</text><text start="370.2" dur="1.92">And so that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s only coming</text><text start="372.12" dur="2.703">to the new S9-powered Apple watches.</text><text start="375.69" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s convenient.</text><text start="376.523" dur="1.117">But let&amp;#39;s talk about AirPods real quick</text><text start="377.64" dur="3.51">because this might actually
be the ultimate sneaky update.</text><text start="381.15" dur="3.12">So the fact is these
barely even got mentioned</text><text start="384.27" dur="1.11">during the keynote, right?</text><text start="385.38" dur="1.2">Like, they just casually dropped</text><text start="386.58" dur="3">that there would be a new USB-C
case for the AirPods Pro 2</text><text start="389.58" dur="1.5">in, like, one fleeting slide</text><text start="391.08" dur="1.29">and that was basically it.</text><text start="392.37" dur="0.9">So you could be led to believe</text><text start="393.27" dur="2.22">that there&amp;#39;s just nothing new
with the AirPods themselves</text><text start="395.49" dur="1.95">and they&amp;#39;re exactly the same.</text><text start="397.44" dur="0.833">But you&amp;#39;d be wrong.</text><text start="398.273" dur="2.497">So basically, for all
intents and purposes,</text><text start="400.77" dur="4.26">AirPods Pro 2 with the wireless
charging Lightning case</text><text start="405.03" dur="3.36">and AirPods Pro 2 with the
wireless charging USB-C case</text><text start="408.39" dur="2.79">are the same product with a different port</text><text start="411.18" dur="3.33">unless you have Apple Vision Pro,</text><text start="414.51" dur="4.2">in which case, the USB-C
version will be capable</text><text start="418.71" dur="3.39">of doing lossless audio with low latency</text><text start="422.1" dur="1.29">with this new codec</text><text start="423.39" dur="1.98">that Apple has created
just for this purpose,</text><text start="425.37" dur="2.61">this awesome immersive experience.</text><text start="427.98" dur="1.98">So if you don&amp;#39;t have Apple Vision Pro,</text><text start="429.96" dur="1.56">then they&amp;#39;re basically the same product</text><text start="431.52" dur="1.29">with two different ports,</text><text start="432.81" dur="4.95">but there is actually new
hardware and new architecture</text><text start="437.76" dur="3.15">to make this feature possible
with the new USB-C version.</text><text start="440.91" dur="1.5">I don&amp;#39;t think they wanna
talk about that too much</text><text start="442.41" dur="1.71">to not make people who
just bought them last week</text><text start="444.12" dur="0.87">feel too bad about it,</text><text start="444.99" dur="1.98">but they&amp;#39;re actually different headphones.</text><text start="446.97" dur="1.26">So that&amp;#39;s a sneaky update right there</text><text start="448.23" dur="0.96">from Apple behind the scenes</text><text start="449.19" dur="1.935">on one of their most popular products.</text><text start="451.125" dur="1.365">But that&amp;#39;s a good transition</text><text start="452.49" dur="3.24">just to get to the last
seemingly big pillar</text><text start="455.73" dur="0.9">of this announcement,</text><text start="456.63" dur="3.24">which was carbon neutrality
and the environment.</text><text start="459.87" dur="2.52">So Apple couldn&amp;#39;t stop
talking about the environment</text><text start="462.39" dur="1.05">throughout this keynote,</text><text start="463.44" dur="3.93">including one huge overly
self-congratulatory,</text><text start="467.37" dur="1.41">like, 10-minute skit</text><text start="468.78" dur="1.53">in the middle of the keynote video</text><text start="470.31" dur="3.57">with Tim Cook and Apple employees
talking to Mother Nature</text><text start="473.88" dur="1.56">about how much progress they&amp;#39;ve made</text><text start="475.44" dur="2.56">with their products environmentally.</text><text start="478" dur="2.21">I just basically want to
dig more into this later.</text><text start="480.21" dur="1.47">I would say I&amp;#39;m not an expert on this,</text><text start="481.68" dur="3.09">so there&amp;#39;s no way that I
can fully appreciate now</text><text start="484.77" dur="1.77">and fully understand now
everything that was said.</text><text start="486.54" dur="2.07">There&amp;#39;s a lot of specific language used.</text><text start="488.61" dur="1.17">Some of it is very clear,</text><text start="489.78" dur="2.67">like just straight up not
using any leather anymore</text><text start="492.45" dur="2.34">in any Apple products,</text><text start="494.79" dur="2.82">using recycled materials
instead of new virgin materials,</text><text start="497.61" dur="0.833">things like that,</text><text start="498.443" dur="1.717">having more sustainable energy sources.</text><text start="500.16" dur="1.32">But then there&amp;#39;s other things that they,</text><text start="501.48" dur="1.32">I mean, there was a lot.</text><text start="502.8" dur="1.14">There was a lot going on</text><text start="503.94" dur="1.95">and some of it is not quite as simple.</text><text start="505.89" dur="3.48">But they have clearly made
a lot of progress and change</text><text start="509.37" dur="1.38">and they eventually landed on this moment</text><text start="510.75" dur="2.01">where they were like, &amp;quot;The
Apple Watch is the first</text><text start="512.76" dur="1.29">fully carbon neutral product</text><text start="514.05" dur="1.65">that Apple&amp;#39;s actually shipping,&amp;quot;</text><text start="515.7" dur="2.85">on their way to ideally
being fully carbon neutral</text><text start="518.55" dur="2.1">as a company by 2030.</text><text start="520.65" dur="2.04">And so there&amp;#39;s a lot of progress</text><text start="522.69" dur="1.05">that they still need to make.</text><text start="523.74" dur="1.02">And as much as we&amp;#39;ve talked</text><text start="524.76" dur="2.67">about how much Apple still needs to do,</text><text start="527.43" dur="2.52">I kind of feel like I
can&amp;#39;t get mad at this.</text><text start="529.95" dur="1.14">Like, you know what it feels like,</text><text start="531.09" dur="1.92">you ever see those like YouTube videos</text><text start="533.01" dur="2.7">where a YouTuber on the
street, they&amp;#39;ll be micd up</text><text start="535.71" dur="1.53">and they&amp;#39;ll, like, give a homeless person</text><text start="537.24" dur="1.68">a hundred bucks or something</text><text start="538.92" dur="2.04">and half the comments
are like, &amp;quot;Oh, come on,</text><text start="540.96" dur="2.67">you clearly didn&amp;#39;t have
to do it on camera.</text><text start="543.63" dur="1.56">Like, if you really cared,</text><text start="545.19" dur="2.88">then you would do it not on camera.&amp;quot;</text><text start="548.07" dur="2.19">And that&amp;#39;s probably all mostly true,</text><text start="550.26" dur="2.79">but also, that person in need</text><text start="553.05" dur="1.83">still did just get a hundred bucks.</text><text start="554.88" dur="3.48">So it&amp;#39;s like some net
positive was still done.</text><text start="558.36" dur="1.35">And this kind of feels the same way to me.</text><text start="559.71" dur="4.08">Like, okay, Apple is actually
doing a bunch of stuff</text><text start="563.79" dur="1.44">to use recycled materials</text><text start="565.23" dur="2.46">and to make less of an
impact on the environment</text><text start="567.69" dur="1.95">and then they&amp;#39;re doing a
big song and dance about it</text><text start="569.64" dur="1.74">so everyone can see it,</text><text start="571.38" dur="2.25">so that everyone sees it.</text><text start="573.63" dur="2.55">And so you&amp;#39;d say, &amp;quot;Okay,
if they really cared,</text><text start="576.18" dur="1.32">they would do a whole bunch more stuff.&amp;quot;</text><text start="577.5" dur="1.89">And that&amp;#39;s still true,</text><text start="579.39" dur="1.47">but I can&amp;#39;t get mad at the improvements</text><text start="580.86" dur="2.01">that they are actually making.</text><text start="582.87" dur="0.99">Hopefully that makes sense.</text><text start="583.86" dur="1.77">Either way, like I
said, I&amp;#39;m not an expert.</text><text start="585.63" dur="1.2">I wanna dig more into this.</text><text start="586.83" dur="0.9">I wanna talk to some people</text><text start="587.73" dur="2.28">who actually are experts
on it who can help me out</text><text start="590.01" dur="2.4">and maybe that&amp;#39;s a future
topic for another video.</text><text start="592.41" dur="2.49">But that&amp;#39;s just my thoughts and reactions</text><text start="594.9" dur="4.17">from the Wonderlust event of 2023.</text><text start="599.07" dur="1.05">Let me know what your thoughts are below.</text><text start="600.12" dur="1.08">There&amp;#39;s a lot to talk about</text><text start="601.2" dur="1.86">and a lot of random, sneaky stuff</text><text start="603.06" dur="2.94">and the comments section is
always open to talk about it.</text><text start="606" dur="1.44">And techtember rolls on.</text><text start="607.44" dur="0.84">So stick with us.</text><text start="608.28" dur="0.99">Subscribe if you haven&amp;#39;t already.</text><text start="609.27" dur="1.62">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="610.89" dur="1.4">Catch you guys later.
