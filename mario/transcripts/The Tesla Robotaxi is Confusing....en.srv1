<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="2.91">(gentle music)</text><text start="2.91" dur="4.14">- Okay, so the Tesla
Robtaxi unveiling event was</text><text start="7.05" dur="2.58">a couple days ago and it might be</text><text start="9.63" dur="4.653">the weirdest tech event I&amp;#39;ve ever been to.</text><text start="15.15" dur="2.13">You might have seen some
clips from it at this point.</text><text start="17.28" dur="3.66">I was there, I rode in
the self-driving Robotaxi.</text><text start="20.94" dur="3.57">I explored the insane looking Robovan</text><text start="24.51" dur="2.55">and I talked to the Optimus robot</text><text start="27.06" dur="2.291">and then I left feeling kind of confused.</text><text start="29.351" dur="1.759">It was a weird event.</text><text start="31.11" dur="2.82">So here are the three
main big reasons why.</text><text start="33.93" dur="3.27">So first of all, the robo
cab, this was the main thing</text><text start="37.2" dur="3.48">that we knew we were going
to see, this full unveiling</text><text start="40.68" dur="2.52">of a fully self-driving Tesla.</text><text start="43.2" dur="2.43">And we saw it and it looked like this,</text><text start="45.63" dur="3.72">very, very much like a mini Cybertruck.</text><text start="49.35" dur="2.01">Like you&amp;#39;ve got the
light bar on the front,</text><text start="51.36" dur="1.44">the light bar on the back,</text><text start="52.8" dur="2.49">the complete lack of rear visibility.</text><text start="55.29" dur="2.28">Then, of course you can
see it&amp;#39;s a two-door,</text><text start="57.57" dur="2.04">two seater passenger car.</text><text start="59.61" dur="1.11">People were wondering like what</text><text start="60.72" dur="3.36">a full self-driving
robo cab or cyber taxi,</text><text start="64.08" dur="2.1">whatever we&amp;#39;re calling it
would actually look like</text><text start="66.18" dur="1.44">whether it&amp;#39;d look dramatically different</text><text start="67.62" dur="3.12">from a normal car like a
Model 3 or even a Waymo.</text><text start="70.74" dur="2.4">And there are some things that
are significantly different</text><text start="73.14" dur="1.2">about this thing they rolled out.</text><text start="74.34" dur="3.03">I mean on the outside it&amp;#39;s light gold.</text><text start="77.37" dur="2.91">Every single one is this
like silvery gold color,</text><text start="80.28" dur="2.58">although there was never any
mention of actual materials.</text><text start="82.86" dur="2.22">Pretty small footprint,
you can see there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="85.08" dur="3.33">no exterior door handles, or
mirrors, or anything like that.</text><text start="88.41" dur="3.21">And then, since they don&amp;#39;t
need any steering wheel</text><text start="91.62" dur="2.61">or pedals, they can sort of push</text><text start="94.23" dur="2.13">the seating position way
back into this more like</text><text start="96.36" dur="2.67">loungey seating position kind
of near the middle of the car</text><text start="99.03" dur="1.86">there&amp;#39;s a center armrest and there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="100.89" dur="3.18">a massive 21 inch
touchscreen in the center.</text><text start="104.07" dur="3.69">And yes, the doors go up
as if Tesla hasn&amp;#39;t learned</text><text start="107.76" dur="1.92">from their lessons of the Model X,</text><text start="109.68" dur="1.95">they&amp;#39;re making another crazy set of doors</text><text start="111.63" dur="2.61">which, honestly, is
definitely a hit visually.</text><text start="114.24" dur="4.56">It&amp;#39;s a striking feature of
this car alongside the wheels</text><text start="118.8" dur="4.08">which, at first, just look
like these huge gold discs.</text><text start="122.88" dur="2.1">But then, when you take a closer look,</text><text start="124.98" dur="2.46">they&amp;#39;re actually just normal 21 inch</text><text start="127.44" dur="2.01">low rolling resistance continental tires.</text><text start="129.45" dur="3.96">But they&amp;#39;ve painted half
of the sidewall gold</text><text start="133.41" dur="1.98">to match the caps in the middle.</text><text start="135.39" dur="3.45">So it makes it look like a
super thin low profile tire</text><text start="138.84" dur="4.35">with a huge wheel, but
it&amp;#39;s not, it&amp;#39;s just paint.</text><text start="143.19" dur="2.19">But either way, no idea how
much of this is gonna make it</text><text start="145.38" dur="1.92">to any sort of final production.</text><text start="147.3" dur="1.62">But after waiting in line for a bit,</text><text start="148.92" dur="3.78">I got to ride in this
thing for a few minutes.</text><text start="152.7" dur="4.23">So I got in, the screen told
me to buckle my seatbelt,</text><text start="156.93" dur="3.81">and once I did, the door
automatically closed, pretty smart.</text><text start="160.74" dur="1.785">Then I just selected the destination,</text><text start="162.525" dur="2.415">which was on this screen along this route,</text><text start="164.94" dur="1.83">which I assume was pre-mapped.</text><text start="166.77" dur="4.38">And then it just started
rolling, just started going.</text><text start="171.15" dur="3.3">Now, I&amp;#39;ve been in a
self-driving Tesla before,</text><text start="174.45" dur="2.01">but this one is just a
little bit more nervy</text><text start="176.46" dur="2.07">since there&amp;#39;s people everywhere</text><text start="178.53" dur="2.16">and there&amp;#39;s no steering
wheel in front of me.</text><text start="180.69" dur="1.29">But once you get over the eeriness</text><text start="181.98" dur="2.64">of basically being trapped
in this driverless car</text><text start="184.62" dur="2.55">with no manual override,
I started looking around</text><text start="187.17" dur="1.59">and noticing a few other things.</text><text start="188.76" dur="1.65">You know, you sit pretty low to the road,</text><text start="190.41" dur="2.28">similar to a Model 3,
but with more leg room</text><text start="192.69" dur="2.13">since the seating position&amp;#39;s further back.</text><text start="194.82" dur="3.81">And then, there&amp;#39;s even
fewer physical controls</text><text start="198.63" dur="2.01">than ever before in this car.</text><text start="200.64" dur="2.16">Like I basically only found
that the window switches were</text><text start="202.8" dur="1.8">in the middle next to the cup holders.</text><text start="204.6" dur="2.58">I didn&amp;#39;t even see any door latches.</text><text start="207.18" dur="2.67">Like the doors only opened with a button</text><text start="209.85" dur="1.77">on this enormous touch screen.</text><text start="211.62" dur="2.79">So again, like a Tesla, it&amp;#39;s
gonna control everything</text><text start="214.41" dur="4.92">in the car on the screen
including just watching movies</text><text start="219.33" dur="1.98">while the car is driving because why not?</text><text start="221.31" dur="1.95">So you can watch the entire trip</text><text start="223.26" dur="1.95">that I took uncut on
the auto-focus channel</text><text start="225.21" dur="1.32">if you want, I&amp;#39;ll link that below.</text><text start="226.53" dur="4.68">But then the thing is
that&amp;#39;s kind of all we got.</text><text start="231.21" dur="2.73">Like there were shockingly
few details about</text><text start="233.94" dur="3.57">the actual car actually
explained at this event</text><text start="237.51" dur="2.49">other than basically like
the three main pillars</text><text start="240" dur="2.34">which are gonna be in all the
headlines which are number one</text><text start="242.34" dur="3.66">that it will be fully
unsupervised, self-driving capable.</text><text start="246" dur="2.13">Number two, that it&amp;#39;ll
be able to be purchased</text><text start="248.13" dur="3.9">for under $30,000, all right.</text><text start="252.03" dur="2.22">But then number three, that
it would actually also charge</text><text start="254.25" dur="2.1">by inductive wireless charging.</text><text start="256.35" dur="2.22">So it pulls up over this
wireless charging pad</text><text start="258.57" dur="3.84">on the ground and it
would charge that way.</text><text start="262.41" dur="3.18">Not something we&amp;#39;ve seen
shipping in very many cars,</text><text start="265.59" dur="2.981">especially not ones with large
batteries, but that was it.</text><text start="268.571" dur="2.599">No other numbers, no other specs.</text><text start="271.17" dur="5">Just look at this thing,
there&amp;#39;s just concepts of a plan.</text><text start="276.69" dur="2.22">I just had so many other
questions after seeing that.</text><text start="278.91" dur="1.17">Like what is going on here?</text><text start="280.08" dur="3.33">I did at the event walk
around after the announcement</text><text start="283.41" dur="1.68">and bump into some Tesla engineers</text><text start="285.09" dur="1.92">and people who had been
working on these things.</text><text start="287.01" dur="2.49">And so, I just ended up
kind of grilling them.</text><text start="289.5" dur="1.62">Like I asked them a
whole bunch of questions.</text><text start="291.12" dur="3.09">So I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you guys
what I learned from them</text><text start="294.21" dur="2.16">and I guess we can take their word for it.</text><text start="296.37" dur="1.95">So first of all, there
is no steering wheel</text><text start="298.32" dur="2.61">or pedals, as you can see
so my first question was,</text><text start="300.93" dur="2.1">all right, let&amp;#39;s say I
see an accident coming</text><text start="303.03" dur="1.343">or there&amp;#39;s something happening
on the road in front of me</text><text start="304.373" dur="2.287">and the car isn&amp;#39;t reacting in time,</text><text start="306.66" dur="2.34">is there a manual override?</text><text start="309" dur="3.12">And the answer I got
was, sure, there will be</text><text start="312.12" dur="2.49">some sort of minimal
onscreen controls available,</text><text start="314.61" dur="2.4">but the goal is that you
never have to override</text><text start="317.01" dur="3.93">which is a noble goal, for sure.</text><text start="320.94" dur="1.35">I just mean it&amp;#39;s hard to imagine.</text><text start="322.29" dur="2.07">We live in a world
where that&amp;#39;s impossible,</text><text start="324.36" dur="2.46">basically, right now but I mean,</text><text start="326.82" dur="1.14">even with the wireless charger,</text><text start="327.96" dur="1.83">picture you wanna like drive over</text><text start="329.79" dur="1.92">the top of it and line it up perfectly</text><text start="331.71" dur="1.83">because if it&amp;#39;s off a little bit,</text><text start="333.54" dur="2.31">that&amp;#39;s just a giant waste of power.</text><text start="335.85" dur="4.53">But if I can&amp;#39;t adjust it
like that would be terrible.</text><text start="340.38" dur="1.05">But speaking of wireless charging,</text><text start="341.43" dur="2.34">you might be wondering why
they would try to do this?</text><text start="343.77" dur="1.68">The main answer, again,
is because they want it</text><text start="345.45" dur="1.23">to be totally autonomous.</text><text start="346.68" dur="2.97">They want people to just
be able to own several,</text><text start="349.65" dur="2.28">like a fleet of these things
and they all just drive around</text><text start="351.93" dur="1.86">and charge themselves overnight.</text><text start="353.79" dur="2.85">And the whole cable
plugging in charging thing</text><text start="356.64" dur="3.45">requires a human so that&amp;#39;s
one less human required.</text><text start="360.09" dur="2.43">It&amp;#39;ll just line up on the notoriously</text><text start="362.52" dur="1.35">inefficient wireless charger.</text><text start="363.87" dur="1.41">But my question again was, okay,</text><text start="365.28" dur="2.94">is there at least a charge port
so if I want to supercharge</text><text start="368.22" dur="2.28">or charge quickly, I can do that?</text><text start="370.5" dur="1.83">And the answer was, no,</text><text start="372.33" dur="2.82">there is no charge port on this vehicle.</text><text start="375.15" dur="3.36">So it is not even capable of
hitting a Tesla supercharger,</text><text start="378.51" dur="1.17">or doing any sort of road trips,</text><text start="379.68" dur="2.22">or anything like that, it&amp;#39;s purely a taxi.</text><text start="381.9" dur="2.25">I&amp;#39;m told there is no
plans for a front trunk.</text><text start="384.15" dur="1.41">There&amp;#39;s just the rear trunk</text><text start="385.56" dur="2.19">that they showed in this presentation.</text><text start="387.75" dur="3.57">And there&amp;#39;s no planned range
or a stated battery size.</text><text start="391.32" dur="2.19">But what they did say
is they&amp;#39;re simply aiming</text><text start="393.51" dur="2.67">for this vehicle to be
as efficient as possible,</text><text start="396.18" dur="2.79">that&amp;#39;s their main goal,
between the aerodynamics</text><text start="398.97" dur="2.34">and the low rolling
resistance tires, they think</text><text start="401.31" dur="4.65">they can aim for about 5.5
miles per kilowatt hour.</text><text start="405.96" dur="2.1">Some of the most efficient
electric cars we see today</text><text start="408.06" dur="3.36">are getting around 3 to 4
miles per kilowatt hour.</text><text start="411.42" dur="2.67">So this would be like
an A plus efficiency,</text><text start="414.09" dur="3.12">if they achieve this and
that&amp;#39;s what will let them use</text><text start="417.21" dur="2.28">a smaller overall size battery</text><text start="419.49" dur="1.47">for the lighter weight of the vehicle.</text><text start="420.96" dur="3">So it&amp;#39;ll be nice, they&amp;#39;re
saying, to clear 200 miles</text><text start="423.96" dur="2.67">of total range and that would put this at</text><text start="426.63" dur="2.04">maybe a 40 kilowatt hour battery pack</text><text start="428.67" dur="2.37">instead of the typical 70 to 130.</text><text start="431.04" dur="3.06">So drive train wise, that
logic does check out.</text><text start="434.1" dur="2.58">You wanna make the cheapest,
most efficient electric car</text><text start="436.68" dur="2.64">of all time, you gotta hit those things.</text><text start="439.32" dur="3.48">But then again, you&amp;#39;re
also telling us this</text><text start="442.8" dur="3.03">while doing a car with scissor
doors and wireless charging.</text><text start="445.83" dur="3.6">So you&amp;#39;re gonna have some
challenges there, for sure.</text><text start="449.43" dur="1.38">But really I think the obvious red flag,</text><text start="450.81" dur="3.45">the biggest red flag to me
is the timeline stuff that,</text><text start="454.26" dur="2.31">I mean this is notorious Elon stuff.</text><text start="456.57" dur="1.597">He gets on stage, he
says, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re gonna have</text><text start="458.167" dur="4.91">&amp;quot;this vehicle out for
$30,000 before 2027.&amp;quot;</text><text start="464.49" dur="2.04">No they&amp;#39;re not, there&amp;#39;s just no way</text><text start="466.53" dur="1.71">that they&amp;#39;re actually
gonna be able to do that.</text><text start="468.24" dur="2.97">I mean if they do, let&amp;#39;s say they do,</text><text start="471.21" dur="2.49">I will shave my head on camera</text><text start="473.7" dur="1.32">&amp;#39;cause I&amp;#39;m not confident they won&amp;#39;t do it.</text><text start="475.02" dur="1.65">Like I wanna be optimistic,
but there&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="476.67" dur="1.35">too much stacked up against it</text><text start="478.02" dur="1.56">because in order to ship this at all</text><text start="479.58" dur="1.32">with no steering wheel and everything,</text><text start="480.9" dur="1.8">they have to get all
the regulatory approval</text><text start="482.7" dur="1.92">for the full self-driving and all that,</text><text start="484.62" dur="3.03">and get all the prices
down in spite of inflation</text><text start="487.65" dur="3.12">and ship something with scissor
doors and all this stuff</text><text start="490.77" dur="3.27">in the next two years,
there&amp;#39;s just no way.</text><text start="494.04" dur="4.02">Tesla&amp;#39;s been promising full
unsupervised self-driving</text><text start="498.06" dur="2.43">for years over and over and over again</text><text start="500.49" dur="2.31">and consistently keeps pushing it back.</text><text start="502.8" dur="3.63">But then also just
price-wise, I get the goal,</text><text start="506.43" dur="5">but Tesla promised a $35,000
Model 3 and years later</text><text start="512.04" dur="2.67">I think they briefly
actually shipped that car</text><text start="514.71" dur="2.79">for that price for a little
bit before discontinuing it.</text><text start="517.5" dur="2.25">Cybertruck, I don&amp;#39;t know if you remember,</text><text start="519.75" dur="1.83">do you remember the base price of</text><text start="521.58" dur="1.343">what they said the Cybertruck would cost</text><text start="522.923" dur="2.05">at the cheapest version when it came out?</text><text start="525.863" dur="3.127">$39,000 and that was about what,</text><text start="528.99" dur="1.41">like four or five years ago?</text><text start="530.4" dur="1.737">Do you know what the cheapest
Cybertruck is right now?</text><text start="532.137" dur="4.863">$95,000, so you can see where
my skepticism is coming from.</text><text start="537" dur="1.14">But even after all that, you know,</text><text start="538.14" dur="2.01">there&amp;#39;s kind of a
philosophical question too</text><text start="540.15" dur="2.91">which is what is the
difference between this,</text><text start="543.06" dur="2.91">this Robotaxi thing and a Model 3?</text><text start="545.97" dur="4.26">Because Tesla has been promising for years</text><text start="550.23" dur="1.77">that the car that people are driving</text><text start="552" dur="2.33">and buying today is gonna be capable</text><text start="554.33" dur="2.2">of full unsupervised self-driving,</text><text start="556.53" dur="1.86">like the Model 3 and the Model Y?</text><text start="558.39" dur="2.4">And it&amp;#39;s actually not clear</text><text start="560.79" dur="1.38">if there&amp;#39;s that many differences.</text><text start="562.17" dur="2.52">I mean, obviously, okay, one&amp;#39;s
gonna have a steering wheel</text><text start="564.69" dur="2.85">and four doors and four
seats and the whole thing</text><text start="567.54" dur="1.53">and maybe be a bit more expensive.</text><text start="569.07" dur="4.5">But like, yeah, if my car is gonna be able</text><text start="573.57" dur="2.606">to do all that stuff I think I want</text><text start="576.176" dur="2.011">the one that can plug into superchargers</text><text start="578.187" dur="2.193">and do all sorts of carrying things.</text><text start="580.38" dur="1.41">Maybe this will be an old fashioned way</text><text start="581.79" dur="1.38">of thinking at some time in the future,</text><text start="583.17" dur="2.19">like every car on the road is autonomous</text><text start="585.36" dur="2.13">and it&amp;#39;s like an &amp;quot;old
school&amp;quot; thing to want the one</text><text start="587.49" dur="3.333">with the steering wheel that
you can drive sometimes, maybe.</text><text start="591.87" dur="2.07">I think the main
advantage of the Robotaxi,</text><text start="593.94" dur="2.61">if it has the exact same capabilities</text><text start="596.55" dur="3.36">as a Model 3 is it&amp;#39;ll
be cheaper, and smaller</text><text start="599.91" dur="2.82">and easier to operate
in a fleet situation.</text><text start="602.73" dur="2.67">That will probably be the main difference</text><text start="605.4" dur="1.29">as far as actually buying these things</text><text start="606.69" dur="2.1">because they&amp;#39;ve been
selling people the dream</text><text start="608.79" dur="3.03">of the car that you buy and own today,</text><text start="611.82" dur="2.46">you&amp;#39;ll drive it to work and
then, when you&amp;#39;re at work,</text><text start="614.28" dur="2.46">it&amp;#39;ll go drive people around as an Uber</text><text start="616.74" dur="1.86">for 10 hours or however long and then,</text><text start="618.6" dur="2.16">you drive it home when you need it</text><text start="620.76" dur="1.59">and then, when you&amp;#39;re
sleeping it&amp;#39;ll continue</text><text start="622.35" dur="1.86">to drive and Uber people around.</text><text start="624.21" dur="1.98">And so, it has all these
amazing capabilities,</text><text start="626.19" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;ll do all this great
stuff, but will it though?</text><text start="630.66" dur="0.833">There&amp;#39;s actually a moment I had</text><text start="631.493" dur="1.627">to re-watch the event &amp;#39;cause I was there</text><text start="633.12" dur="1.77">and people are like
yelling out the whole time</text><text start="634.89" dur="2.97">like stuff at Elon on stage.</text><text start="637.86" dur="2.16">And at this point in the
presentation he goes like,</text><text start="640.02" dur="2.61">oh yeah, Model 3 and Model Y
will also do full self-driving.</text><text start="642.63" dur="2.793">And then someone goes like,
what about the Cybertruck?</text><text start="646.5" dur="1.95">And then he says, oh yeah,
don&amp;#39;t worry, Cybertruck too.</text><text start="648.45" dur="2.19">- So and Cybertruck too, yes, of course.</text><text start="650.64" dur="1.77">Sorry, I don&amp;#39;t wanna forget, yes, yes.</text><text start="652.41" dur="1.71">All our cars, basically.</text><text start="654.12" dur="1.77">- So yeah, okay, all our vehicles great,</text><text start="655.89" dur="1.02">but then it&amp;#39;s kind of quiet,</text><text start="656.91" dur="3.48">but then someone else yells
out, &amp;quot;What about Hardware 3?&amp;quot;</text><text start="660.39" dur="1.92">Which is, basically if you don&amp;#39;t know,</text><text start="662.31" dur="2.913">a reference to older Model 3s.</text><text start="666.06" dur="0.9">And his response...</text><text start="666.96" dur="0.833">- So...</text><text start="667.793" dur="3.371">[Audience Member] Hardware
3, Hardware 3, Hardware 3.</text><text start="671.164" dur="2.039">- Let&amp;#39;s not get nuanced here.</text><text start="675.3" dur="0.833">- [Audience Member] What?
- All right, next slide.</text><text start="676.133" dur="2.797">- So yeah, let&amp;#39;s not get
too nuanced, all our cars</text><text start="678.93" dur="2.25">will have it except maybe
some of the old ones.</text><text start="681.18" dur="1.89">All our cars will be able to
self-drive though, totally.</text><text start="683.07" dur="2.34">We&amp;#39;ll cross that bridge when
we get to it, how &amp;#39;bout that?</text><text start="685.41" dur="1.41">But here&amp;#39;s a bridge that I don&amp;#39;t think</text><text start="686.82" dur="1.17">we&amp;#39;ll ever actually get to cross,</text><text start="687.99" dur="2.19">which is the second thing that was insane</text><text start="690.18" dur="4.23">that was announced at this
event, which is the Robovan.</text><text start="694.41" dur="2.82">So somewhere about halfway
through this presentation,</text><text start="697.23" dur="2.22">they roll out this one of one</text><text start="699.45" dur="4.38">super futuristic looking
massive van thing.</text><text start="703.83" dur="1.56">Kind of looked like a... It looked like</text><text start="705.39" dur="2.49">the military vehicles from
&amp;quot;I, Robot,&amp;quot; to be honest,</text><text start="707.88" dur="2.01">which that&amp;#39;s probably not a good thing.</text><text start="709.89" dur="2.55">But yeah, it rolls out and they give us,</text><text start="712.44" dur="2.67">again, very, very few details.</text><text start="715.11" dur="1.71">This is gonna be a Robovan that can hold</text><text start="716.82" dur="2.37">like up to 20-ish people and it, again,</text><text start="719.19" dur="2.28">will be fully electric
and fully autonomous</text><text start="721.47" dur="3.33">and take groups or teams of
people from point A to point B.</text><text start="724.8" dur="3.3">No manual override necessary, great.</text><text start="728.1" dur="2.94">Have you ever been to CES?</text><text start="731.04" dur="3.06">Have you ever watched videos from CES?</text><text start="734.1" dur="2.91">Every year in January
there&amp;#39;s this trade show,</text><text start="737.01" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s really fun, in
Vegas and if you ever go,</text><text start="740.67" dur="1.71">you&amp;#39;ll notice in the south hall there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="742.38" dur="3.87">a section with all the
cars, the mobility section.</text><text start="746.25" dur="4.08">And you&amp;#39;ll find about 50 of these,</text><text start="750.33" dur="4.02">every year there&amp;#39;s just like
a van with no steering wheel</text><text start="754.35" dur="2.37">and a bunch of seats
that all face the middle.</text><text start="756.72" dur="3.36">And it&amp;#39;s like the future
of mobility concept.</text><text start="760.08" dur="1.41">There&amp;#39;s tons of those.</text><text start="761.49" dur="4.62">None of them ever ship, of
course, because there are rules.</text><text start="766.11" dur="3.36">But I guess there&amp;#39;s
not, to me, a whole lot</text><text start="769.47" dur="2.61">that differentiates that brief concept</text><text start="772.08" dur="2.415">we saw at the Tesla event with dozens</text><text start="774.495" dur="1.305">of other vaporware versions of this</text><text start="775.8" dur="2.01">that I&amp;#39;ve seen before,
that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m saying.</text><text start="777.81" dur="2.01">I mean, the fact that
this one comes from Tesla</text><text start="779.82" dur="1.95">is the main differentiator,
this is the company</text><text start="781.77" dur="2.55">that could maybe
theoretically make it happen.</text><text start="784.32" dur="3.69">But like I said, there&amp;#39;s almost
no details about this thing.</text><text start="788.01" dur="4.11">And I have almost no faith that
that thing that they showed</text><text start="792.12" dur="4.02">with its minimal clearance,
and its glass everywhere</text><text start="796.14" dur="2.04">and just lack of numbers or anything</text><text start="798.18" dur="2.55">I don&amp;#39;t think that we&amp;#39;ll
ever actually see that thing.</text><text start="800.73" dur="2.16">I could eat my words, but
like that seems crazy.</text><text start="802.89" dur="2.97">But then last but not least,
Tesla decided to bring back...</text><text start="805.86" dur="1.55">They decided to remind
us that they&amp;#39;re also</text><text start="807.41" dur="2.95">an AI company, not just a car company</text><text start="810.36" dur="5">by bringing back out the
Optimus humanoid robot again.</text><text start="815.7" dur="3.72">So they had these things all
over this event this time,</text><text start="819.42" dur="3.96">dancing, doing these pre-rehearsed demos.</text><text start="823.38" dur="2.55">But also, they were just
kind of out and about.</text><text start="825.93" dur="2.58">They were serving drinks and snacks</text><text start="828.51" dur="2.85">and they were walking
around and interacting with</text><text start="831.36" dur="2.46">and entertaining people
just like hanging out</text><text start="833.82" dur="2.28">amongst everyone at this event.</text><text start="836.1" dur="2.25">Now, I already have my thoughts
that I&amp;#39;ve talked about,</text><text start="838.35" dur="1.14">you know, humanoid robots before.</text><text start="839.49" dur="1.59">I made a whole video about
it, if you wanna watch it,</text><text start="841.08" dur="1.41">I&amp;#39;ll leave a link below the Like button.</text><text start="842.49" dur="2.16">I&amp;#39;ve talked about Tesla&amp;#39;s Optimus.</text><text start="844.65" dur="3.57">But even just what we saw with that,</text><text start="848.22" dur="3.18">would&amp;#39;ve been a huge step forward
from what we&amp;#39;ve ever seen.</text><text start="851.4" dur="0.833">Like this would&amp;#39;ve been one of</text><text start="852.233" dur="1.837">the most impressive things ever.</text><text start="854.07" dur="2.7">But then, they decided to take it further.</text><text start="856.77" dur="4.47">They also decided to have
these robots talking to people</text><text start="861.24" dur="5">and, I mean, it was way
too fast to be an LLM.</text><text start="868.77" dur="3.33">Like just watch this clip.</text><text start="872.1" dur="2.385">- [Optimus] Would you
like a piece of chocolate?</text><text start="874.485" dur="1.545">- I will take some chocolate.</text><text start="876.03" dur="1.627">- [Optimus] Right on, what&amp;#39;s your name?</text><text start="877.657" dur="2.08">- [Vanessa] Vanessa.</text><text start="879.737" dur="0.905">- [Optimus] Vanessa?</text><text start="880.642" dur="1.452">- Yes, Vanessa.</text><text start="882.094" dur="1.526">- [Optimus] Nice, pleasure
to meet you, Vanessa.</text><text start="883.62" dur="1.326">- Nice to meet you too.
- [Optimus] I&amp;#39;m Optimus.</text><text start="884.946" dur="0.905">- [Optimus] Have a great night
- [Vanessa] Great Optimus</text><text start="885.851" dur="1.606">thank you.
- [Optimus] Bye.</text><text start="887.457" dur="1.983">- Like it&amp;#39;s just a person,</text><text start="889.44" dur="1.1">it&amp;#39;s a person talking through a speaker.</text><text start="890.54" dur="1.42">It it even like stutters</text><text start="891.96" dur="2.31">and makes occasional like human mistakes.</text><text start="894.27" dur="2.28">If you watch a bunch of
videos from the event,</text><text start="896.55" dur="1.14">a bunch of different robots</text><text start="897.69" dur="1.75">all have slightly different voices.</text><text start="900.54" dur="1.32">Yeah, it was a person, for sure.</text><text start="901.86" dur="2.22">And it&amp;#39;s weird because Tesla, at no point,</text><text start="904.08" dur="1.86">at least as of the time of recording,</text><text start="905.94" dur="1.5">has not acknowledged this at all.</text><text start="907.44" dur="1.62">They haven&amp;#39;t said that or confirmed that,</text><text start="909.06" dur="2.37">but people there at the event
have heard various things</text><text start="911.43" dur="2.61">from various engineers,
I talked to two engineers</text><text start="914.04" dur="3.27">who only would tell me,
yes, all of the LLMs</text><text start="917.31" dur="1.803">do run totally on device.</text><text start="920.61" dur="4.44">But like, yeah, no, I don&amp;#39;t think so.</text><text start="925.05" dur="2.01">So this kind of became
like the talking point</text><text start="927.06" dur="2.58">of the whole event, like now we don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="929.64" dur="5">how much of this event
was real or not so real.</text><text start="934.65" dur="3.51">Like how much of what
these robots are doing</text><text start="938.16" dur="2.67">is human controlled or AI.</text><text start="940.83" dur="1.92">You know, there were all
kinds of hand waving,</text><text start="942.75" dur="1.44">and gestures and movements.</text><text start="944.19" dur="1.98">I played charades with one of them.</text><text start="946.17" dur="0.96">You know what it reminds me of?</text><text start="947.13" dur="3.03">Remember that video I did at
Disney&amp;#39;s Imagineering Labs</text><text start="950.16" dur="2.25">where they had these bipedal robots</text><text start="952.41" dur="2.49">that were controlled by
a steam deck controller?</text><text start="954.9" dur="1.53">They did all kinds of walking around</text><text start="956.43" dur="1.5">and stringing animations together</text><text start="957.93" dur="2.22">to entertain people at the parks.</text><text start="960.15" dur="1.2">There&amp;#39;s just a bunch of button presses</text><text start="961.35" dur="1.29">and controllers to make that happen.</text><text start="962.64" dur="2.52">And sure, there&amp;#39;s some
AI to blend that stuff,</text><text start="965.16" dur="2.43">but you could never deny that there&amp;#39;s,</text><text start="967.59" dur="3.72">basically, entirely human
control happening here.</text><text start="971.31" dur="2.94">And that&amp;#39;s, basically,
what I think is happening</text><text start="974.25" dur="2.61">at this Tesla event, lots of impressive</text><text start="976.86" dur="2.07">and entertaining things in the form</text><text start="978.93" dur="1.89">of a super advanced articulating robot</text><text start="980.82" dur="1.35">stringing animations together.</text><text start="982.17" dur="4.74">But it&amp;#39;s just not totally ready
to do this stuff on its own.</text><text start="986.91" dur="2.55">We&amp;#39;ve never seen anything quite like it,</text><text start="989.46" dur="3">even from Boston Dynamics,
but we gotta be real</text><text start="992.46" dur="1.26">about the human assisted part.</text><text start="993.72" dur="1.44">But the thing is, the dream that</text><text start="995.16" dur="2.7">they are selling people
with this specific robot</text><text start="997.86" dur="3.63">is that this thing will
live with you basically,</text><text start="1001.49" dur="4.32">it will be your human
sized friend, actually.</text><text start="1005.81" dur="1.53">They said that it would be your friend,</text><text start="1007.34" dur="2.85">it would do chores for you,
it would live around you</text><text start="1010.19" dur="2.76">and be able to do all these
sorts of tasks on its own using</text><text start="1012.95" dur="1.893">the AI and the vision-based system.</text><text start="1016.16" dur="2.67">I think that&amp;#39;s a really far off dream.</text><text start="1018.83" dur="2.07">AI is really, really quickly improving.</text><text start="1020.9" dur="1.35">But I still think that&amp;#39;s a far off dream.</text><text start="1022.25" dur="4.02">So, you know, to their credit,
this event, it was insane.</text><text start="1026.27" dur="3.18">Like they did a lot of things
that could have gone wrong.</text><text start="1029.45" dur="2.16">And if you told me in 2024 that a company</text><text start="1031.61" dur="3.21">would do a bunch of self-driving car demos</text><text start="1034.82" dur="2.88">around tons of people
just loose in the road</text><text start="1037.7" dur="3.03">and they would have bipedal
humanoid robots roaming</text><text start="1040.73" dur="2.13">around performing tasks
and entertaining people</text><text start="1042.86" dur="2.37">at the same event and that they would have</text><text start="1045.23" dur="4.05">a drone show like that
is just a lot of stuff</text><text start="1049.28" dur="2.16">in a row that is super high tech</text><text start="1051.44" dur="2.34">that could go wrong, but somehow didn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="1053.78" dur="3.93">And it represented, I think,
a very optimistic view</text><text start="1057.71" dur="2.73">of the future, even though
it&amp;#39;s very much still</text><text start="1060.44" dur="5">like concepts, it&amp;#39;s a future that is</text><text start="1065.72" dur="3.69">potentially way more efficient,
potentially way safer</text><text start="1069.41" dur="3.45">and more impressive in
general technologically</text><text start="1072.86" dur="1.35">than the world we live in today.</text><text start="1074.21" dur="2.955">So that by itself, I think is honorable.</text><text start="1077.165" dur="3.345">The things that they
were hoping to be real</text><text start="1080.51" dur="2.07">would be amazing and inspirational</text><text start="1082.58" dur="1.98">and honorable if they actually happened.</text><text start="1084.56" dur="4.38">But since they are also
a public tech company,</text><text start="1088.94" dur="2.94">they felt the need to do demos</text><text start="1091.88" dur="2.64">and give all these big promises.</text><text start="1094.52" dur="3.45">And that&amp;#39;s where it felt
weird because it&amp;#39;s really hard</text><text start="1097.97" dur="2.88">to make promises about when
we&amp;#39;re gonna deliver this future</text><text start="1100.85" dur="2.7">and for what price we&amp;#39;re
gonna deliver this future</text><text start="1103.55" dur="1.98">when it just feels very unlikely.</text><text start="1105.53" dur="1.95">And then doing the like, robots talking,</text><text start="1107.48" dur="2.16">it&amp;#39;s just like now the
whole thing is in question.</text><text start="1109.64" dur="2.94">Like how much of it is real,
how much of it is fake?</text><text start="1112.58" dur="1.47">And then, now we&amp;#39;re focusing on that</text><text start="1114.05" dur="3.87">instead of how cool the future
could someday actually be.</text><text start="1117.92" dur="4.35">That&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m at but
hey, if there is one company</text><text start="1122.27" dur="3.27">that has the best chance of
bringing this all to life,</text><text start="1125.54" dur="3.18">if you made me bet money on one company</text><text start="1128.72" dur="3.783">that I think has the best
odds to get there eventually,</text><text start="1133.4" dur="1.62">then, yeah, it would be the one</text><text start="1135.02" dur="2.67">with the massive data gathering advantage</text><text start="1137.69" dur="1.78">with stuff out there in
the real world today.</text><text start="1139.47" dur="5">It would be Tesla so I&amp;#39;ll
believe it when I see it.</text><text start="1145.85" dur="3.513">Thanks for watching, catch you
guys in the next one, peace.</text></transcript>
