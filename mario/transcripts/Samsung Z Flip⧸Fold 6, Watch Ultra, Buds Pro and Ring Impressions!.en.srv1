(smooth R&amp;amp;B music)</text><text start="2.696" dur="0.833">- Hey! What&amp;#39;s up y&amp;#39;all?</text><text start="3.529" dur="0.833">I&amp;#39;m MKBHD here.</text><text start="4.362" dur="1.878">And today, Samsung had their expected</text><text start="6.24" dur="2.55">summer Unpacked event in July,</text><text start="8.79" dur="2.07">and they announced two new phones</text><text start="10.86" dur="3.51">and three new wearable devices.</text><text start="14.37" dur="1.23">Well, it&amp;#39;s more than that if you count,</text><text start="15.6" dur="2.46">like, the small and the large
sizes, but a lot of stuff.</text><text start="18.06" dur="1.41">I got to go hands-on with all of it,</text><text start="19.47" dur="1.2">and so here are my first impressions.</text><text start="20.67" dur="1.65">So I&amp;#39;m gonna start with
the two new phones.</text><text start="22.32" dur="2.28">This was the reveal of
the newest foldables,</text><text start="24.6" dur="3.42">so you got Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6.</text><text start="28.02" dur="2.28">And in general, these phones are very much</text><text start="30.3" dur="2.61">still minor iterations
on top of the last year.</text><text start="32.91" dur="0.87">Shocker.</text><text start="33.78" dur="0.99">I was actually thinking about that.</text><text start="34.77" dur="2.4">Like, this kind of feels like
a dismissive way of saying it.</text><text start="37.17" dur="1.537">Like, &amp;quot;Oh, Samsung settled.</text><text start="38.707" dur="1.583">&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re not really changing anything.&amp;quot;</text><text start="40.29" dur="2.61">Which is kind of true, but
also, on the other hand,</text><text start="42.9" dur="1.86">these are still phones
that are at the forefront</text><text start="44.76" dur="4.26">of two of some of the most
advanced parts of the tech world,</text><text start="49.02" dur="2.31">which is foldables and AI.</text><text start="51.33" dur="1.14">So there&amp;#39;s that.</text><text start="52.47" dur="1.95">So, yeah, the Fold 6, the big one,</text><text start="54.42" dur="1.95">looks just like the Fold 5.</text><text start="56.37" dur="1.41">You know, square up the sides a bit more,</text><text start="57.78" dur="2.97">change up the look of the camera
housing just a little bit,</text><text start="60.75" dur="2.88">and give it slightly
thinner bezels on the inside</text><text start="63.63" dur="0.9">and the outside.</text><text start="64.53" dur="2.82">And that makes the cover screen
just a tiny bit more usable.</text><text start="67.35" dur="2.55">And now both of these screens
get up to 2,600 knits now.</text><text start="69.9" dur="2.1">Give it the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</text><text start="72" dur="2.07">Give it some new colors.</text><text start="74.07" dur="1.41">And that&amp;#39;s about it.</text><text start="75.48" dur="1.17">You got yourself a new generation.</text><text start="76.65" dur="2.52">I mean, there&amp;#39;s a couple
other even smaller things.</text><text start="79.17" dur="1.83">Like, you know, a slightly better hinge.</text><text start="81" dur="2.16">There is a new ultra-wide camera.</text><text start="83.16" dur="1.8">And the square sides, I think,</text><text start="84.96" dur="1.83">give it a little bit more interior volume,</text><text start="86.79" dur="2.85">which allows for the
60% larger vapor chamber</text><text start="89.64" dur="0.99">for better cooling.</text><text start="90.63" dur="2.43">But aside from that,
like, same battery size,</text><text start="93.06" dur="1.95">same general form factor,</text><text start="95.01" dur="2.67">same under-screen camera on the inside,</text><text start="97.68" dur="1.08">just a lot of the same stuff.</text><text start="98.76" dur="1.41">I think more of the focus for this phone</text><text start="100.17" dur="2.97">and for the others, of
course, is this new AI,</text><text start="103.14" dur="3.33">this Galaxy AI thing that
they&amp;#39;re pushing to the forefront.</text><text start="106.47" dur="1.44">And so kind of similarly to what Apple</text><text start="107.91" dur="1.41">just did a couple months ago</text><text start="109.32" dur="2.4">is they&amp;#39;re trying to
surface all of the AI things</text><text start="111.72" dur="2.97">that they&amp;#39;ve been doing and
some new stuff to the top</text><text start="114.69" dur="1.29">so you can see it all in one place</text><text start="115.98" dur="1.89">so regular people actually use it.</text><text start="117.87" dur="2.828">And they also kind of brand it Galaxy AI.</text><text start="120.698" dur="0.833">Sure.</text><text start="121.531" dur="1.859">So now, in the settings
app, right at the top,</text><text start="123.39" dur="2.49">there&amp;#39;s this new Galaxy AI section</text><text start="125.88" dur="2.07">full of all of the newest features.</text><text start="127.95" dur="2.73">Some of them genuinely useful, I&amp;#39;ll say,</text><text start="130.68" dur="1.89">others maybe not so much.</text><text start="132.57" dur="2.04">Like Call assist, okay,
clearly, that can be useful.</text><text start="134.61" dur="1.65">Like there&amp;#39;s things like the interpreter,</text><text start="136.26" dur="1.5">you can speak back and forth to people</text><text start="137.76" dur="1.14">in different languages.</text><text start="138.9" dur="0.99">That&amp;#39;s cool.</text><text start="139.89" dur="2.43">Note assist is gonna help people</text><text start="142.32" dur="2.01">summarize things inside the Notes app.</text><text start="144.33" dur="2.34">Transcript assist will
summarize voice notes.</text><text start="146.67" dur="2.16">All these things are pretty standard.</text><text start="148.83" dur="0.99">We&amp;#39;ve seen them before.</text><text start="149.82" dur="1.86">If you use Samsung&amp;#39;s browser</text><text start="151.68" dur="1.62">instead of Chrome for some reason,</text><text start="153.3" dur="1.89">you can hit that stars AI button</text><text start="155.19" dur="1.77">and get all the summarization you&amp;#39;d want</text><text start="156.96" dur="2.04">of any webpage that has
a bunch of text on it.</text><text start="159" dur="0.96">We&amp;#39;ve seen that before.</text><text start="159.96" dur="1.98">Generative fill of some extra information</text><text start="161.94" dur="2.13">from a photo you&amp;#39;ve taken is also not new,</text><text start="164.07" dur="2.28">but now it&amp;#39;s new to Samsung&amp;#39;s Gallery app.</text><text start="166.35" dur="2.91">So if you wanna make a photo a wider angle</text><text start="169.26" dur="1.47">than it actually was when you took it,</text><text start="170.73" dur="1.527">or maybe just straighten
the horizon or something,</text><text start="172.257" dur="2.073">and you need to fill in some corners,</text><text start="174.33" dur="2.7">it seems to do a surprisingly
good job at that.</text><text start="177.03" dur="2.55">But then there&amp;#39;s also Drawing assist,</text><text start="179.58" dur="3.66">which can take something
you draw or sketch in Notes,</text><text start="183.24" dur="3.69">even if you&amp;#39;re an absolute
piss-poor artist like myself,</text><text start="186.93" dur="1.89">and it generates art</text><text start="188.82" dur="3.81">in any number of different
styles from it in Samsung Notes.</text><text start="192.63" dur="2.16">It looks almost exactly like what Apple&amp;#39;s,</text><text start="194.79" dur="2.16">like, Image Playgrounds app is doing.</text><text start="196.95" dur="2.64">The watercolor style, a little more tame,</text><text start="199.59" dur="2.79">but then there&amp;#39;s also
this 3D cartoon style.</text><text start="202.38" dur="3.6">And if you give it some time,
honestly, pretty impressive.</text><text start="205.98" dur="3.45">I don&amp;#39;t know if this is good
art, but it&amp;#39;s just a lot.</text><text start="209.43" dur="2.46">You know, that&amp;#39;s a lot to
do with my finger painting.</text><text start="211.89" dur="2.07">So anyway, the Z Flip 6</text><text start="213.96" dur="3.15">is again along a lot of the
same lines as the Z Fold 6.</text><text start="217.11" dur="2.01">So again, Snapdragon 8 Gen 3,</text><text start="219.12" dur="2.19">squared-up sides,
slightly refreshed design.</text><text start="221.31" dur="1.98">And spec-wise, they&amp;#39;ve kind
of matched a lot of things</text><text start="223.29" dur="1.53">with the base S24.</text><text start="224.82" dur="2.91">So it actually has the
camera from the base S24:</text><text start="227.73" dur="1.89">The 50-megapixel main camera</text><text start="229.62" dur="1.86">and the 12-megapixel ultra-wide.</text><text start="231.48" dur="1.5">The battery gets bigger,</text><text start="232.98" dur="2.85">it goes from 3,700 up
to 4,000 milliamp hours,</text><text start="235.83" dur="0.99">which is promising.</text><text start="236.82" dur="1.89">And that inside screen does also get</text><text start="238.71" dur="2.07">to 2,600 knits now, as well.</text><text start="240.78" dur="1.02">And there&amp;#39;s a wider variety</text><text start="241.8" dur="1.74">of, like, widgets for the outside screen.</text><text start="243.54" dur="1.68">So, ideally, it just gets
a little bit more useful</text><text start="245.22" dur="0.833">than before.</text><text start="246.053" dur="1.597">And it also gets a vapor chamber</text><text start="247.65" dur="1.95">for the first time in a Flip</text><text start="249.6" dur="2.43">and a new base of 12 gigs of RAM.</text><text start="252.03" dur="2.13">And there&amp;#39;s these new colored metal rings</text><text start="254.16" dur="1.807">around the cameras, so you
can kind of visually tell,</text><text start="255.967" dur="1.103">&amp;quot;Oh, this is the new one.&amp;quot;</text><text start="257.07" dur="1.29">Like, I&amp;#39;m convinced that&amp;#39;s the only reason</text><text start="258.36" dur="0.833">they did these rings.</text><text start="259.193" dur="1.867">But yeah, we&amp;#39;ll have
to see if these phones</text><text start="261.06" dur="2.16">and their folding screens age better</text><text start="263.22" dur="1.23">than the previous generation.</text><text start="264.45" dur="2.01">Obviously, a slightly
better hinge can help,</text><text start="266.46" dur="0.96">but as far as I can tell,</text><text start="267.42" dur="2.37">they just look like the
same level of crease,</text><text start="269.79" dur="1.83">the same feel of a hinge,</text><text start="271.62" dur="2.94">just overall very similar
hardware package to the last year.</text><text start="274.56" dur="1.86">The cherry on top, though,
is these phones are both</text><text start="276.42" dur="1.53">100 bucks more than last year.</text><text start="277.95" dur="4.38">So the Z Flip 6 is gonna
be 1,099 instead of $1,000,</text><text start="282.33" dur="4.23">and then the Fold is gonna
be 1,899 instead of 1,799.</text><text start="286.56" dur="2.22">So it&amp;#39;s the direction they&amp;#39;re trending.</text><text start="288.78" dur="1.26">But then there&amp;#39;s also the wearable stuff</text><text start="290.04" dur="0.833">that they announced,</text><text start="290.873" dur="2.377">and I think people will
be just as interested in,</text><text start="293.25" dur="2.28">maybe even more interested
in the wearables</text><text start="295.53" dur="1.59">than the phone refresh stuff.</text><text start="297.12" dur="5">So there&amp;#39;s two new watches,
two new earbuds, and the ring.</text><text start="302.22" dur="3.42">So the Galaxy Watch 7 gets
a nice little refresh.</text><text start="305.64" dur="2.16">Nothing too dramatic, it
still looks super familiar,</text><text start="307.8" dur="2.82">and it stays starting at
299 for the 40-millimeter.</text><text start="310.62" dur="1.89">But then they&amp;#39;ve dropped in a big one.</text><text start="312.51" dur="3.6">There is a Galaxy Watch 7
Ultra in the lineup now.</text><text start="316.11" dur="0.87">We saw the rumors,</text><text start="316.98" dur="1.44">I talked about on the &amp;quot;Waveform&amp;quot; podcast.</text><text start="318.42" dur="1.29">This is something that we&amp;#39;ve been</text><text start="319.71" dur="1.26">kind of expecting for a bit.</text><text start="320.97" dur="3.03">And what they&amp;#39;ve finally come
up with is titanium body,</text><text start="324" dur="1.26">sapphire crystal display,</text><text start="325.26" dur="4.38">same size 1.5-inch circular
display as the 44-millimeter,</text><text start="329.64" dur="2.94">but a much beefier body around it</text><text start="332.58" dur="2.82">to fit in a 590-milliamp hour battery.</text><text start="335.4" dur="2.4">It&amp;#39;s water resistant to 100 meters.</text><text start="337.8" dur="1.95">They gave it a new watch face.</text><text start="339.75" dur="2.88">Dual frequency GPS, which is
also coming to the Watch 7.</text><text start="342.63" dur="4.05">And as you can see, they gave
it this big orange button</text><text start="346.68" dur="1.95">called the Action Button.</text><text start="348.63" dur="2.73">Oh, sorry, I mean the Quick Button.</text><text start="351.36" dur="1.171">It&amp;#39;s called the Quick Button.</text><text start="352.531" dur="3.569">(laughs) Which is a custom
mappable, yes, activity button</text><text start="356.1" dur="1.89">that can start any number
of different activities</text><text start="357.99" dur="1.92">or workouts or whatever you want it to do.</text><text start="359.91" dur="1.89">I mean, look, it&amp;#39;s clear
that this is targeted</text><text start="361.8" dur="1.47">at the Apple Watch Ultra.</text><text start="363.27" dur="1.47">I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re
trying to hide that at all.</text><text start="364.74" dur="1.29">It&amp;#39;s literally the same name.</text><text start="366.03" dur="4.23">But this one is also $650
instead of Apple&amp;#39;s $800.</text><text start="370.26" dur="1.35">So my question is basically</text><text start="371.61" dur="1.5">just how do they stack up head-to-head?</text><text start="373.11" dur="2.52">Battery-wise, it may actually be better.</text><text start="375.63" dur="2.94">They&amp;#39;re saying it can do 100
hours in power-saving mode.</text><text start="378.57" dur="3.15">But also, you know, feature-wise,
accuracy-wise, we&amp;#39;ll see.</text><text start="381.72" dur="1.47">Samsung is also doing this new thing</text><text start="383.19" dur="1.26">where they basically compile</text><text start="384.45" dur="1.86">all of your health metrics
from everything they measure</text><text start="386.31" dur="3.9">into one score, an Energy Score, with AI.</text><text start="390.21" dur="1.71">And I wanna give that a shot, as well.</text><text start="391.92" dur="1.86">But yeah, this is basically
just an obvious entry</text><text start="393.78" dur="2.97">to give you an option at
that higher price point,</text><text start="396.75" dur="1.65">like Apple&amp;#39;s done with their Ultra watch,</text><text start="398.4" dur="1.86">so now it&amp;#39;s gonna be out there.</text><text start="400.26" dur="5">Now, they also announced the
new Galaxy Buds3 and Buds2 Pro,</text><text start="405.72" dur="1.71">and they have obvious equivalents</text><text start="407.43" dur="1.11">in other ecosystems, as well.</text><text start="408.54" dur="2.04">But there&amp;#39;s some new cases
and new designs here.</text><text start="410.58" dur="1.59">Everyone&amp;#39;s saying,
actually, aesthetically,</text><text start="412.17" dur="2.7">they look like the
first-generation AirPods,</text><text start="414.87" dur="2.16">which they&amp;#39;re not wrong,
especially at the top.</text><text start="417.03" dur="2.64">But then these long stems on the Buds Pro</text><text start="419.67" dur="3.21">actually have these blade lights
to indicate different modes</text><text start="422.88" dur="1.95">or statuses, which is pretty interesting.</text><text start="424.83" dur="1.86">And then, of course, they beef up the Pros</text><text start="426.69" dur="1.32">over the regular buds,</text><text start="428.01" dur="3.72">with things like Ambient
mode and soft tips</text><text start="431.73" dur="2.37">and this new adaptive noise cancellation</text><text start="434.1" dur="3.21">that goes up or down based on
the surroundings, like sirens.</text><text start="437.31" dur="2.73">So the Buds3 are 179,</text><text start="440.04" dur="2.7">and the Buds Pro are 249.</text><text start="442.74" dur="2.22">But last but not least,
they finally gave us details</text><text start="444.96" dur="2.4">on the ring, that thing that they teased,</text><text start="447.36" dur="1.23">I don&amp;#39;t know how many months ago it was</text><text start="448.59" dur="1.71">when we first saw it.</text><text start="450.3" dur="2.07">And the idea is pretty simple.</text><text start="452.37" dur="2.64">It&amp;#39;s a ring, it&amp;#39;s a 24/7 fitness tracker,</text><text start="455.01" dur="2.28">something that you can wear
not just while you&amp;#39;re awake,</text><text start="457.29" dur="1.77">but when you sleep and when you shower</text><text start="459.06" dur="1.68">and going swimming and all that stuff.</text><text start="460.74" dur="1.89">Something you just always have on you.</text><text start="462.63" dur="2.97">Now, I&amp;#39;ve actually never
tested a smart ring before,</text><text start="465.6" dur="0.833">believe it or not.</text><text start="466.433" dur="2.047">I play a lot of sports with my hands.</text><text start="468.48" dur="2.04">I&amp;#39;ve never worn a ring for a long time.</text><text start="470.52" dur="2.49">But from what I understand, the Oura Ring</text><text start="473.01" dur="2.01">is basically the standard</text><text start="475.02" dur="1.17">that everyone is kind of familiar with,</text><text start="476.19" dur="2.64">so I&amp;#39;m assuming Samsung&amp;#39;s
gonna at least try to match</text><text start="478.83" dur="1.29">what the Oura Ring does.</text><text start="480.12" dur="1.74">So we finally get to
see this Samsung ring,</text><text start="481.86" dur="3.3">and it looks basically exactly
like any other smart ring.</text><text start="485.16" dur="1.59">Pretty minimal on the outside,</text><text start="486.75" dur="3.3">actually a slightly concave
design to avoid scratching,</text><text start="490.05" dur="1.05">which I think is pretty clever.</text><text start="491.1" dur="1.98">And then, it comes in
three different finishes</text><text start="493.08" dur="1.14">on a titanium frame.</text><text start="494.22" dur="3.12">There&amp;#39;s matte black or silver or gold.</text><text start="497.34" dur="2.52">I&amp;#39;ll give you one guess
of what my favorite is.</text><text start="499.86" dur="3.54">It&amp;#39;s seven millimeters wide
and 2.6 millimeters thick.</text><text start="503.4" dur="2.19">The sensors are all on
the inside as expected,</text><text start="505.59" dur="3.78">so heart rate, skin temperature,
accelerometer, et cetera.</text><text start="509.37" dur="2.7">And also, it&amp;#39;s water resistant
to 100 meters, as well.</text><text start="512.07" dur="3.54">So this thing is claiming a
roughly seven-day battery life,</text><text start="515.61" dur="1.14">depending on your size.</text><text start="516.75" dur="1.17">And once it&amp;#39;s dead,</text><text start="517.92" dur="2.58">you can pop it on this
clever little charging case</text><text start="520.5" dur="1.95">that, when you do, it
kind of lights up a ring</text><text start="522.45" dur="2.49">around the ring to show
you your charging status,</text><text start="524.94" dur="0.833">which is kind of cool.</text><text start="525.773" dur="2.617">And it should give you
about 1 1/2 more times</text><text start="528.39" dur="2.7">the total life of the ring until
you charge it all up again.</text><text start="531.09" dur="3.3">And then the price will be 399,</text><text start="534.39" dur="4.2">which is 100 bucks more than
the base Oura Ring price.</text><text start="538.59" dur="3.51">But the difference here
is no subscription cost.</text><text start="542.1" dur="1.83">So the Oura Ring does have a subscription,</text><text start="543.93" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s, like, six bucks a month,
and that eventually adds up.</text><text start="547.77" dur="1.74">But this will just be 399 for the watch.</text><text start="549.51" dur="2.61">It gets all the features,
all the Samsung Health stuff,</text><text start="552.12" dur="3.33">but you also must use
a Samsung Galaxy phone</text><text start="555.45" dur="1.77">and the Samsung Health app.</text><text start="557.22" dur="1.38">So yeah, I&amp;#39;m happy to see some competition</text><text start="558.6" dur="2.49">that isn&amp;#39;t a subscription.</text><text start="561.09" dur="0.859">And that&amp;#39;s kind of it.</text><text start="561.949" dur="2.081">That is what Samsung announced today.</text><text start="564.03" dur="3.09">It&amp;#39;s two new phones, it&amp;#39;s two new earbuds,</text><text start="567.12" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s two new watches, and the ring,</text><text start="570.9" dur="2.67">and that&amp;#39;s all hitting
shelves relatively soon.</text><text start="573.57" dur="2.01">All pretty premiumly priced, as well.</text><text start="575.58" dur="1.05">Wow, that was an alliteration.</text><text start="576.63" dur="1.08">That was total accident.</text><text start="577.71" dur="2.31">But yeah, all this
stuff&amp;#39;s coming out soon.</text><text start="580.02" dur="1.68">Now, before you go, what if I told you</text><text start="581.7" dur="2.223">this phone is worth $1 million?</text><text start="585.72" dur="2.22">And it&amp;#39;s not actually, but let me explain</text><text start="587.94" dur="1.83">what channel sponsor
dbrand has going on here.</text><text start="589.77" dur="2.76">So this is their latest
drop called Case Hardened.</text><text start="592.53" dur="1.77">So, if you&amp;#39;ve ever
played &amp;quot;Counter-Strike,&amp;quot;</text><text start="594.3" dur="1.41">apparently, you&amp;#39;ll already know</text><text start="595.71" dur="2.97">about the in-game economy
for Case Hardened skins.</text><text start="598.68" dur="2.67">In fact, just last month,
this AK-47 apparently sold</text><text start="601.35" dur="3.45">for over $1 million, like, actual dollars.</text><text start="604.8" dur="4.77">Apparently, this Blue Gem skin
is about a one in 21 million,</text><text start="609.57" dur="0.96">like, ultra rare.</text><text start="610.53" dur="1.38">Now, real &amp;quot;Counter-Strike&amp;quot; fans</text><text start="611.91" dur="1.38">are probably already typing comments</text><text start="613.29" dur="2.88">about how dbrand Case
Hardened isn&amp;#39;t random,</text><text start="616.17" dur="2.85">and there aren&amp;#39;t any actual Blue Gems.</text><text start="619.02" dur="1.47">But here&amp;#39;s the thing:</text><text start="620.49" dur="1.44">Just like in the game,</text><text start="621.93" dur="2.79">dbrand made thousands of
Case Hardened patterns.</text><text start="624.72" dur="3.39">And yes, some of them
are random Blue Gems.</text><text start="628.11" dur="3.509">It won&amp;#39;t be quite one in 21
million, but they look awesome.</text><text start="631.619" dur="2.911">Both designs have a sort
of a metallic sheen.</text><text start="634.53" dur="1.11">The way the light plays off them</text><text start="635.64" dur="2.19">kind of makes it fun to stare
at the back of your phone</text><text start="637.83" dur="1.02">instead of the front.</text><text start="638.85" dur="0.99">Maybe that&amp;#39;s healthy?</text><text start="639.84" dur="1.23">But I&amp;#39;ll leave a link down
below in the description</text><text start="641.07" dur="1.83">in case you wanna check it
out and spice up your device.</text><text start="642.9" dur="1.86">&amp;#39;Cause, yeah, Samsung does not exactly</text><text start="644.76" dur="1.83">go hard with the colors usually.</text><text start="646.59" dur="2.13">Yeah, either way, that&amp;#39;s been it.</text><text start="648.72" dur="1.32">Let me know what you
think of these new devices</text><text start="650.04" dur="0.833">and these new wearables</text><text start="650.873" dur="2.557">and which ones you wanna
see reviews of first.</text><text start="653.43" dur="1.71">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="655.14" dur="1.53">Catch you guys on the next one.</text><text start="656.67" dur="0.86">Peace.</text><text start="657.53" dur="2.917">(smooth R&amp;amp;B music)</text></transcript>
