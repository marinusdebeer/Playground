<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.133" dur="3.107">- I actually love this thing.</text><text start="3.24" dur="2.28">I love this thing, not because
it&amp;#39;s flawless or anything,</text><text start="5.52" dur="1.719">it is far from flawless,</text><text start="7.239" dur="3.141">but because it&amp;#39;s actually interesting.</text><text start="10.38" dur="2.52">Like, don&amp;#39;t forget the
last two, three years</text><text start="12.9" dur="2.869">of Apple Product review comments are just,</text><text start="15.769" dur="2.261">&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s boring, oh, it&amp;#39;s just a spec bump,</text><text start="18.03" dur="1.41">there&amp;#39;s nothing really new here,</text><text start="19.44" dur="1.35">oh, they hardly change anything</text><text start="20.79" dur="2.49">or try anything new these days.&amp;quot;</text><text start="23.28" dur="2.91">But this, this thing is interesting.</text><text start="26.19" dur="2.91">It&amp;#39;s risky, and most of all, it&amp;#39;s new.</text><text start="29.1" dur="2.64">Now, it&amp;#39;s actually not fundamentally new,</text><text start="31.74" dur="2.7">it&amp;#39;s a VR headset, but it&amp;#39;s new for Apple.</text><text start="34.44" dur="1.92">And there are a bunch of things in here</text><text start="36.36" dur="3.12">that are new in a way
that only Apple would try.</text><text start="39.48" dur="3.81">And just as interesting
as this individual product</text><text start="43.29" dur="3.93">is the possible future that this implies.</text><text start="47.22" dur="2.43">Like, when you get a first
generation product like this,</text><text start="49.65" dur="2.04">you sort of automatically assume</text><text start="51.69" dur="2.16">that there are goals for its future,</text><text start="53.85" dur="1.77">that it&amp;#39;ll have another generation</text><text start="55.62" dur="1.35">and another one after that,</text><text start="56.97" dur="1.08">and that there is some goal</text><text start="58.05" dur="3.09">for what this will turn
into 10 years down the road</text><text start="61.14" dur="2.61">because we saw what
happened with the iPhone</text><text start="63.75" dur="1.86">and the Mac and the iPad</text><text start="65.61" dur="2.19">and all sorts of other
first generation products.</text><text start="67.8" dur="4.11">And on top of all of that, as
far as I know, Apple has never</text><text start="71.91" dur="2.76">released any other
first generation product</text><text start="74.67" dur="3.03">with the word Pro already in the name,</text><text start="77.7" dur="2.52">which comes with a whole
nother set of implications.</text><text start="80.22" dur="4.259">So is the world ready for all of this?</text><text start="84.479" dur="1.61">Let&amp;#39;s get into it.</text><text start="86.089" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text><text start="99.18" dur="2.85">So I might be one of the
20 people outside of Apple</text><text start="102.03" dur="2.37">who has been using the Vision Pro</text><text start="104.4" dur="1.8">the most over the past two weeks.</text><text start="106.2" dur="3.27">Like, I&amp;#39;ve spent hours in
this thing with both bands,</text><text start="109.47" dur="3.3">with multiple Macs, in different
setups, different rooms,</text><text start="112.77" dur="3.33">indoors and outdoors,
lightness and darkness.</text><text start="116.1" dur="3.93">There are parts of this thing
that are absolutely amazing,</text><text start="120.03" dur="1.89">unparalleled, best I&amp;#39;ve ever seen.</text><text start="121.92" dur="2.61">But the reason it&amp;#39;s so interesting</text><text start="124.53" dur="1.92">is because it&amp;#39;s actually new</text><text start="126.45" dur="3.66">and there are downfalls
and flaws and trade-offs</text><text start="130.11" dur="2.07">that come alongside all of this stuff.</text><text start="132.18" dur="1.53">So at the end of the last video,</text><text start="133.71" dur="1.77">I gave you guys a sort of a preview</text><text start="135.48" dur="1.71">of my pros and cons list.</text><text start="137.19" dur="2.01">If you haven&amp;#39;t already watched that video,</text><text start="139.2" dur="1.53">it is definitely worth watching,</text><text start="140.73" dur="1.47">almost like a prequel to this one.</text><text start="142.2" dur="3.75">It is a 30 minute monster all
about how to use this thing,</text><text start="145.95" dur="3.36">how it works, what&amp;#39;s inside,
what it&amp;#39;s capable of.</text><text start="149.31" dur="1.74">And then, at the end, I got to my upsides,</text><text start="151.05" dur="3.06">which are immersiveness,
placement and space,</text><text start="154.11" dur="1.89">eye tracking and hand control,</text><text start="156" dur="3.9">passthrough, ecosystem, and spatial audio.</text><text start="159.9" dur="3.09">And the downsides, which
are weight and comfort,</text><text start="162.99" dur="1.68">the eyes on the outside,</text><text start="164.67" dur="3.87">app selection right now,
battery life, and price.</text><text start="168.54" dur="1.29">So, okay, for starters,</text><text start="169.83" dur="3.45">I wanna amend immersiveness to fidelity,</text><text start="173.28" dur="1.35">I think that&amp;#39;s more accurate here.</text><text start="174.63" dur="3.27">I have used a bunch of
different VR headsets now,</text><text start="177.9" dur="3.15">and this Vision Pro has the sharpest,</text><text start="181.05" dur="3">best looking micro-OLED
display out of all of them.</text><text start="184.05" dur="2.22">The size of individual
pixels on these displays</text><text start="186.27" dur="1.8">is seven and a half microns,</text><text start="188.07" dur="2.82">which means you could fit 64 of them</text><text start="190.89" dur="2.64">in the size of a single
iPhone screen&amp;#39;s pixel.</text><text start="193.53" dur="1.44">You can&amp;#39;t see individual pixels,</text><text start="194.97" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s no screen door
effect, it&amp;#39;s awesome.</text><text start="198.36" dur="1.89">The native refresh rate is 90 hertz</text><text start="200.25" dur="1.98">and it will crank up to 96 hertz</text><text start="202.23" dur="3.21">when there&amp;#39;s 24 FPS content
playing to be an even multiple.</text><text start="205.44" dur="2.22">And Apple says that they calibrate</text><text start="207.66" dur="2.55">every single one of
these Vision Pro displays</text><text start="210.21" dur="2.724">from the factory for
maximum color accuracy.</text><text start="212.934" dur="1.356">They&amp;#39;re really good,</text><text start="214.29" dur="3.78">and this is a big reason why
this headset is so expensive.</text><text start="218.07" dur="2.52">But then, and this is gonna
be a recurring theme here,</text><text start="220.59" dur="5">the Vision Pro runs up against
the technology of today</text><text start="225.75" dur="2.31">not being quite advanced enough</text><text start="228.06" dur="4.74">to accomplish what they were
probably hoping as ideal.</text><text start="232.8" dur="1.74">So in the case of these screens, right,</text><text start="234.54" dur="2.88">they&amp;#39;re amazing, there are so many pixels,</text><text start="237.42" dur="1.5">but because there&amp;#39;s so many pixels,</text><text start="238.92" dur="2.49">the computer inside cannot
actually render everything</text><text start="241.41" dur="2.4">in high resolution all
the time at 90 Hertz.</text><text start="243.81" dur="2.22">So instead, it does something clever.</text><text start="246.03" dur="3.09">It combines the insanely fast eye tracking</text><text start="249.12" dur="2.19">with what&amp;#39;s called foveated rendering,</text><text start="251.31" dur="2.91">meaning, it&amp;#39;s only actually
rendering in high resolution</text><text start="254.22" dur="3.6">exactly what you&amp;#39;re looking
at when you&amp;#39;re looking at it.</text><text start="257.82" dur="2.19">The rest is soft and fuzzy.</text><text start="260.01" dur="1.14">That actually works really well</text><text start="261.15" dur="1.71">because that&amp;#39;s exactly how our eyes work.</text><text start="262.86" dur="1.86">It&amp;#39;s really clever, like
you don&amp;#39;t think about it,</text><text start="264.72" dur="2.7">but the thing that you&amp;#39;re looking
at at the moment is sharp,</text><text start="267.42" dur="2.04">but then the rest of
your peripheral vision</text><text start="269.46" dur="1.98">is soft and fuzzy, and that&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="271.44" dur="3.06">So really, now, all of the
computing work is being done</text><text start="274.5" dur="2.67">to track your eyes as fast as possible</text><text start="277.17" dur="1.74">so that there&amp;#39;s no lag between</text><text start="278.91" dur="1.95">when you look at something
and when it becomes sharp.</text><text start="280.86" dur="1.8">Fun fact, you can actually see this</text><text start="282.66" dur="2.58">in screen recordings from the Vision Pro.</text><text start="285.24" dur="1.41">You can see the piece of the screen</text><text start="286.65" dur="1.41">that I&amp;#39;m looking at is sharp,</text><text start="288.06" dur="1.14">and then everything else around it,</text><text start="289.2" dur="4.38">even parts of the same
window are fuzzy on purpose.</text><text start="293.58" dur="1.8">But to my eye, that looks totally natural</text><text start="295.38" dur="2.16">because I&amp;#39;m focusing
on one thing at a time.</text><text start="297.54" dur="1.23">I found that you can also screen record</text><text start="298.77" dur="2.91">with developer mode in Xcode,
and that&amp;#39;ll make the clips 4K</text><text start="301.68" dur="2.55">and it&amp;#39;ll render everything
in HQ all at once.</text><text start="304.23" dur="1.68">But every time I did that,</text><text start="305.91" dur="3.72">it would be choppy and scrolling
would be slow and jittery.</text><text start="309.63" dur="1.2">And I&amp;#39;m thinking that&amp;#39;s just because</text><text start="310.83" dur="2.85">the computers aren&amp;#39;t really
used to rendering everything</text><text start="313.68" dur="1.14">in high quality all the time.</text><text start="314.82" dur="1.56">So it looks like a
higher quality recording,</text><text start="316.38" dur="2.28">but the second I did any
scrolling, it didn&amp;#39;t look as good,</text><text start="318.66" dur="2.64">so I just didn&amp;#39;t use
those recordings as often.</text><text start="321.3" dur="1.38">So the screens are great,</text><text start="322.68" dur="3.66">the position tracking of
objects and space are great,</text><text start="326.34" dur="2.59">the eye tracking is incredibly good.</text><text start="328.93" dur="4.1">The one ding against immersion
on the Vision Pro though,</text><text start="333.03" dur="1.47">and not a lot of people
are talking about this,</text><text start="334.5" dur="1.98">but it&amp;#39;s the field of view.</text><text start="336.48" dur="2.13">See, the first few times
you use this headset,</text><text start="338.61" dur="2.07">you don&amp;#39;t even really
think about it that much.</text><text start="340.68" dur="2.85">You&amp;#39;re so distracted by
all the fun and the newness</text><text start="343.53" dur="2.94">and how cool it is that your
eyes are controlling the thing.</text><text start="346.47" dur="2.16">But eventually, you start
to poke around the edges</text><text start="348.63" dur="1.86">and it turns out, you
know how people are saying</text><text start="350.49" dur="2.55">it kind of looks like ski
goggles from the outside?</text><text start="353.04" dur="1.65">Well, it also kind of
looks like ski goggles</text><text start="354.69" dur="1.74">from the inside a little bit too.</text><text start="356.43" dur="3.48">Again, the middle is super
sharp and incredibly impressive,</text><text start="359.91" dur="2.25">but if I can do my best here
through a YouTube video,</text><text start="362.16" dur="3.42">the edges of the headset
are a little bit further in</text><text start="365.58" dur="1.44">than the edges of your vision.</text><text start="367.02" dur="2.88">And so, there&amp;#39;s a little bit
of like a cone effect going on</text><text start="369.9" dur="1.95">and there&amp;#39;s some chromatic
aberration around the outside.</text><text start="371.85" dur="2.16">So you kind of have this slight feeling</text><text start="374.01" dur="2.88">of looking into a large
tunnel at everything.</text><text start="376.89" dur="1.44">There are actually no
field of view numbers</text><text start="378.33" dur="1.74">published by Apple
anywhere about Vision Pro,</text><text start="380.07" dur="1.26">as far as I can tell,</text><text start="381.33" dur="1.29">and I kind of think that&amp;#39;s on purpose</text><text start="382.62" dur="1.68">because I have noticed
from using them both</text><text start="384.3" dur="3.75">that the Quest 3 has a
better, wider field of view</text><text start="388.05" dur="1.35">just looking inside the headset.</text><text start="389.4" dur="2.19">So if I could change one
thing about the Vision Pro</text><text start="391.59" dur="1.74">to make it more immersive,</text><text start="393.33" dur="3.195">it would be a wider field
of view, no question.</text><text start="396.525" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text><text start="400.02" dur="4.05">Vision Pro has the best
passthrough of any headset</text><text start="404.07" dur="2.73">I&amp;#39;ve ever used, that much
is super clear to me,</text><text start="406.8" dur="1.14">and weirdly enough,</text><text start="407.94" dur="1.92">this doesn&amp;#39;t actually surprise me either.</text><text start="409.86" dur="1.35">Maybe because this is one of the products</text><text start="411.21" dur="1.89">that makes it so obvious</text><text start="413.1" dur="1.47">that they&amp;#39;re thinking
a lot about the future,</text><text start="414.57" dur="2.04">like Apple talks a lot about AR</text><text start="416.61" dur="2.49">and how they want things to just be clear</text><text start="419.1" dur="2.553">and just overlaying things
onto your real world.</text><text start="421.653" dur="1.797">But with today&amp;#39;s technology,</text><text start="423.45" dur="2.19">again, that&amp;#39;s not quite possible yet.</text><text start="425.64" dur="2.1">So instead they have a VR headset,</text><text start="427.74" dur="3.3">but they are using the highest
quality camera feeds possible</text><text start="431.04" dur="3.24">and the highest quality
displays on the inside possible</text><text start="434.28" dur="3.81">to let you almost feel like</text><text start="438.09" dur="2.1">you&amp;#39;re looking through
it at the real world.</text><text start="440.19" dur="1.26">So you put this headset on,</text><text start="441.45" dur="2.76">and the first thing
you see is passthrough,</text><text start="444.21" dur="2.01">I mean, you might as well
call it transparency mode.</text><text start="446.22" dur="2.13">And the sharpness and the colors</text><text start="448.35" dur="2.58">and the very low latency are all so good</text><text start="450.93" dur="2.85">that I really don&amp;#39;t
experience any eye fatigue,</text><text start="453.78" dur="3.33">no matter how long I am
in this passthrough mode,</text><text start="457.11" dur="2.4">despite my eyes being
inches from these screens,</text><text start="459.51" dur="2.04">I can interact with the
real world around me,</text><text start="461.55" dur="1.68">pick things up and look at them,</text><text start="463.23" dur="3.3">I can walk around, between
rooms and not trip on things.</text><text start="466.53" dur="1.98">I tried having people throw things at me</text><text start="468.51" dur="1.59">and I could just catch them.</text><text start="470.1" dur="2.37">I played table tennis
successfully with the headset on,</text><text start="472.47" dur="1.59">which is crazy if you think about</text><text start="474.06" dur="1.35">what&amp;#39;s actually happening here.</text><text start="475.41" dur="4.05">The total latency Apple
says is 12 milliseconds,</text><text start="479.46" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;s from the outside light
hitting the outside sensors</text><text start="482.61" dur="3.657">to the inside image being updated
and hitting your eyeballs,</text><text start="486.267" dur="2.253">that&amp;#39;s incredibly fast,</text><text start="488.52" dur="2.143">and that includes the
exposure time of the cameras.</text><text start="490.663" dur="3.782">That&amp;#39;s the specially
designed R1 chip at work.</text><text start="494.445" dur="3.045">But, as Nilay from The Verge has put it,</text><text start="497.49" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s still cameras and screens,</text><text start="500.91" dur="2.76">like the technology of today isn&amp;#39;t magic.</text><text start="503.67" dur="2.43">So you still have to
expose a camera sensor</text><text start="506.1" dur="3.12">and set ISO and shutter speed, et cetera,</text><text start="509.22" dur="1.92">and you can kind of play
around with this a bit</text><text start="511.14" dur="2.358">just by looking around
like at bright objects</text><text start="513.498" dur="2.207">or high dynamic range environments.</text><text start="515.705" dur="1.285">And you know what,</text><text start="516.99" dur="2.55">for the variety of situations
I&amp;#39;ve thrown at this thing,</text><text start="519.54" dur="2.97">it&amp;#39;s handled it very
impressively the whole time,</text><text start="522.51" dur="2.85">mostly prioritizing smoothness
and high shutter speeds</text><text start="525.36" dur="2.31">at the expense of cranking up the ISO</text><text start="527.67" dur="1.59">and getting way more noise,</text><text start="529.26" dur="1.62">especially in darker environments.</text><text start="530.88" dur="1.08">But you can still see stuff</text><text start="531.96" dur="2.37">like the hand occlusion breaks sometimes</text><text start="534.33" dur="1.5">or look really janky
when you put your hand</text><text start="535.83" dur="0.93">in front of something.</text><text start="536.76" dur="4.2">You can still see objects start
to float a little bit more</text><text start="540.96" dur="2.52">in X, Y, and Z space when
you&amp;#39;re in much lower lighting,</text><text start="543.48" dur="2.1">as opposed to the usual perfect position.</text><text start="545.58" dur="3.804">Again, it&amp;#39;s the best I&amp;#39;ve
ever seen with today&amp;#39;s tech,</text><text start="549.384" dur="2.247">but it definitely still
has a long way to go.</text><text start="551.631" dur="3.399">(upbeat music)</text><text start="555.03" dur="3.78">So honestly, the
ecosystem is, I would say,</text><text start="558.81" dur="2.97">the strongest argument
for a regular person</text><text start="561.78" dur="4.113">going out and buying today&amp;#39;s
version of the Vision Pro.</text><text start="565.893" dur="3.747">Like, every time a new big
product comes out or whatever,</text><text start="569.64" dur="1.297">I get like texts from people,</text><text start="570.937" dur="1.403">&amp;quot;Oh hey, Marques, you know,</text><text start="572.34" dur="2.43">I know you already made like
a 30 minute video about it</text><text start="574.77" dur="1.32">and like unboxed it and did all that,</text><text start="576.09" dur="3.72">but like what do you really
think about the Vision Pro?</text><text start="579.81" dur="3.027">Like, is it good enough?
Should I get one?&amp;quot;</text><text start="583.74" dur="2.97">And, truthfully, probably not.</text><text start="586.71" dur="2.49">But I will say that there
are a good amount of things</text><text start="589.2" dur="2.82">that I do specifically look
forward to using for it,</text><text start="592.02" dur="2.76">and most of those things
are ecosystem related.</text><text start="594.78" dur="2.25">So obviously there&amp;#39;s the
built-in apps, right?</text><text start="597.03" dur="1.65">iMessage works perfectly,</text><text start="598.68" dur="2.64">just like any iPhone or
iPad on your account,</text><text start="601.32" dur="3.12">photos are all loaded up in
here straight from your iPhone.</text><text start="604.44" dur="1.41">This is clearly the headset</text><text start="605.85" dur="3.51">that is best for iPhone
users, Apple ecosystem people,</text><text start="609.36" dur="3.18">but also, little things
too, like continuity.</text><text start="612.54" dur="3.15">So I can copy some text
on my Mac or my iPhone</text><text start="615.69" dur="2.25">and then hit Paste and it
shows up in the Vision Pro.</text><text start="617.94" dur="3.21">But there&amp;#39;s two really
impressive ones to me</text><text start="621.15" dur="3">for very different specific reasons,</text><text start="624.15" dur="3.09">FaceTime and Mac Virtual Display.</text><text start="627.24" dur="5">See, FaceTime is the most only
Apple could ship this thing</text><text start="632.58" dur="1.71">I&amp;#39;ve seen in a long time.</text><text start="634.29" dur="2.79">From the personas scanned
in from the cameras</text><text start="637.08" dur="3.06">on the front of the headset
to the positional tracking</text><text start="640.14" dur="2.4">and responsiveness of the spatial audio,</text><text start="642.54" dur="2.46">it&amp;#39;s all so well thought
out that, you know,</text><text start="645" dur="1.32">once everyone on the call</text><text start="646.32" dur="2.52">gets past the initial
like, &amp;quot;Ah, what is this?&amp;quot;</text><text start="648.84" dur="2.34">The shock, the moment they first see</text><text start="651.18" dur="1.5">the virtual version of you,</text><text start="652.68" dur="2.37">once they first get past that,</text><text start="655.05" dur="2.61">then it actually kind
of slowly gets easier</text><text start="657.66" dur="3.21">and it feels way more
like a normal conversation</text><text start="660.87" dur="1.56">than a normal FaceTime.</text><text start="662.43" dur="1.95">And it trades the
downside of not being able</text><text start="664.38" dur="3.39">to hold up objects to
your camera for a button</text><text start="667.77" dur="3.06">that can switch to a real
time first person view</text><text start="670.83" dur="2.55">where you can use both
hands instead of one.</text><text start="673.38" dur="1.2">Does the audio from these speakers</text><text start="674.58" dur="1.44">still bleed out into the rest of the world</text><text start="676.02" dur="2.49">so anything over half
volume is incredibly audible</text><text start="678.51" dur="2.37">to everyone in the room around you?</text><text start="680.88" dur="3.75">Yeah, but does it also still
sound really, really impressive</text><text start="684.63" dur="3.15">for not actually being real headphones?</text><text start="687.78" dur="0.833">Yeah.</text><text start="688.613" dur="2.917">But the other thing is
Mac Virtual Display.</text><text start="691.53" dur="2.49">This is my number one favorite
feature of the Vision Pro,</text><text start="694.02" dur="1.725">even over like watching movies and stuff.</text><text start="695.745" dur="1.035">Now, first of all,</text><text start="696.78" dur="2.64">yes, you can already do
remote desktop viewing</text><text start="699.42" dur="4.02">on something like a Quest 3,
it&amp;#39;s great, I love that too.</text><text start="703.44" dur="3.63">But this one is way more interesting.</text><text start="707.07" dur="2.82">So this is connecting to your Mac</text><text start="709.89" dur="2.16">and then intaking and re-rendering</text><text start="712.05" dur="2.58">a new virtual display for your Mac,</text><text start="714.63" dur="2.88">not mirroring what&amp;#39;s already
being shown by your computer.</text><text start="717.51" dur="2.64">So you can use your Mac with
all of its existing controls</text><text start="720.15" dur="1.29">you&amp;#39;re already using with it,</text><text start="721.44" dur="4.08">but make your new monitor
literally as big as you want.</text><text start="725.52" dur="3.54">And then, you can open up
simultaneous Vision Pro apps</text><text start="729.06" dur="2.04">all around that Mac display</text><text start="731.1" dur="2.22">and place them all around
the room wherever you want,</text><text start="733.32" dur="2.52">over the walls, floating in midair,</text><text start="735.84" dur="2.52">pin them to other objects,
whatever, you can go nuts.</text><text start="738.36" dur="1.17">Now, is this perfect?</text><text start="739.53" dur="2.04">No, there are definitely trade-offs.</text><text start="741.57" dur="1.59">From even the little things,</text><text start="743.16" dur="1.89">like not being able to see your keyboard</text><text start="745.05" dur="1.92">when you&amp;#39;re in an immersive environment,</text><text start="746.97" dur="1.86">to only being able to have</text><text start="748.83" dur="2.82">a single virtual Mac monitor at a time,</text><text start="751.65" dur="3">to always having to look
where you&amp;#39;re controlling,</text><text start="754.65" dur="1.2">I keep telling you guys,</text><text start="755.85" dur="2.73">there&amp;#39;s definitely extra
brain cycles involved here.</text><text start="758.58" dur="2.04">But I do still think
that, despite all that,</text><text start="760.62" dur="3.63">this is my number one favorite
feature of this Vision Pro.</text><text start="764.25" dur="1.98">The number one thing
that you can buy it for</text><text start="766.23" dur="3.96">and do that you couldn&amp;#39;t do
with any other Apple product.</text><text start="770.19" dur="0.833">I mean, it&amp;#39;s the difference</text><text start="771.023" dur="2.167">between looking like this in a coffee shop</text><text start="773.19" dur="1.9">or looking like this in a coffee shop.</text><text start="776.01" dur="1.11">Pick your poison, I guess.</text><text start="777.12" dur="1.62">I also had a moment where I was using</text><text start="778.74" dur="1.95">the Vision Pro for a
while and I had my Mac</text><text start="780.69" dur="1.35">and some other monitors around me,</text><text start="782.04" dur="2.43">and then I took it off and
then I went and did something</text><text start="784.47" dur="3.36">and then I came back, and before
I put the headset back on,</text><text start="787.83" dur="1.32">I looked up at the wall</text><text start="789.15" dur="2.61">to where I thought a window was gonna be,</text><text start="791.76" dur="2.54">but I hadn&amp;#39;t, I hadn&amp;#39;t...</text><text start="795.246" dur="2.458">I don&amp;#39;t know if that says
more about the headset</text><text start="797.704" dur="1.286">or about me.</text><text start="798.99" dur="3.33">(upbeat music)</text><text start="802.32" dur="3">But speaking of apps, we
gotta get into the weaknesses.</text><text start="805.32" dur="1.29">And the app situation</text><text start="806.61" dur="2.31">on Vision Pro right now is one of them.</text><text start="808.92" dur="2.04">So this is the home
screen of the Vision Pro,</text><text start="810.96" dur="2.34">it has all of your apps,
you can&amp;#39;t rearrange them,</text><text start="813.3" dur="1.17">it&amp;#39;s always alphabetical.</text><text start="814.47" dur="1.23">And this is a developing situation</text><text start="815.7" dur="1.89">that will record and improve over time,</text><text start="817.59" dur="3.57">but as of right now, as I
record this on launch day,</text><text start="821.16" dur="4.233">there are literally 600 apps
made for the Vision Pro.</text><text start="826.47" dur="1.56">And that sounds like a lot at first,</text><text start="828.03" dur="2.1">but then kind of not a lot.</text><text start="830.13" dur="1.95">There are also the millions of other apps</text><text start="832.08" dur="1.92">that are made for the iPad</text><text start="834" dur="3.51">that are compatible with the
Vision Pro that will show up.</text><text start="837.51" dur="3.51">But there&amp;#39;s 600 apps made
specifically for the Vision Pro.</text><text start="841.02" dur="3.21">The few apps that are showing
up here are pretty incredible,</text><text start="844.23" dur="3.48">and they all kind of find
unique and creative ways</text><text start="847.71" dur="2.52">to take advantage of the 3D space.</text><text start="850.23" dur="2.73">And I fully believe the
rest of the developers</text><text start="852.96" dur="2.79">are also kind of still trying
to figure out what to do</text><text start="855.75" dur="2.37">with the 3D space in their own apps,</text><text start="858.12" dur="1.86">or even if it makes sense
to do anything at all</text><text start="859.98" dur="1.41">beyond the normal iPad app.</text><text start="861.39" dur="2.73">But at this point right now today,</text><text start="864.12" dur="3.75">I honestly believe that
there are way more cool ideas</text><text start="867.87" dur="4.53">about VR and AR experiences
than there are actual apps.</text><text start="872.4" dur="1.5">Now, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong,
there are some cool apps,</text><text start="873.9" dur="2.13">and like I said, I&amp;#39;ve shown
some in the past video,</text><text start="876.03" dur="1.32">there are some more in this video</text><text start="877.35" dur="1.86">and there will be more
of them pop up every day.</text><text start="879.21" dur="2.67">But have you seen that video
of gamifying vacuum cleaning</text><text start="881.88" dur="1.53">so that you can actually</text><text start="883.41" dur="3.06">cover your entire floor space like a game?</text><text start="886.47" dur="2.85">It&amp;#39;s not a real app, but if it was,</text><text start="889.32" dur="2.31">it would be pretty sick
and I would totally use it.</text><text start="891.63" dur="1.23">Or maybe you&amp;#39;ve seen that other video</text><text start="892.86" dur="4.17">of watching an F1 race in
Vision Pro, it is so sick,</text><text start="897.03" dur="2.97">it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s a virtual
track overlaid into your space</text><text start="900" dur="2.67">so you can keep track of
everything happening at once,</text><text start="902.67" dur="2.52">plus the times and, you
know, smaller video feeds</text><text start="905.19" dur="2.19">of the battles around
different points of the track.</text><text start="907.38" dur="1.74">This looks genuinely better than</text><text start="909.12" dur="2.88">the actual TV broadcast experience,</text><text start="912" dur="3.18">but it&amp;#39;s also not a real app
yet, it&amp;#39;s just a concept.</text><text start="915.18" dur="1.35">And I&amp;#39;ve seen all kinds of other stuff</text><text start="916.53" dur="3">and I wanna watch an NBA game court side</text><text start="919.53" dur="0.99">in the Vision Pro too,</text><text start="920.52" dur="2.67">but that experience doesn&amp;#39;t
seem to exist yet either.</text><text start="923.19" dur="3.75">Whatever it is about like Apple
jumping into this new space</text><text start="926.94" dur="1.38">and all the implications of like,</text><text start="928.32" dur="3.3">oh, okay, the tech is gonna
start to get better now,</text><text start="931.62" dur="3.09">this sort of unlocked
this new creative layer</text><text start="934.71" dur="4.5">for people to dream of
new AR and VR experiences,</text><text start="939.21" dur="1.44">and it&amp;#39;ll be up to developers</text><text start="940.65" dur="3.6">to actually make that
stuff happen over time,</text><text start="944.25" dur="2.13">with the constraints
of today&amp;#39;s technology.</text><text start="946.38" dur="2.07">But as of right now, not a lot of apps,</text><text start="948.45" dur="3.18">also, no YouTube app, no Netflix app,</text><text start="951.63" dur="4.28">there&amp;#39;s no Spotify app,
there&amp;#39;s no TikTok app yet.</text><text start="955.91" dur="2.83">I hope that Apple can sort
of patch up the relationship</text><text start="958.74" dur="2.4">with these developers
because getting those apps</text><text start="961.14" dur="2.43">will make this a better product.</text><text start="963.57" dur="1.08">But as of right now,</text><text start="964.65" dur="2.953">that is definitely a weakness
of this first gen product.</text><text start="967.603" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text><text start="971.07" dur="1.95">All right, I&amp;#39;m not the only
one who&amp;#39;s been saying this,</text><text start="973.02" dur="2.496">but this is not the
most comfortable headset</text><text start="975.516" dur="1.404">and I figured out why.</text><text start="976.92" dur="1.98">So first of all, everyone&amp;#39;s
mentioned the weight,</text><text start="978.9" dur="3.33">and it&amp;#39;s true, it does weigh like 25% more</text><text start="982.23" dur="1.44">than a lot of other headsets.</text><text start="983.67" dur="1.68">Like, take the Quest 3, for example,</text><text start="985.35" dur="2.31">probably the most popular
one, familiar to most people,</text><text start="987.66" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s mostly plastic
and it weighs 515 grams.</text><text start="991.56" dur="4.62">So Vision Pro being made of
metal and having all this glass,</text><text start="996.18" dur="2.58">weighing in at nearly 650 grams,</text><text start="998.76" dur="0.96">it kind of seems like Apple</text><text start="999.72" dur="1.65">just didn&amp;#39;t care about the weight.</text><text start="1001.37" dur="1.95">But I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the case.</text><text start="1003.32" dur="1.86">Matter of fact, if you&amp;#39;ve
seen the tear downs</text><text start="1005.18" dur="1.71">or if you&amp;#39;ve seen what&amp;#39;s inside</text><text start="1006.89" dur="1.98">this little computer here on your face,</text><text start="1008.87" dur="2.31">this is built incredibly efficiently.</text><text start="1011.18" dur="2.58">There&amp;#39;s carbon fiber in here, magnesium,</text><text start="1013.76" dur="2.4">all sorts of other lightweight materials.</text><text start="1016.16" dur="2.97">Now there&amp;#39;s still lots
of obvious heft on it,</text><text start="1019.13" dur="3.03">but 25% more weight
shouldn&amp;#39;t be the difference</text><text start="1022.16" dur="4.41">between comfortable and, like,
I need to do neck exercises.</text><text start="1026.57" dur="3.534">No, the problem is this strap,</text><text start="1030.104" dur="2.019">this is the Solo Knit strap,</text><text start="1032.123" dur="2.157">this is the strap that&amp;#39;s
in all the commercials</text><text start="1034.28" dur="0.833">that everybody sees.</text><text start="1035.113" dur="1.117">This is what&amp;#39;s on Apple&amp;#39;s website,</text><text start="1036.23" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s in all the Apple stores
because it looks so cool.</text><text start="1039.8" dur="2.76">And I think when Apple was
probably first deciding,</text><text start="1042.56" dur="2.22">okay, we are gonna get into
this VR headset market,</text><text start="1044.78" dur="1.23">how do we differentiate ourselves?</text><text start="1046.01" dur="2.34">We gotta reinvent a few things,</text><text start="1048.35" dur="2.67">like the input method and all this stuff.</text><text start="1051.02" dur="2.847">I think they thought the
strap had to be one of them,</text><text start="1053.867" dur="1.743">and that&amp;#39;s how we got this thing.</text><text start="1055.61" dur="3.33">And I think Dave2D was spot
on in his recent video,</text><text start="1058.94" dur="3.33">VR headsets just kind of all look dumb,</text><text start="1062.27" dur="3.84">and the straps on them are all
so universally lame looking.</text><text start="1066.11" dur="2.22">And this strap is just so much cooler,</text><text start="1068.33" dur="2.79">you put it on, it&amp;#39;s
the quickest to adjust,</text><text start="1071.12" dur="2.16">it messes up your hair the least.</text><text start="1073.28" dur="2.13">It obviously has this
little adjustment thing</text><text start="1075.41" dur="2.13">on the outside so you
can scroll this wheel</text><text start="1077.54" dur="2.837">and satisfyingly like tighten
the cables inside like this.</text><text start="1080.377" dur="2.203">This must have taken a lot of R&amp;amp;D</text><text start="1082.58" dur="2.52">to get this thing to look iconic</text><text start="1085.1" dur="2.01">and actually be functional, this is sick.</text><text start="1087.11" dur="2.19">But when you put it on,</text><text start="1089.3" dur="2.64">you sort of tighten it up
against the front of your face</text><text start="1091.94" dur="2.97">and it&amp;#39;s squeezing it
up against your face,</text><text start="1094.91" dur="2.1">all of the weight, up at the front</text><text start="1097.01" dur="2.55">against basically these
two pressure points,</text><text start="1099.56" dur="3.09">right above your eyes
and right on your cheeks.</text><text start="1102.65" dur="3.78">And the more you tighten
it to prevent light leak,</text><text start="1106.43" dur="2.07">the more uncomfortable it gets.</text><text start="1108.5" dur="3.45">And it&amp;#39;s just, it&amp;#39;s so hard to wear this</text><text start="1111.95" dur="3.06">for more than about 30, 45 minutes.</text><text start="1115.01" dur="2.76">After 45 minutes, I really
do need to take this off.</text><text start="1117.77" dur="1.41">So it&amp;#39;s not your neck as much as</text><text start="1119.18" dur="2.731">it&amp;#39;s just all the pressure
on the front of your face.</text><text start="1121.911" dur="2.489">And Apple knows this,</text><text start="1124.4" dur="4.62">and that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;ve included
in the box this second band,</text><text start="1129.02" dur="1.95">this is the dual loop band,</text><text start="1130.97" dur="3">and it&amp;#39;s super easy to pop this
one off and pop this one on.</text><text start="1133.97" dur="3">Now it&amp;#39;s not as cool
looking as a Solo Knit Band,</text><text start="1136.97" dur="1.62">and it&amp;#39;s going to mess up your hair</text><text start="1138.59" dur="1.68">more than a Solo Knit Band,</text><text start="1140.27" dur="3">and it&amp;#39;s not as easy to
adjust as a Solo Knit Band.</text><text start="1143.27" dur="1.68">You&amp;#39;re literally like trying to find</text><text start="1144.95" dur="3.09">and attach Velcro blindly
at the top of your head.</text><text start="1148.04" dur="1.92">Basically, it&amp;#39;s almost as lame looking</text><text start="1149.96" dur="2.145">as every other VR headset strap.</text><text start="1152.105" dur="3.555">But it turns out they all
look like this for a reason,</text><text start="1155.66" dur="2.52">and oh my God, is it so much better</text><text start="1158.18" dur="1.98">for wearing it for a long time.</text><text start="1160.16" dur="1.41">I just recently did the last episode</text><text start="1161.57" dur="1.05">of the &amp;quot;Waveform Podcast&amp;quot;,</text><text start="1162.62" dur="1.41">you can go subscribe over there.</text><text start="1164.03" dur="2.4">I wore the headset for the entire thing,</text><text start="1166.43" dur="1.62">a two hour recording,</text><text start="1168.05" dur="2.94">and I could never have done
that with the Solo Knit Band,</text><text start="1170.99" dur="1.89">and that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s
taking a ton of the pressure</text><text start="1172.88" dur="2.52">off of the front of your
face and taking the weight</text><text start="1175.4" dur="3.48">and using the top of your
head to support it instead.</text><text start="1178.88" dur="0.99">It&amp;#39;s so much better.</text><text start="1179.87" dur="2.25">So if you&amp;#39;re gonna just hand the headset</text><text start="1182.12" dur="2.37">to someone to use it
for like five minutes,</text><text start="1184.49" dur="1.29">the Solo Knit Band is great</text><text start="1185.78" dur="1.8">&amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s super quick,
doesn&amp;#39;t mess up their hair,</text><text start="1187.58" dur="1.92">easy to adjust, boom.</text><text start="1189.5" dur="1.44">But if you plan on using this thing</text><text start="1190.94" dur="2.97">for an extensive period of time, yeah,</text><text start="1193.91" dur="4.086">the dual loop band is 100% the way to go.</text><text start="1197.996" dur="3.324">(upbeat music)</text><text start="1201.32" dur="2.79">So I don&amp;#39;t know if the eyes
on the outside of this headset</text><text start="1204.11" dur="1.89">are actually accomplishing</text><text start="1206" dur="3.03">what Apple probably
wanted them to accomplish.</text><text start="1209.03" dur="3.03">I think this, again, comes down
to what we expect Vision Pro</text><text start="1212.06" dur="5">to be in the future, see through
glasses, way down the line.</text><text start="1217.07" dur="2.61">But that&amp;#39;s obviously not
possible with today&amp;#39;s tech,</text><text start="1219.68" dur="4.14">so the closest we can get
is a lenticular display</text><text start="1223.82" dur="2.97">that shows your eyes to the outside world,</text><text start="1226.79" dur="3.63">and so that you can see them
and they can kind of see you.</text><text start="1230.42" dur="2.22">I don&amp;#39;t know, at this
point, I&amp;#39;ve tried my eyes,</text><text start="1232.64" dur="1.74">but also everyone else here at the studio</text><text start="1234.38" dur="2.67">has also scanned themselves
in and tried EyeSight,</text><text start="1237.05" dur="2.31">and it&amp;#39;s just not very visible.</text><text start="1239.36" dur="2.1">Like, the smooth glass of the headset</text><text start="1241.46" dur="1.86">is so incredibly reflective</text><text start="1243.32" dur="3">that there&amp;#39;s almost always
some light bouncing off it</text><text start="1246.32" dur="1.68">in a way that makes the eyes hard to see.</text><text start="1248" dur="1.89">And even if you can see it,</text><text start="1249.89" dur="1.29">it&amp;#39;s pretty low resolution,</text><text start="1251.18" dur="1.41">thanks to the lenticular display,</text><text start="1252.59" dur="2.07">and the bottom line is it doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1254.66" dur="3.33">actually feel like eye
contact most of the time,</text><text start="1257.99" dur="0.99">which is very different from</text><text start="1258.98" dur="1.71">what you might have seen in the ads,</text><text start="1260.69" dur="1.65">especially for darker skin tones.</text><text start="1262.34" dur="1.41">And I was actually
thinking about this like,</text><text start="1263.75" dur="2.79">this is so far from
what I think I expected</text><text start="1266.54" dur="0.84">that I was wondering,</text><text start="1267.38" dur="3.21">does Apple in the next
generation Vision Pro</text><text start="1270.59" dur="2.55">double down on EyeSight
or do they get rid of it?</text><text start="1273.14" dur="1.89">And I think they have to keep it,</text><text start="1275.03" dur="2.52">like it&amp;#39;s such an iconic
part of the headset</text><text start="1277.55" dur="1.98">that everyone&amp;#39;s expecting it to stay,</text><text start="1279.53" dur="1.05">so it&amp;#39;s gotta be there.</text><text start="1280.58" dur="5">But also, this is Vision
Pro and I think that implies</text><text start="1285.8" dur="1.83">that we&amp;#39;re gonna get Apple Vision</text><text start="1287.63" dur="1.29">at some point down the road,</text><text start="1288.92" dur="2.94">which is like a less
expensive version of this.</text><text start="1291.86" dur="3.27">And with that, do you take out EyeSight</text><text start="1295.13" dur="3.586">or does that still appear
in the lower end version?</text><text start="1298.716" dur="2.444">I don&amp;#39;t know, only time will tell.</text><text start="1301.16" dur="2.667">(upbeat music)</text><text start="1304.67" dur="2.49">So, all right, look,
at the end of the day,</text><text start="1307.16" dur="1.41">when I&amp;#39;m answering those texts</text><text start="1308.57" dur="1.29">about what do people wanna know</text><text start="1309.86" dur="1.77">what I really think about Vision Pro,</text><text start="1311.63" dur="1.44">I think the Vision Pro</text><text start="1313.07" dur="5">is a really expensive, really fun toy.</text><text start="1318.2" dur="3.51">Like, this is an incredibly
fun piece of tech to play with,</text><text start="1321.71" dur="2.82">and I am loving watching
the pieces of media</text><text start="1324.53" dur="2.25">built specifically for Vision Pro,</text><text start="1326.78" dur="3.03">I am loving playing some
of the new early games</text><text start="1329.81" dur="0.833">that are taking advantage</text><text start="1330.643" dur="2.767">of the 3D space and the hand controls,</text><text start="1333.41" dur="2.52">I am loving the idea of getting on a plane</text><text start="1335.93" dur="2.13">and editing videos on my Mac</text><text start="1338.06" dur="2.22">or watching a movie on a gigantic screen</text><text start="1340.28" dur="3.15">while the person next to me
can&amp;#39;t see any of what I&amp;#39;m doing.</text><text start="1343.43" dur="1.89">That stuff is all so sick.</text><text start="1345.32" dur="1.32">And if you&amp;#39;re actually
thinking about buying one,</text><text start="1346.64" dur="1.29">I think you should be able to expect</text><text start="1347.93" dur="2.37">to enjoy all of that same stuff too.</text><text start="1350.3" dur="3.84">But definitely still note
that all of the symptoms</text><text start="1354.14" dur="1.86">of a first generation product</text><text start="1356" dur="2.28">are definitely also still here.</text><text start="1358.28" dur="2.79">It&amp;#39;s heavy, it&amp;#39;s not a lot of apps,</text><text start="1361.07" dur="3.66">the battery life is
meh and it&amp;#39;s expensive.</text><text start="1364.73" dur="2.16">So here&amp;#39;s the bigger question,</text><text start="1366.89" dur="5">is the Vision Pro a guaranteed
success in the future?</text><text start="1372.5" dur="2.82">Because the first generation iPhone</text><text start="1375.32" dur="3.51">had all of the same
downfalls in its generation,</text><text start="1378.83" dur="1.65">and look at where we are now.</text><text start="1380.48" dur="3.56">So, also, same with the
watch, same with the iPad.</text><text start="1384.04" dur="2.14">But here&amp;#39;s the thing, you can&amp;#39;t just say</text><text start="1386.18" dur="2.58">the other stuff had problems
and it became successful,</text><text start="1388.76" dur="1.95">therefore, this one having problems</text><text start="1390.71" dur="1.17">also means it&amp;#39;s successful.</text><text start="1391.88" dur="0.833">It doesn&amp;#39;t work that way,</text><text start="1392.713" dur="3.037">there has to be something about this</text><text start="1395.75" dur="1.53">that people actually like</text><text start="1397.28" dur="2.25">that makes &amp;#39;em willing to overlook</text><text start="1399.53" dur="2.715">the first generation downfalls.</text><text start="1402.245" dur="3.762">And I think this has it, I think it has,</text><text start="1406.007" dur="3.423">I honestly, it&amp;#39;s kind of
just the sci-fi, fun nature</text><text start="1409.43" dur="1.95">of like controlling
things with your hands,</text><text start="1411.38" dur="1.53">moving windows around the room,</text><text start="1412.91" dur="2.13">the sci-fi movie energy, you&amp;#39;ve seen it,</text><text start="1415.04" dur="1.86">you&amp;#39;re probably already
thinking of a certain movie</text><text start="1416.9" dur="2.97">that has that sort of
energy, this has that.</text><text start="1419.87" dur="1.92">And the fact that these ideas</text><text start="1421.79" dur="1.62">of what people wanna do in VR</text><text start="1423.41" dur="3.75">are so universally well liked and so cool,</text><text start="1427.16" dur="1.89">that means that there&amp;#39;s something here,</text><text start="1429.05" dur="2.37">there&amp;#39;s something that people want,</text><text start="1431.42" dur="1.65">even in this first generation.</text><text start="1433.07" dur="1.32">Now, will all this new attention</text><text start="1434.39" dur="2.46">on VR headsets in general
shine a lot of light</text><text start="1436.85" dur="2.55">on all of the other
much cheaper competitors</text><text start="1439.4" dur="1.68">that you should probably
buy instead of this one,</text><text start="1441.08" dur="2.154">like the $500 Quest 3?</text><text start="1443.234" dur="1.446">Yeah.</text><text start="1444.68" dur="2.55">Now, will all this new developer attention</text><text start="1447.23" dur="3.18">in this VR/AR space bring
a lot of way cooler,</text><text start="1450.41" dur="1.56">way more awesome applications</text><text start="1451.97" dur="2.49">that will rapidly improve
the value proposition</text><text start="1454.46" dur="2.913">of this $3,500 first gen headset?</text><text start="1458.57" dur="1.62">Yeah.</text><text start="1460.19" dur="2.7">Should you go out and buy one of these</text><text start="1462.89" dur="1.32">if you&amp;#39;ve got the money</text><text start="1464.21" dur="2.85">and you saw one or two
really cool looking apps</text><text start="1467.06" dur="2.163">that you wanna try from the videos?</text><text start="1470.36" dur="2.31">Sure, why not? It&amp;#39;s your money.</text><text start="1472.67" dur="3.663">But I&amp;#39;m already very excited
for the next generation.</text><text start="1477.41" dur="1">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="1479.96" dur="2.193">Catch you guys in the next one, peace.</text><text start="1482.994" dur="2.583">(bright music)</text></transcript>
