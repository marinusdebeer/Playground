<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="1.156" dur="2.667">(upbeat music)</text><text start="14.74" dur="3.65">- All right, so this is Apple&amp;#39;s brand new,</text><text start="18.39" dur="2.73">latest and greatest iPhone 15.</text><text start="21.12" dur="2.67">And nothing inside is new</text><text start="23.79" dur="1.65">or anything that we haven&amp;#39;t seen before</text><text start="25.44" dur="1.59">in some other phone somewhere.</text><text start="27.03" dur="2.49">Now that doesn&amp;#39;t mean
it&amp;#39;s not a good phone.</text><text start="29.52" dur="3.84">You can actually be a really
good phone and not really new,</text><text start="33.36" dur="1.708">they aren&amp;#39;t mutually exclusive.</text><text start="35.068" dur="1.532">And it turns out,</text><text start="36.6" dur="3.39">that is actually Apple&amp;#39;s
strategy with this phone.</text><text start="39.99" dur="0.87">The more I use this phone,</text><text start="40.86" dur="2.25">the more I see Apple&amp;#39;s textbook,</text><text start="43.11" dur="3.27">late mover advantage strategy
coming into play here.</text><text start="46.38" dur="0.96">They&amp;#39;re gonna take something</text><text start="47.34" dur="2.82">we&amp;#39;ve literally already seen before</text><text start="50.16" dur="2.19">and then do it the Apple way.</text><text start="52.35" dur="1.35">So on the outside, let&amp;#39;s see,</text><text start="53.7" dur="3.21">how would I describe
this new phone&amp;#39;s design?</text><text start="56.91" dur="1.71">Kind of familiar, I don&amp;#39;t know,</text><text start="58.62" dur="2.37">somewhat reminiscent of the 14.</text><text start="60.99" dur="1.89">How does Apple say it?</text><text start="62.88" dur="4.767">- iPhone 15 has an all new
design that&amp;#39;s simply gorgeous.</text><text start="67.647" dur="2.193">- All new?</text><text start="69.84" dur="2.043">All new? Really?</text><text start="73.32" dur="1.65">Okay, I mean, I don&amp;#39;t know about all new</text><text start="74.97" dur="3.24">but this phone definitely
inherits the same looks</text><text start="78.21" dur="2.64">and general design as last year again.</text><text start="80.85" dur="1.32">But you know what&amp;#39;s at least partially new</text><text start="82.17" dur="1.47">is actually the way it feels in the hand.</text><text start="83.64" dur="1.62">So I said this in the 15 Pro review,</text><text start="85.26" dur="2.61">but they&amp;#39;ve done a good job
softening the corners here.</text><text start="87.87" dur="3.48">So it still looks boxy,
still has aluminum rails,</text><text start="91.35" dur="1.38">but it&amp;#39;s more comfortable to hold,</text><text start="92.73" dur="1.83">since these corners aren&amp;#39;t as sharp,</text><text start="94.56" dur="1.5">they&amp;#39;re a little bit rounded off.</text><text start="96.06" dur="2.67">And then, this is also
the first glass-backed,</text><text start="98.73" dur="3.24">non-Pro iPhone with a satin back,</text><text start="101.97" dur="1.83">and I am loving the satin back,</text><text start="103.8" dur="3.84">this is like a nice, soft
touch, frosted glass back here.</text><text start="107.64" dur="2.31">I know there&amp;#39;s a super
complicated process too</text><text start="109.95" dur="3.24">to like get this single
piece of glass on the back</text><text start="113.19" dur="1.68">to be two different colors</text><text start="114.87" dur="1.86">and two different
thicknesses and all that,</text><text start="116.73" dur="2.25">and I can totally respect it.</text><text start="118.98" dur="3.27">But honestly, the colors,
they are super weak.</text><text start="122.25" dur="0.867">People were saying in the last video</text><text start="123.117" dur="1.803">the the color grading must be off,</text><text start="124.92" dur="1.62">it looks like it&amp;#39;s white instead of blue.</text><text start="126.54" dur="3.45">No, this blue phone really
doesn&amp;#39;t look that blue at all</text><text start="129.99" dur="2.64">in almost any lighting, it&amp;#39;s like 1% blue.</text><text start="132.63" dur="1.5">But either way, you can say between</text><text start="134.13" dur="2.31">the aluminum and the pale light colors,</text><text start="136.44" dur="1.29">these are also probably</text><text start="137.73" dur="2.82">the most fingerprint
resistant iPhones in years.</text><text start="140.55" dur="1.95">On the sides, same button placements,</text><text start="142.5" dur="2.61">same speakers placements,
same mute switch,</text><text start="145.11" dur="1.95">no action button on this phone.</text><text start="147.06" dur="1.47">Honestly, you could probably use</text><text start="148.53" dur="3.42">an iPhone 14 case on the iPhone 15.</text><text start="151.95" dur="2.58">But around the front, new screen,</text><text start="154.53" dur="4.8">well, not new, again, but new
to this iPhone, new screen.</text><text start="159.33" dur="1.616">You now get the dynamic island</text><text start="160.946" dur="2.104">on the non-Pro iPhones this year,</text><text start="163.05" dur="1.53">which is very much doing</text><text start="164.58" dur="1.89">the whole punch cutout the Apple way.</text><text start="166.47" dur="2.16">So the notch is finally dead</text><text start="168.63" dur="3.75">until maybe a new iPhone SE
brings it back, it could happen.</text><text start="172.38" dur="2.94">But also, slowly, app developers
have been getting on board</text><text start="175.32" dur="1.867">in useful ways over the past year.</text><text start="177.187" dur="1.673">I already have a few favorites now,</text><text start="178.86" dur="2.88">my airline app&amp;#39;s giving
me real-time flight info,</text><text start="181.74" dur="2.94">my weather apps, Uber, et cetera.</text><text start="184.68" dur="0.99">But while we&amp;#39;re up here</text><text start="185.67" dur="2.28">talking about the screen on
this phone, it&amp;#39;s also brighter,</text><text start="187.95" dur="3.78">It&amp;#39;s up to 2,000 knits now,
which looks awesome outdoors.</text><text start="191.73" dur="3.72">But also, it&amp;#39;s 2023,</text><text start="195.45" dur="5">and this is an $800 phone that
still has a 60 hertz display.</text><text start="201.48" dur="3.39">This is actually really fascinating to me.</text><text start="204.87" dur="0.84">It&amp;#39;s so odd.</text><text start="205.71" dur="0.833">Like, on one hand,</text><text start="206.543" dur="2.407">for most people buying this
phone, it&amp;#39;s totally fine.</text><text start="208.95" dur="2.67">It literally doesn&amp;#39;t have,
it&amp;#39;s a new baseline iPhone,</text><text start="211.62" dur="4.32">have you talked to someone who
buys a new baseline iPhone?</text><text start="215.94" dur="1.02">They literally don&amp;#39;t care.</text><text start="216.96" dur="0.99">It doesn&amp;#39;t matter,</text><text start="217.95" dur="1.29">it&amp;#39;s not something they pay attention to,</text><text start="219.24" dur="0.84">you could ask them right now</text><text start="220.08" dur="1.71">how many frames per second their phone is</text><text start="221.79" dur="2.16">and they wouldn&amp;#39;t have an
answer, just doesn&amp;#39;t matter.</text><text start="223.95" dur="1.05">So just as long as it works</text><text start="225" dur="2.31">and it&amp;#39;s all relatively
smooth like last year</text><text start="227.31" dur="1.83">and the year before and the year before,</text><text start="229.14" dur="1.98">it&amp;#39;s totally a non-factor.</text><text start="231.12" dur="3.63">I have actually literally
handed 120 hertz phone to people</text><text start="234.75" dur="2.01">next to a 60 hertz phone,</text><text start="236.76" dur="2.25">and even side by side next to each other,</text><text start="239.01" dur="1.47">they can&amp;#39;t see the difference.</text><text start="240.48" dur="1.47">Or if they do, it&amp;#39;s just like,</text><text start="241.95" dur="2.25">oh, that&amp;#39;s a subtle thing
that seems kind of neat</text><text start="244.2" dur="2.07">but they&amp;#39;d be totally
fine missing out on it.</text><text start="246.27" dur="1.56">So with the target
demographic of this phone,</text><text start="247.83" dur="0.9">it&amp;#39;s totally fine.</text><text start="250.2" dur="3.03">But on the other hand, Apple,</text><text start="253.23" dur="3.54">the richest technology
company in the world,</text><text start="256.77" dur="2.79">does stuff all the time</text><text start="259.56" dur="2.94">that regular people will
literally never notice,</text><text start="262.5" dur="2.79">that are subtle improvements
or changes here and there,</text><text start="265.29" dur="0.833">all the time.</text><text start="266.123" dur="1.747">Like, when they switched
these baseline iPhones</text><text start="267.87" dur="2.43">from LCD to OLED displays,</text><text start="270.3" dur="2.19">do you think any of these
people actually noticed that?</text><text start="272.49" dur="2.22">Or what about going from
the A15 Bionic last year</text><text start="274.71" dur="1.44">to this A16 Bionic?</text><text start="276.15" dur="2.16">Do you think people are actually noticing</text><text start="278.31" dur="0.9">the differences here?</text><text start="279.21" dur="2.94">Or what about when they
just added 5G to the iPhone</text><text start="282.15" dur="2.19">and most people didn&amp;#39;t care?</text><text start="284.34" dur="2.4">Like, making subtle improvements over time</text><text start="286.74" dur="2.7">is what modern smartphones
are all about these days.</text><text start="289.44" dur="1.23">And I would actually argue that</text><text start="290.67" dur="2.13">a higher refresh rate is more noticeable</text><text start="292.8" dur="2.88">to more people than some
of those other things.</text><text start="295.68" dur="3.06">Like, I think you could today
hand me, a professional,</text><text start="298.74" dur="4.08">an unlabeled iPhone with an
A15 Bionic and an A16 Bionic,</text><text start="302.82" dur="2.04">and it would take me quite some time</text><text start="304.86" dur="2.4">to find the real differences between them.</text><text start="307.26" dur="1.56">And so, that combined with the fact</text><text start="308.82" dur="3.36">that it&amp;#39;s incredibly cheap
and easy and reasonable</text><text start="312.18" dur="2.43">to get to like at least a 90 hertz phone,</text><text start="314.61" dur="4.507">isn&amp;#39;t the new Moto G is
like 90 hertz at $170</text><text start="320.31" dur="0.84">or something like that?</text><text start="321.15" dur="1.74">Now I&amp;#39;m sure that&amp;#39;s a
horrible looking screen</text><text start="322.89" dur="1.08">compared to this iPhone,</text><text start="323.97" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s 720P with the brightness
of a box of crayons.</text><text start="327.66" dur="3.51">But still they decided
to add that to that phone</text><text start="331.17" dur="2.58">because Motorola knew that
enough people would notice it</text><text start="333.75" dur="2.67">and feel that smoothness difference</text><text start="336.42" dur="2.91">and it&amp;#39;s a higher level
of perceived performance.</text><text start="339.33" dur="1.05">So it&amp;#39;s just wild to me,</text><text start="340.38" dur="2.91">knowing how easy it would
be for Apple to make this</text><text start="343.29" dur="3.78">even a 90 hertz display, but
they just refuse to do it</text><text start="347.07" dur="3.66">because they&amp;#39;ve attached the
word Pro to that feature.</text><text start="350.73" dur="2.94">It&amp;#39;s promotion for the Pro phones.</text><text start="353.67" dur="1.65">And it just strikes me as a tool</text><text start="355.32" dur="2.73">just to sort of continue widening the gap</text><text start="358.05" dur="2.52">as much as they can
between the Pro iPhones</text><text start="360.57" dur="2.49">and the non-Pro iPhones,
and they&amp;#39;re happy to do it,</text><text start="363.06" dur="2.4">even if it makes this iPhone 15</text><text start="365.46" dur="2.7">the most expensive phone in the world</text><text start="368.16" dur="1.32">with a 60 hertz display.</text><text start="369.48" dur="2.28">Anyway, speaking of widening that gap,</text><text start="371.76" dur="3.93">the Pro phones this year also
got a brand new A17 Pro chip</text><text start="375.69" dur="3.84">but this iPhone 15 gets
last year&amp;#39;s A16 Bionic</text><text start="379.53" dur="0.93">from the 14 Pro.</text><text start="380.46" dur="1.77">Honestly, the renaming of the Pro chip</text><text start="382.23" dur="1.23">might be the most interesting part</text><text start="383.46" dur="1.44">because it implies that</text><text start="384.9" dur="2.58">it&amp;#39;s definitely not going to trickle down</text><text start="387.48" dur="2.28">to the baseline phone next year.</text><text start="389.76" dur="1.95">But either way, this A16 bionic here</text><text start="391.71" dur="2.91">is more than good enough
in a phone of this price,</text><text start="394.62" dur="2.82">as far as performance and
handling everyday tasks</text><text start="397.44" dur="3.03">and gaming and flying
around iOS at 60 hertz.</text><text start="400.47" dur="3.24">And the one thing you definitely
can argue for 60 hertz</text><text start="403.71" dur="1.41">would be battery life,</text><text start="405.12" dur="2.37">because despite all the
issues floating around,</text><text start="407.49" dur="2.19">the battery life on these
phones has been pretty good.</text><text start="409.68" dur="0.833">So I don&amp;#39;t know if you saw it,</text><text start="410.513" dur="2.017">but Apple has officially now addressed</text><text start="412.53" dur="2.43">the heat and battery
issues that some people,</text><text start="414.96" dur="3.27">including myself, have been
reporting with these iPhones.</text><text start="418.23" dur="1.74">So an iOS update is coming</text><text start="419.97" dur="2.13">and it seems like some
specific third party apps,</text><text start="422.1" dur="2.1">like Instagram, were also having issues</text><text start="424.2" dur="1.89">and those should be getting updates too.</text><text start="426.09" dur="2.88">But on average, the battery life on my 15</text><text start="428.97" dur="2.963">has been better than my
battery on the 15 Pro.</text><text start="431.933" dur="1.837">And the 15 Plus looks to have</text><text start="433.77" dur="2.1">the best battery life ever on any iPhone,</text><text start="435.87" dur="1.08">which is really promising.</text><text start="436.95" dur="4.35">So that combination of the
A16 Bionic, which is not new,</text><text start="441.3" dur="3.03">and 60 hertz screens, which are not new,</text><text start="444.33" dur="1.29">are giving you great battery life.</text><text start="445.62" dur="2.76">Also, USB-C is definitely not new</text><text start="448.38" dur="3.21">but here it is alongside all
the benefits that come with it,</text><text start="451.59" dur="2.67">from using the same cable
to charge everything,</text><text start="454.26" dur="1.86">to plugging into more accessories,</text><text start="456.12" dur="3.06">like monitors and keyboards
and all kinds of other stuff.</text><text start="459.18" dur="2.43">It is sad that the older chip does mean</text><text start="461.61" dur="1.44">there&amp;#39;s no USB 3 controller</text><text start="463.05" dur="3.03">so there are no USB 3 data
speeds, it&amp;#39;s still slow,</text><text start="466.08" dur="1.53">but honestly, unless you&amp;#39;re using</text><text start="467.61" dur="1.53">the Pro iPhone&amp;#39;s camera features,</text><text start="469.14" dur="1.77">there&amp;#39;s almost nobody
here buying this phone</text><text start="470.91" dur="2.22">that&amp;#39;s gonna actually need
fast data transfer anyway</text><text start="473.13" dur="1.92">so I guess you can give it a pass.</text><text start="475.05" dur="2.58">And they managed to do
it in the Apple way too.</text><text start="477.63" dur="3.42">They color matched the
inside of the USB-C port</text><text start="481.05" dur="2.1">with the color of the
phone, and they actually,</text><text start="483.15" dur="0.833">I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve seen this,</text><text start="483.983" dur="3.817">they print the model
number inside the port.</text><text start="487.8" dur="1.44">So Apple really loves hiding this</text><text start="489.24" dur="1.26">in the most discreet way possible.</text><text start="490.5" dur="1.29">You know, I should really
gives some appreciation</text><text start="491.79" dur="2.79">to some of the clever software
features on the iPhone 15</text><text start="494.58" dur="2.85">because you could actually
consider them new.</text><text start="497.43" dur="2.34">So they added stuff like
an ultra-wideband chip</text><text start="499.77" dur="2.7">so you can find your phone
more easily with an Apple Watch</text><text start="502.47" dur="2.807">or be found on Find My
Friends, that&amp;#39;s new.</text><text start="505.277" dur="2.803">They also added these clever audio effects</text><text start="508.08" dur="2.4">and video effects at an OS level,</text><text start="510.48" dur="1.74">so they work inside of any app.</text><text start="512.22" dur="2.31">So you can be on a phone
call or a video call</text><text start="514.53" dur="1.92">or a Google Meet or Zoom or whatever,</text><text start="516.45" dur="2.91">and flip on the background
noise cancellation</text><text start="519.36" dur="2.91">and it works really shockingly well,</text><text start="522.27" dur="1.35">it&amp;#39;s very, very good.</text><text start="523.62" dur="1.95">So I&amp;#39;m on a phone call with myself,</text><text start="525.57" dur="1.83">this is what it&amp;#39;ll sound
like to be in a room</text><text start="527.4" dur="2.853">with the dishwasher
running, the HVAC going,</text><text start="531.12" dur="1.86">and the sink going right next to me,</text><text start="532.98" dur="1.56">right next to the microphone.</text><text start="534.54" dur="2.25">When I switch the mic from Standard mode</text><text start="536.79" dur="1.713">to Voice Isolation mode,</text><text start="540.69" dur="2.4">even though all the same
noises are still happening,</text><text start="543.09" dur="2.46">it does a much better
job of just picking out</text><text start="545.55" dur="1.86">specifically my voice,</text><text start="547.41" dur="2.97">really smart and it&amp;#39;s genuinely new.</text><text start="550.38" dur="1.95">There&amp;#39;s also some other not so new stuff,</text><text start="552.33" dur="3.12">like they just now added
downloadable offline areas</text><text start="555.45" dur="3.237">to Apple Maps and interactable widgets,</text><text start="558.687" dur="3.423">and they finally added an
80% battery charge limiter</text><text start="562.11" dur="0.9">in the settings.</text><text start="563.01" dur="1.53">So you can check out all this stuff,</text><text start="564.54" dur="2.82">I did a full video on the iOS 17 update</text><text start="567.36" dur="1.32">at the link below that like button,</text><text start="568.68" dur="1.98">if you wanna watch that, you
should definitely check it out</text><text start="570.66" dur="1.32">after you watch this video.</text><text start="571.98" dur="2.01">What I will say is one of
the most liked features</text><text start="573.99" dur="2.76">I talked about in that
video is Standby mode.</text><text start="576.75" dur="2.01">And on the Pro iPhone, when
you put it on a charger,</text><text start="578.76" dur="2.52">turn it sideways, it keeps the screen on</text><text start="581.28" dur="3.06">which it can do because
it goes to one Hertz,</text><text start="584.34" dur="3.03">it&amp;#39;s an LTPO display, and it&amp;#39;s
fine staying on like that.</text><text start="587.37" dur="3.51">But on the non-Pro iPhone,
which does not have LTPO,</text><text start="590.88" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s basically locked at I
think either 30 or 60 hertz,</text><text start="594.6" dur="2.43">either way it doesn&amp;#39;t drop to one Hertz.</text><text start="597.03" dur="1.77">So Apple just decides,</text><text start="598.8" dur="2.37">we&amp;#39;ll turn off the screen
after a little bit,</text><text start="601.17" dur="0.833">which kind of feels like it</text><text start="602.003" dur="1.297">defeats the purpose of this feature,</text><text start="603.3" dur="2.7">so then you have to nudge the
table or or bump the stand</text><text start="606" dur="2.25">to wake it up like an Apple Watch charger.</text><text start="608.25" dur="1.2">Just a notable difference</text><text start="609.45" dur="2.424">between the Pro and non-Pro iPhones.</text><text start="611.874" dur="1.686">But last but not least,</text><text start="613.56" dur="5">these new cameras are actually
weird, but in a good way.</text><text start="618.6" dur="2.1">So iPhone 15 has been upgraded</text><text start="620.7" dur="2.52">to a new set of 12 megapixel ultra wide</text><text start="623.22" dur="2.82">and the new 48 megapixel main camera.</text><text start="626.04" dur="1.47">It&amp;#39;s not the same sensor as the Pro,</text><text start="627.51" dur="1.14">it&amp;#39;s actually slightly smaller,</text><text start="628.65" dur="3.96">but it has a larger max aperture
of F1.6 to make up for it.</text><text start="632.61" dur="2.25">And then, it&amp;#39;s also
doing a combo of binning</text><text start="634.86" dur="1.5">and detailed transfer to give you</text><text start="636.36" dur="4.14">this new 24 megapixel photo
as a result by default.</text><text start="640.5" dur="1.62">Now, if you were paying attention before,</text><text start="642.12" dur="1.95">you&amp;#39;ll remember that this new iPhone</text><text start="644.07" dur="3.9">has the exact same chip
as last year&amp;#39;s Pro iPhone.</text><text start="647.97" dur="3.57">Same processing cores, same
image signal processor,</text><text start="651.54" dur="3.6">same neural engine, same
A16 Bionic, same everything.</text><text start="655.14" dur="3.47">So why is this new 24 megapixel default</text><text start="658.61" dur="5">only coming to the newest iPhone
15 and not last year&amp;#39;s Pro?</text><text start="663.81" dur="1.71">Like, I still have last year&amp;#39;s Pro phone</text><text start="665.52" dur="1.56">and I&amp;#39;ve updated it to the latest software</text><text start="667.08" dur="1.53">and it does not get this feature,</text><text start="668.61" dur="1.74">it&amp;#39;s still shooting 12 megapixels.</text><text start="670.35" dur="4.11">So honestly now my base iPhone
15&amp;#39;s non-zoomed in photos</text><text start="674.46" dur="1.8">are actually looking a little better,</text><text start="676.26" dur="2.85">a little more detailed than
last year&amp;#39;s Pro phones.</text><text start="679.11" dur="1.89">And then, there&amp;#39;s the new</text><text start="681" dur="3.33">auto-Portrait Mode detection
feature, which is pretty sweet.</text><text start="684.33" dur="2.64">Basically you don&amp;#39;t have
to switch to Portrait Mode</text><text start="686.97" dur="3.12">to take a photo that captures
all of the depth information</text><text start="690.09" dur="2.85">that allows you to turn it into
a Portrait Mode photo later.</text><text start="692.94" dur="3.63">So as long as you&amp;#39;re pointing
the camera at a human subject</text><text start="696.57" dur="4.32">or a cat or a dog as identified
by the neural engine,</text><text start="700.89" dur="3.6">or if you tap to focus, you
automatically get this little F</text><text start="704.49" dur="1.29">at the bottom corner of the screen,</text><text start="705.78" dur="1.56">which means it&amp;#39;s capturing the data needed</text><text start="707.34" dur="2.1">for Portrait Mode, just in case.</text><text start="709.44" dur="1.62">And so, then, later, if you decide,</text><text start="711.06" dur="2.34">eh, I actually do want this
to be a Portrait Mode shot,</text><text start="713.4" dur="1.26">you go into your gallery</text><text start="714.66" dur="2.34">and just make it a Portrait Mode photo,</text><text start="717" dur="2.46">that you can even then go
in and edit and play with.</text><text start="719.46" dur="1.14">Some people have been describing it</text><text start="720.6" dur="2.55">as being able to change
the focus point later.</text><text start="723.15" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s not exactly doing that,</text><text start="724.83" dur="1.77">you can&amp;#39;t like save something</text><text start="726.6" dur="2.25">that was out of focus by bringing it back.</text><text start="728.85" dur="1.92">But basically, for the classic iPhone shot</text><text start="730.77" dur="2.55">where it kind of looks like
everything is in focus,</text><text start="733.32" dur="1.485">then, yeah, you can
play with Portrait Mode</text><text start="734.805" dur="1.635">and get really good results.</text><text start="736.44" dur="2.55">Last year&amp;#39;s Pro iPhone has the same chip,</text><text start="738.99" dur="2.28">also has a 48 megapixel main camera</text><text start="741.27" dur="1.95">and has the same neural engine,</text><text start="743.22" dur="2.758">doesn&amp;#39;t get this feature, for some reason.</text><text start="745.978" dur="1.172">Also kind of weird.</text><text start="747.15" dur="1.56">So look, with these reviews,</text><text start="748.71" dur="1.77">we always make a lot of judgements</text><text start="750.48" dur="4.2">about what we think the
typical iPhone buyer is,</text><text start="754.68" dur="2.85">what they actually care
about, what they&amp;#39;ll notice,</text><text start="757.53" dur="2.73">what they will appreciate
about a new phone.</text><text start="760.26" dur="3.24">And with this one, I do
feel like they&amp;#39;ve stacked up</text><text start="763.5" dur="2.31">enough of these subtle improvements,</text><text start="765.81" dur="1.38">that even though it looks the same</text><text start="767.19" dur="3.09">and there&amp;#39;s not really that
much that&amp;#39;s actually new here,</text><text start="770.28" dur="1.2">they&amp;#39;ve at least stacked enough things</text><text start="771.48" dur="2.22">that it feels like an
appreciably better phone.</text><text start="773.7" dur="3">So my verdict is, if
you have an iPhone 14,</text><text start="776.7" dur="2.76">you don&amp;#39;t have to upgrade,
of course, even a 13 maybe.</text><text start="779.46" dur="1.59">But if you have an older phone</text><text start="781.05" dur="1.74">and you&amp;#39;re looking to
upgrade to a new iPhone,</text><text start="782.79" dur="1.747">every year, I always
get friends asking like,</text><text start="784.537" dur="2.573">&amp;quot;Oh, should I just get the older,</text><text start="787.11" dur="2.67">like last year&amp;#39;s iPhone
to save some money?&amp;quot;</text><text start="789.78" dur="1.08">And no, I actually wouldn&amp;#39;t,</text><text start="790.86" dur="2.25">I would say just get the iPhone 15.</text><text start="793.11" dur="1.14">There&amp;#39;s enough new changes here,</text><text start="794.25" dur="3.12">it&amp;#39;s a better phone in
every way and it&amp;#39;s also USB.</text><text start="797.37" dur="2.1">Like, you don&amp;#39;t buy a base iPhone</text><text start="799.47" dur="1.74">to get the bleeding edge of tech,</text><text start="801.21" dur="1.86">you buy it just &amp;#39;cause
it works and it&amp;#39;s fine</text><text start="803.07" dur="2.228">and it&amp;#39;s gonna be familiar and
work for the next few years.</text><text start="805.298" dur="1.552">And just knowing that you&amp;#39;re gonna have it</text><text start="806.85" dur="0.833">for the next few years,</text><text start="807.683" dur="1.987">I would not recommend
buying a Lightning iPhone</text><text start="809.67" dur="2.46">as we just moved everything forward</text><text start="812.13" dur="2.64">into the world of USB type C.</text><text start="814.77" dur="2.13">Just get the new one, just
grab the boring new iPhone</text><text start="816.9" dur="3.51">with nothing that&amp;#39;s actually that new.</text><text start="820.41" dur="1.47">It&amp;#39;s just gonna work.</text><text start="821.88" dur="3.57">That&amp;#39;s it, thanks for watching,
catch you in the next one.</text><text start="825.45" dur="0.872">Peace.</text><text start="826.322" dur="2.667">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
