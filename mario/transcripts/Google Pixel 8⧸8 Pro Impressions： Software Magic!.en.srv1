<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.06" dur="2.37">- Hey guys, Google had an event today</text><text start="2.43" dur="1.83">where they completely surprised us</text><text start="4.26" dur="2.67">by announcing the totally out of the blue</text><text start="6.93" dur="4.23">Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro,
and the Pixel Watch too</text><text start="11.16" dur="1.92">that somehow never leaked.</text><text start="13.08" dur="2.7">It just completely caught us off guard.</text><text start="15.78" dur="2.52">I hope you can detect my
sarcasm through the internet,</text><text start="18.3" dur="1.53">but hey, we dig an event</text><text start="19.83" dur="1.95">and it has some stuff that I
was really looking forward to,</text><text start="21.78" dur="4.83">Pixel 8 and 8 Pro mostly
because I&amp;#39;ve been a Pixel fan</text><text start="26.61" dur="3.96">even though I know it has these big flaws</text><text start="30.57" dur="2.37">like the Tensor G2 had subpar performance</text><text start="32.94" dur="1.65">and the somewhat average battery life.</text><text start="34.59" dur="2.01">But like I still like the Pixel</text><text start="36.6" dur="1.23">and there&amp;#39;s a lot that
I was looking forward to</text><text start="37.83" dur="1.17">for the next stuff.</text><text start="39" dur="2.31">So, they delivered on a lot of that stuff</text><text start="41.31" dur="1.98">but it also comes with a new price.</text><text start="43.29" dur="2.64">So, okay, on the outside Pixel 8 and 8 Pro</text><text start="45.93" dur="2.22">do still look like Pixels, right?</text><text start="48.15" dur="1.95">I told you they were sticking
with this design language</text><text start="50.1" dur="2.28">with the visor because
it&amp;#39;s very recognizable</text><text start="52.38" dur="1.53">and they finally have that going for them.</text><text start="53.91" dur="1.89">But this year it just feels like</text><text start="55.8" dur="1.8">they rounded everything off</text><text start="57.6" dur="2.85">like that&amp;#39;s the big visible
design update this year,</text><text start="60.45" dur="1.29">everything&amp;#39;s a bit more rounded.</text><text start="61.74" dur="1.41">And then there&amp;#39;s the new colors.</text><text start="63.15" dur="2.01">Now, honestly, I&amp;#39;m just gonna say it.</text><text start="65.16" dur="1.68">I think it&amp;#39;s been a pretty boring year</text><text start="66.84" dur="2.37">for phone colors across the board,</text><text start="69.21" dur="1.26">just putting it out there.</text><text start="70.47" dur="2.49">But with this one it&amp;#39;s Hazel, Rose,</text><text start="72.96" dur="1.68">and Obsidian for the Pixel 8</text><text start="74.64" dur="2.13">and then Obsidian, Porcelain,</text><text start="76.77" dur="1.86">and this new blue color called Bay.</text><text start="78.63" dur="1.56">I think the blue is probably
the most interesting</text><text start="80.19" dur="0.833">of the whole lineup</text><text start="81.023" dur="1.567">combined with the new matte finish</text><text start="82.59" dur="1.5">that&amp;#39;s on the back of all the Pros.</text><text start="84.09" dur="0.96">I love that.</text><text start="85.05" dur="2.7">I think it might be my
favorite alongside Matte Black.</text><text start="87.75" dur="1.26">Maybe it&amp;#39;s a toss up between the two.</text><text start="89.01" dur="1.02">But then around the front</text><text start="90.03" dur="1.92">both displays have actually gotten better.</text><text start="91.95" dur="1.74">So the bezels are a bit thinner</text><text start="93.69" dur="2.07">and they look pretty uniform
all the way around to me.</text><text start="95.76" dur="2.43">And then they&amp;#39;re both
dramatically brighter</text><text start="98.19" dur="3.48">up to 2,000 nits peak
brightness on the Pixel 8</text><text start="101.67" dur="3.21">and 2,400 nits on the 8 Pro.</text><text start="104.88" dur="3">I think that&amp;#39;s the highest
I&amp;#39;ve ever seen in a phone.</text><text start="107.88" dur="1.8">So, I think it should look really good</text><text start="109.68" dur="1.41">both indoors and outdoors.</text><text start="111.09" dur="1.53">And then also the smaller Pixel 8</text><text start="112.62" dur="1.8">is now 120 hertz as well.</text><text start="114.42" dur="0.833">Love that.</text><text start="115.253" dur="2.857">I know people love just
dismissing 120 hertz</text><text start="118.11" dur="2.16">on cheaper phones but we&amp;#39;re there.</text><text start="120.27" dur="1.41">Now it&amp;#39;s not LTPO yet,</text><text start="121.68" dur="1.26">that&amp;#39;s still just the pro.</text><text start="122.94" dur="1.59">But yeah, just looking at these screens</text><text start="124.53" dur="1.41">for the limited time
that I spent with them</text><text start="125.94" dur="2.31">I&amp;#39;m very excited to get
them out in the real world.</text><text start="128.25" dur="2.34">They&amp;#39;re calling it an Actua Display</text><text start="130.59" dur="1.86">and a Super Actua Display.</text><text start="132.45" dur="2.34">Not sure why, but I guess
you gotta name everything.</text><text start="134.79" dur="1.92">But anyway, this year the really big</text><text start="136.71" dur="1.92">physical change we&amp;#39;re
getting with these phones</text><text start="138.63" dur="2.37">I&amp;#39;m gonna say is the new Tensor G3 chip.</text><text start="141" dur="2.79">So, it&amp;#39;s the new third
generation of Google Silicon</text><text start="143.79" dur="2.46">paired with eight gigs
of RAM on the Pixel 8</text><text start="146.25" dur="2.58">and 12 gigs of RAM on the Pixel 8 Pro.</text><text start="148.83" dur="3.51">And to be honest, Google didn&amp;#39;t
really talk that much about,</text><text start="152.34" dur="1.38">or at least flex very much</text><text start="153.72" dur="3.09">of like just raw performance improvements.</text><text start="156.81" dur="1.32">Like it&amp;#39;s not really about that.</text><text start="158.13" dur="1.32">I&amp;#39;m gonna have to test these phones</text><text start="159.45" dur="1.8">to see if they actually improved a lot</text><text start="161.25" dur="3.45">as far as CPU and GPU,
and just overall power.</text><text start="164.7" dur="1.59">So definitely get subscribed
to be first to see</text><text start="166.29" dur="1.71">those reviews when they come out.</text><text start="168" dur="3.21">Also here are the battery sizes,</text><text start="171.21" dur="1.62">the new batteries of these new phones.</text><text start="172.83" dur="3.15">They&amp;#39;re both a tiny bit
bigger than last year.</text><text start="175.98" dur="2.31">But really the story with the Tensor G3</text><text start="178.29" dur="1.59">is there is way more TPU</text><text start="179.88" dur="3.03">and way more processing
power for AI-related tasks</text><text start="182.91" dur="2.46">and that checks out
because the Pixel story</text><text start="185.37" dur="2.64">has always been all about the software,</text><text start="188.01" dur="2.1">and that&amp;#39;s still super true with these.</text><text start="190.11" dur="1.35">There is so much software.</text><text start="191.46" dur="1.71">Like the Pixel is basically</text><text start="193.17" dur="1.86">the smartest smartphone in the room.</text><text start="195.03" dur="3.3">It&amp;#39;s not going to wow
you with amazing numbers</text><text start="198.33" dur="1.74">or incredible build quality,</text><text start="200.07" dur="2.4">or huge hardware features
or anything like that.</text><text start="202.47" dur="0.93">It&amp;#39;s gonna wow you</text><text start="203.4" dur="2.91">with very clever software at every corner.</text><text start="206.31" dur="1.14">So here we&amp;#39;re talking</text><text start="207.45" dur="1.83">there&amp;#39;s a new Google Assistant feature</text><text start="209.28" dur="1.86">where if you&amp;#39;re on a webpage in Chrome</text><text start="211.14" dur="3.87">you can ask the assistant to
summarize the webpage for you</text><text start="215.01" dur="1.26">and then using the same tech,</text><text start="216.27" dur="1.53">I imagine that&amp;#39;s in Google Bard,</text><text start="217.8" dur="2.82">it&amp;#39;ll quickly give you a three
or four bullet point summary</text><text start="220.62" dur="2.22">that&amp;#39;s hopefully accurate.</text><text start="222.84" dur="3.15">A speech-to-text is also now
even faster and more accurate.</text><text start="225.99" dur="1.11">It&amp;#39;s completely on device</text><text start="227.1" dur="2.64">and does a much better
job also at knowing that</text><text start="229.74" dur="3.12">ums and uhs are not part
of your actual sentence,</text><text start="232.86" dur="1.17">so it doesn&amp;#39;t write them down.</text><text start="234.03" dur="0.833">That&amp;#39;s smart.</text><text start="234.863" dur="1.417">They&amp;#39;re doing more stuff
with the front facing camera</text><text start="236.28" dur="1.23">to make stuff like face unlock</text><text start="237.51" dur="2.1">and unlocking stuff in apps more secure.</text><text start="239.61" dur="1.53">There&amp;#39;s also a new fix-it feature</text><text start="241.14" dur="2.67">which will proofread your
messages built into the keyboard</text><text start="243.81" dur="2.58">before you send them with things
like grammar and all that.</text><text start="246.39" dur="3.87">One of the crazy ones is
the new call screen voice.</text><text start="250.26" dur="1.11">So if you&amp;#39;ve used a Pixel</text><text start="251.37" dur="1.14">you know about call screen before</text><text start="252.51" dur="1.68">which is you&amp;#39;re getting a
call, it&amp;#39;s an unknown number.</text><text start="254.19" dur="2.16">You just let the Google
Assistant screen the call.</text><text start="256.35" dur="3.66">The new one has a much more human voice</text><text start="260.01" dur="2.97">that I honestly don&amp;#39;t really
know if it&amp;#39;s a robot voice</text><text start="262.98" dur="1.17">or just a recording of a human</text><text start="264.15" dur="2.01">but it&amp;#39;s much more human sounding.</text><text start="266.16" dur="3.42">And then also it has the chips that pop up</text><text start="269.58" dur="2.25">that you can hit to respond to people</text><text start="271.83" dur="1.32">that are now context aware.</text><text start="273.15" dur="3.27">So if it listens to somebody
say, &amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;#39;m a UPS driver.&amp;quot;</text><text start="276.42" dur="1.807">You can now hit a button
that immediately says,</text><text start="278.227" dur="2.303">&amp;quot;Oh, you can leave the
package at the doorstep.&amp;quot;</text><text start="280.53" dur="1.59">I got to record this.</text><text start="282.12" dur="1.33">I&amp;#39;ll just let you listen to it.</text><text start="283.45" dur="0.89">- [Google Assistant]
Hi, I&amp;#39;m a Google Virtual</text><text start="284.34" dur="1.38">Calling Assistant recording this call</text><text start="285.72" dur="1.53">on behalf of the person
you&amp;#39;re trying to reach.</text><text start="287.25" dur="2.7">Can you say what you&amp;#39;re calling about?</text><text start="289.95" dur="2.962">- [Courier] I&amp;#39;m trying to
drop off a package for Kenny.</text><text start="292.912" dur="2.333">(no audio)</text><text start="297.277" dur="0.893">- [Google Assistant] They
said you can go ahead</text><text start="298.17" dur="2.033">and leave the package by the front door.</text><text start="300.203" dur="1.807">(no audio)</text><text start="302.01" dur="0.833">- [Courier] Okay, thanks.</text><text start="302.843" dur="1.075">That&amp;#39;s great.</text><text start="303.918" dur="2.333">(no audio)</text><text start="308.505" dur="1.779">- [Google Assistant]
Great, I&amp;#39;ll see you soon.</text><text start="310.284" dur="0.833">(beeps)</text><text start="311.117" dur="1.423">- So yeah, that&amp;#39;s pretty good to me.</text><text start="312.54" dur="2.16">It sounds very human,
but again, I don&amp;#39;t know,</text><text start="314.7" dur="2.58">it could just literally
be a human recording.</text><text start="317.28" dur="2.55">Either way, it says it&amp;#39;s
a virtual assistant.</text><text start="319.83" dur="3.45">But what would a Pixel be
without some camera magic?</text><text start="323.28" dur="2.34">So, let&amp;#39;s just jump into
the new camera stuff</text><text start="325.62" dur="3.36">with the Pixel &amp;#39;cause there&amp;#39;s
a lot of software magic here,</text><text start="328.98" dur="0.99">lot of software magic.</text><text start="329.97" dur="2.04">So the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro now share</text><text start="332.01" dur="3.48">the same upgraded 50
megapixel main camera system.</text><text start="335.49" dur="2.64">Then the 8 also has a
12 megapixel ultra wide</text><text start="338.13" dur="2.07">but the 8 Pro just sends it all the way</text><text start="340.2" dur="2.01">with a 48 megapixel ultra wide</text><text start="342.21" dur="2.82">and a 48 megapixel 5x telephoto.</text><text start="345.03" dur="2.13">And I also really like
the new camera app layout</text><text start="347.16" dur="3.75">which is now separated basically
into photo and video mode.</text><text start="350.91" dur="1.68">And then all the various settings</text><text start="352.59" dur="1.65">and modes are inside of each.</text><text start="354.24" dur="1.77">So I think it makes a
lot of intuitive sense.</text><text start="356.01" dur="1.11">You could just switch to photo</text><text start="357.12" dur="1.5">and then go to a specific photo mode.</text><text start="358.62" dur="1.2">There&amp;#39;s manual controls.</text><text start="359.82" dur="1.8">It&amp;#39;s not the first time I&amp;#39;ve
seen it laid out this way</text><text start="361.62" dur="2.28">but when you get so much
stuff happening in the camera</text><text start="363.9" dur="1.77">you don&amp;#39;t wanna move it out or hide it,</text><text start="365.67" dur="2.4">you just need to sort of
organize it in a capable way.</text><text start="368.07" dur="0.87">I think this does a good job.</text><text start="368.94" dur="4.05">So I&amp;#39;ll have to save my photo
and video quality analysis</text><text start="372.99" dur="0.96">for the full review.</text><text start="373.95" dur="2.76">But like I said, there&amp;#39;s
a lot of software features</text><text start="376.71" dur="1.11">that they&amp;#39;ve added that just seem,</text><text start="377.82" dur="2.7">they just get more and
more wild as you go on.</text><text start="380.52" dur="3.36">So the really insane
one is the Magic Editor.</text><text start="383.88" dur="1.11">So you&amp;#39;ve probably already seen,</text><text start="384.99" dur="2.25">you can erase people from
the background of photos</text><text start="387.24" dur="1.44">with Magic Eraser</text><text start="388.68" dur="3.09">but now this Magic Editor
will let you straight up</text><text start="391.77" dur="3.03">select subjects and just move them around,</text><text start="394.8" dur="3.54">and completely alter the entire
photo with just a few taps.</text><text start="398.34" dur="2.28">So they showed me this example
of like moving a subject</text><text start="400.62" dur="1.74">to a different spot in
a photo on the beach</text><text start="402.36" dur="1.44">but there&amp;#39;s also all kinds of other demos</text><text start="403.8" dur="1.5">of like changing the sky</text><text start="405.3" dur="3.36">or changing shadows or
all kinds of other stuff.</text><text start="408.66" dur="2.13">Honestly, it seems like
nothing is off limits.</text><text start="410.79" dur="2.19">And then there&amp;#39;s also a
feature I didn&amp;#39;t get footage of</text><text start="412.98" dur="2.01">but it&amp;#39;s called Best Take,</text><text start="414.99" dur="1.8">which is like when you&amp;#39;re taking a photo</text><text start="416.79" dur="2.25">of like a group of a bunch of people</text><text start="419.04" dur="1.14">and you&amp;#39;re like, &amp;quot;All right everybody,</text><text start="420.18" dur="1.86">try to smile at the same time.&amp;quot;</text><text start="422.04" dur="1.68">And you take a bunch of photos</text><text start="423.72" dur="2.04">but there&amp;#39;s always somebody
blinking in one of them.</text><text start="425.76" dur="2.55">It&amp;#39;s never perfect with everyone&amp;#39;s faces.</text><text start="428.31" dur="1.14">You probably see where this is going.</text><text start="429.45" dur="3.21">So Google detects that
you&amp;#39;re taking a burst photo</text><text start="432.66" dur="1.2">of a bunch of people</text><text start="433.86" dur="1.68">and it will take all of those together,</text><text start="435.54" dur="3.48">and give you the ability
to tap on people&amp;#39;s faces</text><text start="439.02" dur="2.28">and change them to a different instance</text><text start="441.3" dur="2.4">of a different face that they&amp;#39;re
making at a different time</text><text start="443.7" dur="3">just to stitch together
this Frankenstein photo</text><text start="446.7" dur="2.28">with everyone having perfect faces</text><text start="448.98" dur="2.43">even though it&amp;#39;s a moment
that never happened.</text><text start="451.41" dur="1.17">What is a photo? (chuckles)</text><text start="452.58" dur="3.42">But then there&amp;#39;s another
one called Audio Eraser.</text><text start="456" dur="1.2">It&amp;#39;s a video editing feature.</text><text start="457.2" dur="1.86">It&amp;#39;s just on the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro</text><text start="459.06" dur="1.32">but you can actually use it</text><text start="460.38" dur="2.76">on any video you&amp;#39;ve ever
taken in your library.</text><text start="463.14" dur="2.28">But that literally just
erases background sounds</text><text start="465.42" dur="1.89">from like a video of a subject.</text><text start="467.31" dur="1.17">It supposedly works really well,</text><text start="468.48" dur="1.26">I gotta test this on more stuff</text><text start="469.74" dur="1.74">but the one they showed
me worked amazingly well.</text><text start="471.48" dur="1.98">And all of this is
basically along the theme of</text><text start="473.46" dur="3.96">awesome software magic
enabled by Tensor G3.</text><text start="477.42" dur="2.01">Like all of the neural cores</text><text start="479.43" dur="2.82">and all the things that it&amp;#39;s
doing with AI processing</text><text start="482.25" dur="2.49">is what&amp;#39;s enabling all of this awesome,</text><text start="484.74" dur="2.88">weird, fancy software magic stuff.</text><text start="487.62" dur="1.17">And then there&amp;#39;s two other little things</text><text start="488.79" dur="1.92">that didn&amp;#39;t really fit
into the rest of this video</text><text start="490.71" dur="3.42">but one is there&amp;#39;s a new hole
on the back of the Pro phone</text><text start="494.13" dur="0.99">as you could probably see,</text><text start="495.12" dur="2.94">and that is a temperature sensor.</text><text start="498.06" dur="0.84">Yeah.</text><text start="498.9" dur="0.87">Actually.</text><text start="499.77" dur="2.64">So, there&amp;#39;s a new
thermometer app on the phone</text><text start="502.41" dur="3.15">and when you open it, it
asks you to select a material</text><text start="505.56" dur="1.86">to measure the surface temperature of</text><text start="507.42" dur="1.38">I guess to be the most accurate.</text><text start="508.8" dur="1.17">So you pick your material</text><text start="509.97" dur="2.46">and then you just get
up close to your subject</text><text start="512.43" dur="3.15">like within two inches
of it and tap to measure,</text><text start="515.58" dur="3.24">and you get your temperature,
which is it works.</text><text start="518.82" dur="1.11">It&amp;#39;s pretty neat I guess.</text><text start="519.93" dur="2.55">I don&amp;#39;t know that I
would use this very much.</text><text start="522.48" dur="2.94">You may also notice
that humans are missing</text><text start="525.42" dur="1.92">from the object selection menu</text><text start="527.34" dur="1.68">because measuring human temperature</text><text start="529.02" dur="2.04">is still awaiting FDA approval.</text><text start="531.06" dur="1.41">Maybe that&amp;#39;ll get added to the menu</text><text start="532.47" dur="1.56">when it gets approved later this year.</text><text start="534.03" dur="0.84">Although I guess technically</text><text start="534.87" dur="2.49">you could just tell it you&amp;#39;re a ceramic</text><text start="537.36" dur="1.32">or like a hot liquid or something</text><text start="538.68" dur="1.05">and measure yourself anyway.</text><text start="539.73" dur="0.84">I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="540.57" dur="1.59">Whatever.</text><text start="542.16" dur="2.34">There&amp;#39;s a temperature
sensor now on the 8 Pro.</text><text start="544.5" dur="3.63">And but the other thing is
number two, the haptics.</text><text start="548.13" dur="1.89">Oh my god, I was typing on these phones</text><text start="550.02" dur="2.43">and this is like the
number one thing I noticed</text><text start="552.45" dur="3.42">on the 8 Pro is the haptics
are so much stronger.</text><text start="555.87" dur="1.53">I mean I was just poking around the UI</text><text start="557.4" dur="2.55">and scrolling a bunch, but
especially when I was typing,</text><text start="559.95" dur="3.6">the haptics are super
strong and really refined.</text><text start="563.55" dur="1.74">So there&amp;#39;s a difference
between strong haptics</text><text start="565.29" dur="1.71">and like clean, refined haptics.</text><text start="567" dur="3.24">This was both and I think
that&amp;#39;s super underrated.</text><text start="570.24" dur="1.41">I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re gonna mention this</text><text start="571.65" dur="1.53">or put it in the
marketing materials at all</text><text start="573.18" dur="2.01">but I just love the haptics</text><text start="575.19" dur="2.4">from the hour or two that
I spent with this phone.</text><text start="577.59" dur="1.14">All right, quick interjection.</text><text start="578.73" dur="1.11">There&amp;#39;s actually one more thing</text><text start="579.84" dur="1.08">I wanted to mention with these</text><text start="580.92" dur="2.79">that&amp;#39;s called Video Boost</text><text start="583.71" dur="1.47">and it&amp;#39;s one of the weirdest,</text><text start="585.18" dur="0.9">I don&amp;#39;t even know if I can call it</text><text start="586.08" dur="1.14">a software feature actually</text><text start="587.22" dur="1.26">but it&amp;#39;s one of the weirdest things yet.</text><text start="588.48" dur="3.48">So first of all, it&amp;#39;s only
available on the Pro Pixel.</text><text start="591.96" dur="2.52">Second of all, it doesn&amp;#39;t
actually launch with the phone.</text><text start="594.48" dur="2.49">It&amp;#39;s coming soon or later.</text><text start="596.97" dur="1.26">But basically what it is is</text><text start="598.23" dur="2.46">you take some video on your Pixel</text><text start="600.69" dur="2.4">and it looks okay at first</text><text start="603.09" dur="3.42">but then you have it uploaded to the cloud</text><text start="606.51" dur="3.54">where it then processes
overnight or for a few hours</text><text start="610.05" dur="2.46">and then comes back to you with a result</text><text start="612.51" dur="1.56">that looks dramatically better,</text><text start="614.07" dur="2.25">better HDR plus better color grading,</text><text start="616.32" dur="2.58">and looks much better than
the video you originally took.</text><text start="618.9" dur="2.16">I don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s
only on the Pro phone.</text><text start="621.06" dur="1.95">I don&amp;#39;t know why it has to
upload to other servers.</text><text start="623.01" dur="1.11">I don&amp;#39;t even know what&amp;#39;s happening.</text><text start="624.12" dur="1.65">It&amp;#39;s just this weird video magic feature.</text><text start="625.77" dur="1.74">It&amp;#39;s called Video Boost.</text><text start="627.51" dur="1.68">We&amp;#39;ll see what happens
if it actually comes out</text><text start="629.19" dur="3">by review time but just
wanted to throw that in there.</text><text start="632.19" dur="1.56">Another weird feature.</text><text start="633.75" dur="1.47">So then the new prices.</text><text start="635.22" dur="4.11">So, Pixel 8 is gonna start at 699</text><text start="639.33" dur="1.47">which is a hundred bucks
more than last year.</text><text start="640.8" dur="3.3">And then the Pixel 8 Pro
is gonna start at 999.</text><text start="644.1" dur="1.62">I think you can justify it though.</text><text start="645.72" dur="3.66">I mean the base Pixel just got
upgraded to 120 Hertz display</text><text start="649.38" dur="2.7">to a much brighter display
with thinner bezels,</text><text start="652.08" dur="2.85">to the Tensor G3 that&amp;#39;s
got a new primary camera</text><text start="654.93" dur="2.19">that&amp;#39;s the same as a more expensive phone.</text><text start="657.12" dur="2.61">So I still feel like
that&amp;#39;s a fair price for it</text><text start="659.73" dur="1.71">even though it&amp;#39;s not
the bargain of the year</text><text start="661.44" dur="1.02">like it was before.</text><text start="662.46" dur="1.29">And then the other massive update</text><text start="663.75" dur="2.88">that&amp;#39;s for both of these
phones, this is awesome,</text><text start="666.63" dur="5">is seven years of OS security
and feature drop updates</text><text start="672.63" dur="1.17">for the 8 and 8 Pro.</text><text start="673.8" dur="3.51">Seven years which seems
like something they</text><text start="677.31" dur="1.95">probably should have already been doing</text><text start="679.26" dur="2.58">with Google&amp;#39;s own phone
running Google&amp;#39;s own chips</text><text start="681.84" dur="1.53">and Google&amp;#39;s own software.</text><text start="683.37" dur="1.62">But yeah, that&amp;#39;s, think about that.</text><text start="684.99" dur="0.93">That&amp;#39;s pretty sick.</text><text start="685.92" dur="0.93">They&amp;#39;re leading the way.</text><text start="686.85" dur="0.96">This is a phone that&amp;#39;s gonna get</text><text start="687.81" dur="4.41">its last software update
in 2030. (snaps fingers)</text><text start="692.22" dur="0.9">Good looks, Google.</text><text start="693.12" dur="1.32">But also, yeah, they announced an update</text><text start="694.44" dur="1.59">to the Pixel Watch 2.</text><text start="696.03" dur="2.79">It is in the same super
sleek pebble design</text><text start="698.82" dur="1.95">so it&amp;#39;s gonna look the
same from the outside.</text><text start="700.77" dur="3.09">But now inside there&amp;#39;s a
new quad core processor</text><text start="703.86" dur="2.01">that should speed things up significantly</text><text start="705.87" dur="2.04">and also potentially
extend the battery life</text><text start="707.91" dur="2.34">by a little bit &amp;#39;cause
they&amp;#39;re promising 24 hours</text><text start="710.25" dur="3.39">but with always on display
on now instead of off.</text><text start="713.64" dur="1.86">And there&amp;#39;s a bunch of
newly redesigned apps</text><text start="715.5" dur="1.5">like Gmail and calendar.</text><text start="717" dur="1.8">And then it just felt like
they added a bunch of stuff</text><text start="718.8" dur="3.03">that we also recently saw
added to the Apple Watch.</text><text start="721.83" dur="3.21">So there&amp;#39;s a new safety
check feature that works</text><text start="725.04" dur="2.19">almost exactly like the
one Apple just announced.</text><text start="727.23" dur="2.49">They also added a skin temperature sensor</text><text start="729.72" dur="2.04">that can be helpful for
monitoring patterns.</text><text start="731.76" dur="3.96">They also now have auto workout
start and stop detection</text><text start="735.72" dur="2.01">and they also added backup and restore,</text><text start="737.73" dur="2.25">which actually other
watches have had for a while</text><text start="739.98" dur="1.17">and they should have had this ages ago</text><text start="741.15" dur="1.47">but they also now have that.</text><text start="742.62" dur="1.26">If you look at the back of the watch,</text><text start="743.88" dur="1.44">there&amp;#39;s a bunch of improved sensors</text><text start="745.32" dur="2.46">that should better monitor
heart rate and health data</text><text start="747.78" dur="2.46">while you&amp;#39;re moving around
a lot more vigorously.</text><text start="750.24" dur="0.84">And this watch will launch</text><text start="751.08" dur="1.41">at the same price that last year&amp;#39;s did</text><text start="752.49" dur="2.4">so 349 for the wifi only</text><text start="754.89" dur="2.82">and 399 starting for the LTE watch.</text><text start="757.71" dur="1.68">And that&amp;#39;s a pretty
good spot for our segue</text><text start="759.39" dur="1.38">to the sponsor of this video,</text><text start="760.77" dur="1.47">which is the Dbrand Ghost Case.</text><text start="762.24" dur="2.04">They&amp;#39;re gonna make one
for these new Pixels,</text><text start="764.28" dur="1.17">Pixel 8 and 8 Pro,</text><text start="765.45" dur="2.16">so you can see that matte
finish or that new color</text><text start="767.61" dur="1.74">through the case while
keeping it protected</text><text start="769.35" dur="2.73">and that even though it doesn&amp;#39;t
have G2 wireless charging</text><text start="772.08" dur="1.5">like it was rumored that they might,</text><text start="773.58" dur="2.1">that didn&amp;#39;t stop Dbrand from just putting</text><text start="775.68" dur="2.1">a MagSafe compatible
ring on the back anyway.</text><text start="777.78" dur="1.11">And I also kinda like what they did</text><text start="778.89" dur="0.99">with the question mark design</text><text start="779.88" dur="2.61">compared to the classic
Apple MagSafe layout.</text><text start="782.49" dur="1.86">But also I like the fact that Dbrand says</text><text start="784.35" dur="1.86">the Ghost Case will never turn yellow</text><text start="786.21" dur="1.47">unlike every other clear case.</text><text start="787.68" dur="1.47">So, if you wanna pick up a ghost</text><text start="789.15" dur="1.92">which will never turn yellow,
I&amp;#39;ll leave link below.</text><text start="791.07" dur="0.87">And so that&amp;#39;s it.</text><text start="791.94" dur="2.88">Let me know what you guys
wanna see in the reviews</text><text start="794.82" dur="4.32">of each of these devices,
the phones, the watches</text><text start="799.14" dur="2.49">because my name is Marques Brownlee</text><text start="801.63" dur="2.76">and it is Techtober officially</text><text start="804.39" dur="1.83">and there&amp;#39;s gonna be a bunch of videos</text><text start="806.22" dur="0.93">in the next couple weeks.</text><text start="807.15" dur="1.77">So, stay tuned for that stuff.</text><text start="808.92" dur="1.08">Get subscribed.</text><text start="810" dur="2.401">All right, catch you in the next one.</text><text start="812.401" dur="1.052">Peace.</text><text start="813.453" dur="2.667">(uptempo music)</text></transcript>
