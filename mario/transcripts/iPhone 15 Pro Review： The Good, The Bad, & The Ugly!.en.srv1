there actually are.</text><text start="10.05" dur="2.19">Have you ever listened to a car reviewer</text><text start="12.24" dur="3.15">describe the latest
generation Porsche 911?</text><text start="15.39" dur="2.88">Like, this is a car that&amp;#39;s
looked more or less the same</text><text start="18.27" dur="4.11">for the past 50 years
with slight evolutions</text><text start="22.38" dur="1.44">with each new generation.</text><text start="23.82" dur="3.12">And literally, every time
you watch or read a review,</text><text start="26.94" dur="1.717">they always say every single time,</text><text start="28.657" dur="1.193">&amp;quot;Oh, it&amp;#39;s so refined,</text><text start="29.85" dur="2.13">oh, this is an engineering masterpiece</text><text start="31.98" dur="2.138">that&amp;#39;s been perfected over generations.</text><text start="34.118" dur="1.852">It&amp;#39;s a formula that&amp;#39;s been developed</text><text start="35.97" dur="1.86">in the same direction for years.&amp;quot;</text><text start="37.83" dur="0.99">I actually, as a kid,</text><text start="38.82" dur="2.856">I used to actively dislike
Porsches because I just,</text><text start="41.676" dur="1.374">I knew they were expensive,</text><text start="43.05" dur="1.14">but I thought they&amp;#39;re all so boring,</text><text start="44.19" dur="1.2">they all look like the same thing.</text><text start="45.39" dur="2.43">Why would you get one of
those, when you could get</text><text start="47.82" dur="4.386">a way more exciting
Ferrari or McLaren instead?</text><text start="52.206" dur="2.334">But as I&amp;#39;ve gotten older,</text><text start="54.54" dur="4.74">I can appreciate the Porsche
formula a little more.</text><text start="59.28" dur="2.64">I don&amp;#39;t love it or anything,
I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I love it,</text><text start="61.92" dur="4.41">but I can appreciate it
more, does that make sense?</text><text start="66.33" dur="1.2">I hope that makes sense.</text><text start="68.411" dur="0.958">♪ Bling ♪</text><text start="69.369" dur="1.036">♪ I am the one at optimum ♪</text><text start="70.405" dur="1.863">♪ I got the drum, I got the drop on &amp;#39;em ♪</text><text start="72.268" dur="2.034">♪ I got the lock, stock

gotta get this thought</text><text start="109.35" dur="2.82">out of their head that you&amp;#39;ve
gotta upgrade every year</text><text start="112.17" dur="0.93">to the newest phone.</text><text start="113.1" dur="1.56">Like, I realize most of
us already know this,</text><text start="114.66" dur="2.4">but for some reason, people
are still stuck on this thing</text><text start="117.06" dur="2.19">where they say, &amp;quot;Oh, last year&amp;#39;s phone</text><text start="119.25" dur="2.28">is barely different
from this year&amp;#39;s phone,</text><text start="121.53" dur="1.47">it&amp;#39;s not worth upgrading.&amp;quot;</text><text start="123" dur="0.863">But like, that&amp;#39;s not new,</text><text start="123.863" dur="3.097">like the Zenfone 10 I just reviewed</text><text start="126.96" dur="2.43">is just a refinement of Zenfone 9.</text><text start="129.39" dur="1.68">Like the bleeding edge ROG phone</text><text start="131.07" dur="1.71">has looked the same for three years now,</text><text start="132.78" dur="2.1">the Pixel is finding
its stride with design.</text><text start="134.88" dur="1.44">But what we&amp;#39;re really looking for</text><text start="136.32" dur="4.02">is for them to fix anything
that&amp;#39;s wrong or bad,</text><text start="140.34" dur="2.16">and then just find ways, clever ways,</text><text start="142.5" dur="0.96">good, interesting ways</text><text start="143.46" dur="1.74">to just get a little
bit better every year,</text><text start="145.2" dur="4.2">so that over a long time,
over a bunch of improvements,</text><text start="149.4" dur="3.72">it adds up to a bigger,
more significant change.</text><text start="153.12" dur="2.97">So that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening
here with this iPhone 15 Pro.</text><text start="156.09" dur="1.44">I&amp;#39;ve been using it for
about two weeks now.</text><text start="157.53" dur="1.62">They&amp;#39;ve made some improvements,</text><text start="159.15" dur="3.81">but now we&amp;#39;re starting to also
see some possible problems,</text><text start="162.96" dur="4.68">some new issues that have risen
up, so let&amp;#39;s talk about it.</text><text start="167.64" dur="2.28">So there&amp;#39;s basically four new
features they&amp;#39;ve added here.</text><text start="169.92" dur="1.71">I&amp;#39;m gonna go over some
of the more fundamental</text><text start="171.63" dur="3.99">and existential stuff in the
regular iPhone 15 review,</text><text start="175.62" dur="1.35">so definitely make sure you&amp;#39;re subscribed</text><text start="176.97" dur="1.14">to see that when it comes out.</text><text start="178.11" dur="0.833">But for the Pro,</text><text start="178.943" dur="1.387">it&amp;#39;s time to deep dive on the stuff</text><text start="180.33" dur="3.428">that&amp;#39;s unique to this one,
the professional stuff.</text><text start="183.758" dur="2.935">That being the build, the chip,</text><text start="186.693" dur="3.477">the cameras and the Action Button.</text><text start="190.17" dur="1.23">So easiest place to start</text><text start="191.4" dur="1.68">is the way they&amp;#39;ve built this phone.</text><text start="193.08" dur="1.89">So Apple made an update to the build</text><text start="194.97" dur="2.16">and the materials of the iPhone this year,</text><text start="197.13" dur="2.07">they&amp;#39;ve softened the corners a little bit,</text><text start="199.2" dur="1.92">it&amp;#39;s clearly still a boxy
design, but, you know,</text><text start="201.12" dur="2.28">now, instead of a completely
flat glass at the front,</text><text start="203.4" dur="3.09">there&amp;#39;s this gentle little
curve just at the very edges.</text><text start="206.49" dur="1.8">I think that&amp;#39;ll maybe
make screen protectors</text><text start="208.29" dur="1.08">slightly more intricate,</text><text start="209.37" dur="1.5">but I think it has a nice look to it.</text><text start="210.87" dur="2.19">And then the screen sizes
are exactly the same,</text><text start="213.06" dur="2.49">but now the bezels are
actually a tiny bit slimmer</text><text start="215.55" dur="0.833">all the way around.</text><text start="216.383" dur="0.877">So technically the phone</text><text start="217.26" dur="2.97">is like one millimeter smaller diagonally</text><text start="220.23" dur="2.34">and the rails have famously switched from</text><text start="222.57" dur="1.92">that shiny stainless steel</text><text start="224.49" dur="3.18">to a lighter, coated and brushed titanium.</text><text start="227.67" dur="3.54">The result, it&amp;#39;s very
slightly better, I think.</text><text start="231.21" dur="1.23">It&amp;#39;s kind of funny,</text><text start="232.44" dur="2.55">I&amp;#39;ve always associated a heavy phone</text><text start="234.99" dur="3.24">with like expensive feeling, you know?</text><text start="238.23" dur="1.83">Like, the ceramic phones
are like extra heavy,</text><text start="240.06" dur="1.491">they feel like substance.</text><text start="241.551" dur="2.589">But I understand why people
want it to be lighter.</text><text start="244.14" dur="2.1">And so, this phone is
actually noticeably lighter</text><text start="246.24" dur="0.84">than the previous Pro.</text><text start="247.08" dur="3.392">It&amp;#39;s 10% on paper, but it
feels like more than 10%.</text><text start="250.472" dur="1.108">And then, there&amp;#39;s a new set of colors too</text><text start="251.58" dur="1.29">so I&amp;#39;m sticking with it,</text><text start="252.87" dur="2.4">this new natural titanium
is the best color,</text><text start="255.27" dur="2.43">this is the first year I am not ordering</text><text start="257.7" dur="1.68">a dark or black iPhone.</text><text start="259.38" dur="1.647">They still look good, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong,</text><text start="261.027" dur="3.633">but they get all kinds of
fingerprints on them like crazy.</text><text start="264.66" dur="4.29">And also, my worries about
the light colored scratches,</text><text start="268.95" dur="1.05">if you go deep enough,</text><text start="270" dur="2.43">were all confirmed by
Zack, JerryRigEverything,</text><text start="272.43" dur="1.47">in his video cutting the thing up.</text><text start="273.9" dur="2.09">So because I&amp;#39;m on team no case,</text><text start="275.99" dur="1.6">I&amp;#39;m going with the all gray phone,</text><text start="277.59" dur="1.95">I think it looks dope,
so I&amp;#39;m going with that.</text><text start="279.54" dur="1.2">I think basically the idea is,</text><text start="280.74" dur="1.62">if you have a perfectly working phone,</text><text start="282.36" dur="1.77">there&amp;#39;s no world where you
should upgrade to this one</text><text start="284.13" dur="1.35">just for the titanium build</text><text start="285.48" dur="1.98">or just for the slightly thinner bezels.</text><text start="287.46" dur="1.59">But you have to appreciate,</text><text start="289.05" dur="2.52">put this up next to an
iPhone 11, then, yeah,</text><text start="291.57" dur="2.337">you can see the differences
compounding over time.</text><text start="293.907" dur="3.963">Just like if you sat in a
992 generation 911 right now</text><text start="297.87" dur="2.49">after sitting in a 997 generation car.</text><text start="300.36" dur="2.486">But the real highlight of this
build here, let&amp;#39;s be honest,</text><text start="302.846" dur="5">is there&amp;#39;s a new port at
the bottom, that USB type C,</text><text start="307.989" dur="1.791">which makes a big
difference to people like me</text><text start="309.78" dur="2.01">who have other gadgets in their life,</text><text start="311.79" dur="3.15">computers, headphones, mouse, keyboard,</text><text start="314.94" dur="2.28">I just bring one charger,
it works with everything.</text><text start="317.22" dur="3.84">I have already had this rite
of passage moment that everyone</text><text start="321.06" dur="1.02">who gets this phone is gonna have</text><text start="322.08" dur="1.68">where you have an existing Lightning cable</text><text start="323.76" dur="1.59">and you try to plug it
in and then you&amp;#39;re like,</text><text start="325.35" dur="1.732">oh right, new cable.</text><text start="327.082" dur="1.778">But now I&amp;#39;ve gotten used to it.</text><text start="328.86" dur="0.9">But the thing is,</text><text start="329.76" dur="4.02">I could have sworn Apple
would do more with this port.</text><text start="333.78" dur="1.86">Like, okay, we know that</text><text start="335.64" dur="1.98">they were basically forced
into doing this by the EU,</text><text start="337.62" dur="2.1">so shout out to the EU for that.</text><text start="339.72" dur="1.35">Now we have a USB iPhone,</text><text start="341.07" dur="1.53">but like the only pitch is just,</text><text start="342.6" dur="1.792">hey, one cable for everything.</text><text start="344.392" dur="1.628">That&amp;#39;s it, Apple really?</text><text start="346.02" dur="2.7">So like with 30 pin to
Lightning all those years ago,</text><text start="348.72" dur="0.93">the benefit was obvious,</text><text start="349.65" dur="2.55">it&amp;#39;s just so much smaller of a port</text><text start="352.2" dur="2.19">so that let them fit
more stuff in the phone,</text><text start="354.39" dur="1.11">plus it&amp;#39;s reversible now.</text><text start="355.5" dur="2.13">Now with this USB type C, it&amp;#39;s like okay,</text><text start="357.63" dur="2.64">it was already small, it
was already reversible,</text><text start="360.27" dur="3.3">charging speed did not improve
at all, it&amp;#39;s still 25 watts.</text><text start="363.57" dur="2.49">There&amp;#39;s no extra like desktop mode,</text><text start="366.06" dur="1.26">plug it into a monitor and get,</text><text start="367.32" dur="1.74">there&amp;#39;s no decks or
anything like that, right?</text><text start="369.06" dur="2.433">It&amp;#39;s just one cable for everything.</text><text start="372.5" dur="2.77">Okay, fine, sure, welcome to the club.</text><text start="375.27" dur="1.973">You know, iPhone users
can now take advantage</text><text start="377.243" dur="2.283">of the U in USB-C.</text><text start="379.526" dur="2.044">I talked about the handshake it does</text><text start="381.57" dur="2.28">with plugging directly into other phones</text><text start="383.85" dur="2.34">and reverse charging them
at four and a half watts</text><text start="386.19" dur="2.25">in the unboxing video, that&amp;#39;s pretty neat.</text><text start="388.44" dur="1.5">You can also plug in other things,</text><text start="389.94" dur="3.06">plug in a keyboard and type
with it, plug in a monitor,</text><text start="393" dur="2.37">it&amp;#39;ll mirror your screen at up to 4K 60.</text><text start="395.37" dur="1.47">And the Pro phone now supports</text><text start="396.84" dur="2.34">USB 3.0 data transfer speeds</text><text start="399.18" dur="1.89">so you can get that ProRes footage</text><text start="401.07" dur="2.28">off the phone noticeably faster,</text><text start="403.35" dur="1.77">and you can actually, for the first time,</text><text start="405.12" dur="2.7">shoot video directly
onto an external drive.</text><text start="407.82" dur="2.55">Now there&amp;#39;s some talk about the
cable that comes in the box.</text><text start="410.37" dur="2.91">Remember that nice high
quality braided USB-C cable</text><text start="413.28" dur="1.56">that comes in the box?</text><text start="414.84" dur="3.81">But it&amp;#39;s only USB 2.0 transfer
speeds, it&amp;#39;s a slow cable.</text><text start="418.65" dur="0.99">So if you have a Pro phone,</text><text start="419.64" dur="2.19">you need get a faster
separate cable for it?</text><text start="421.83" dur="1.74">That seemed weird to people,</text><text start="423.57" dur="1.404">but it&amp;#39;s not, that&amp;#39;s very normal.</text><text start="424.974" dur="2.016">Most smartphones come with</text><text start="426.99" dur="2.068">just a USB-C cable just to charge.</text><text start="429.058" dur="1.352">It&amp;#39;s a charging cable.</text><text start="430.41" dur="1.26">If you wanted a data cable,</text><text start="431.67" dur="2.43">you&amp;#39;d have to buy a
thicker, more robust cable</text><text start="434.1" dur="3.184">that looks the same but is a data cable.</text><text start="437.284" dur="3.536">It&amp;#39;s kind of confusing
and annoying actually.</text><text start="440.82" dur="2.937">Welcome to the world of USB-C, my friends,</text><text start="443.757" dur="1.203">it&amp;#39;s good to have you.</text><text start="444.96" dur="2.34">But that is a good segue
to the main enabler,</text><text start="447.3" dur="3.75">the new powerhouse chip inside
this phone with a new name,</text><text start="451.05" dur="1.98">the A17 Pro.</text><text start="453.03" dur="1.71">So the base iPhone 15s</text><text start="454.74" dur="2.88">got last year&amp;#39;s A16
bionic from the 14 Pro.</text><text start="457.62" dur="2.76">And so, here&amp;#39;s this new more powerful chip</text><text start="460.38" dur="2.67">in the highest end phones
and it&amp;#39;s not the A17 Bionic,</text><text start="463.05" dur="2.7">this is the first one with
the Pro name, A17 Pro,</text><text start="465.75" dur="2.25">and this thing goes
kind of crazy on paper.</text><text start="468" dur="1.835">This is their first three nanometer chip,</text><text start="469.835" dur="2.215">actually, the first three
nanometer chip in any phone</text><text start="472.05" dur="3.3">that we&amp;#39;ll probably see for
at least another year or two.</text><text start="475.35" dur="1.05">I ran some benchmarks,</text><text start="476.4" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s literally approaching M1 chip levels</text><text start="479.79" dur="2.58">of synthetic benchmark scores,
and compared to last year,</text><text start="482.37" dur="2.31">it&amp;#39;s 10 to 20% more powerful</text><text start="484.68" dur="3.63">on both the CPU and the GPU,
which is very respectable.</text><text start="488.31" dur="4.08">But more power is like
more horsepower in a car.</text><text start="492.39" dur="3.51">It&amp;#39;s only really useful or noticeable</text><text start="495.9" dur="2.13">if it lets you do more things with it.</text><text start="498.03" dur="2.07">I&amp;#39;m gonna live in this analogy
a bit more for a minute,</text><text start="500.1" dur="3.09">but like the last generation
Porsche 911 Turbo S,</text><text start="503.19" dur="3.06">it was already so ballistic fast</text><text start="506.25" dur="2.01">that you never approached that limit</text><text start="508.26" dur="1.32">anywhere on public streets</text><text start="509.58" dur="2.16">until you get to the
highest end of performance,</text><text start="511.74" dur="0.833">on the track.</text><text start="512.573" dur="1.747">And the highest end
iPhone is the same way,</text><text start="514.32" dur="2.07">like, the Pro iPhone&amp;#39;s been great</text><text start="516.39" dur="3.15">at just surfing Instagram and texting</text><text start="519.54" dur="1.86">and doing all the normal web browsing,</text><text start="521.4" dur="2.04">basic stuff you&amp;#39;d do on a phone.</text><text start="523.44" dur="1.68">And so, the only place you&amp;#39;d really notice</text><text start="525.12" dur="4.56">the extra performance is,
well, we got a gaming demo.</text><text start="529.68" dur="2.31">Apple showed these wild demos</text><text start="531.99" dur="2.01">on the new iPhone at the keynote.</text><text start="534" dur="1.44">And just a disclaimer,</text><text start="535.44" dur="1.5">I&amp;#39;m not much of a phone gamer</text><text start="536.94" dur="2.73">so I&amp;#39;ll defer the commentary
on this to Dave2D,</text><text start="539.67" dur="1.83">you can go watch his video, linked below.</text><text start="541.5" dur="3.833">But they literally launched
exclusive games on the iPhone,</text><text start="545.333" dur="2.707">that are like &amp;quot;Resident Evil: Village&amp;quot;</text><text start="548.04" dur="1.56">and &amp;quot;Assassin&amp;#39;s Creed&amp;quot;,</text><text start="549.6" dur="2.01">but not on cut down mobile versions,</text><text start="551.61" dur="3.03">these are literally the same
versions with the same assets</text><text start="554.64" dur="2.61">and same textures and everything</text><text start="557.25" dur="1.367">from the PlayStation version</text><text start="558.617" dur="2.293">&amp;#39;cause it literally is
the PlayStation version.</text><text start="560.91" dur="0.833">That&amp;#39;s impressive.</text><text start="561.743" dur="2.311">Plus you know, performance
headroom is never a bad thing.</text><text start="564.054" dur="2.466">But I think also for me and
for a lot of other people,</text><text start="566.52" dur="1.71">the more impactful things</text><text start="568.23" dur="2.04">that you&amp;#39;ll actually
notice about this new chip</text><text start="570.27" dur="1.74">are in the dedicated parts of it</text><text start="572.01" dur="1.95">that are for specific tasks.</text><text start="573.96" dur="1.77">Like, the new image signal processor</text><text start="575.73" dur="2.34">lets you take really, really fast,</text><text start="578.07" dur="2.22">lag-free photos constantly.</text><text start="580.29" dur="3.21">The new neural engine recognizes
Portrait Mode subjects,</text><text start="583.5" dur="3.69">like people&amp;#39;s faces and
dogs and cats automatically,</text><text start="587.19" dur="1.92">and lets you go back in time</text><text start="589.11" dur="2.456">and set a regular photo
to a Portrait Mode photo.</text><text start="591.566" dur="1.564">The USB 3 controller</text><text start="593.13" dur="2.01">that enables faster data transfer speeds</text><text start="595.14" dur="1.74">is also on the A17 Pro,</text><text start="596.88" dur="1.95">all of that is coming from the new chip.</text><text start="598.83" dur="1.56">But what I&amp;#39;m more concerned with</text><text start="600.39" dur="2.76">at the moment is battery life.</text><text start="603.15" dur="4.11">Okay, so actually, it&amp;#39;s
kind of two main issues</text><text start="607.26" dur="0.84">that have been popping up</text><text start="608.1" dur="1.59">that you kind of have
to try to figure out,</text><text start="609.69" dur="1.68">are they isolated issues</text><text start="611.37" dur="1.77">or are these real problems with the phone?</text><text start="613.14" dur="3.39">And those are battery life
and overheating issues.</text><text start="616.53" dur="1.32">And to be honest, part of the reason</text><text start="617.85" dur="1.74">this review took like longer than normal</text><text start="619.59" dur="2.4">is I&amp;#39;ve been really trying
to dig into the battery</text><text start="621.99" dur="1.62">and figure out what&amp;#39;s going on here.</text><text start="623.61" dur="1.35">So objectively speaking,</text><text start="624.96" dur="3.18">these phones have slightly
bigger batteries than last year</text><text start="628.14" dur="1.68">and a new three nanometer chip.</text><text start="629.82" dur="1.56">So in a controlled environment,</text><text start="631.38" dur="1.86">they should do better and they do,</text><text start="633.24" dur="3.27">they literally last longer on
like simple benchmark stuff.</text><text start="636.51" dur="1.74">So that&amp;#39;s good news.</text><text start="638.25" dur="2.16">Now when I test a phone, like normal,</text><text start="640.41" dur="2.13">I pretty much, I kind of go by feel,</text><text start="642.54" dur="2.64">I always have some mix of good days,</text><text start="645.18" dur="2.73">some average days and then some bad days,</text><text start="647.91" dur="2.01">where I can sort of figure
out what&amp;#39;s draining it,</text><text start="649.92" dur="1.14">what its weaknesses are</text><text start="651.06" dur="1.85">and then I can come to
a conclusion from that.</text><text start="652.91" dur="1.84">So now here we are, I
get a couple days in,</text><text start="654.75" dur="1.53">I get a couple weeks in</text><text start="656.28" dur="2.64">and I&amp;#39;ve had a good
amount of average days,</text><text start="658.92" dur="2.749">I&amp;#39;ve had a couple of
those bad draining days,</text><text start="661.669" dur="3.611">but I also haven&amp;#39;t had
any of those amazing days</text><text start="665.28" dur="2.31">where I get like nine
hours of screen on time.</text><text start="667.59" dur="1.53">I just haven&amp;#39;t had any yet.</text><text start="669.12" dur="1.83">And then, we also started to
see some of those headlines</text><text start="670.95" dur="2.76">about battery life potentially being worse</text><text start="673.71" dur="1.56">and there&amp;#39;s also some overheating issues</text><text start="675.27" dur="2.67">popping up on Twitter or X</text><text start="677.94" dur="2.07">and some people were asking
if mine has had any issues.</text><text start="680.01" dur="1.53">So here&amp;#39;s the weird answer,</text><text start="681.54" dur="2.94">yes, but not when I would expect,</text><text start="684.48" dur="2.34">Two days ago, literally, I
was just at a golf tournament,</text><text start="686.82" dur="2.49">it was in Florida, it was
like 100 degree really feel</text><text start="689.31" dur="0.93">or something crazy like that.</text><text start="690.24" dur="2.1">And I&amp;#39;m outside with my
phone at max brightness</text><text start="692.34" dur="3.33">with GPS going all day out in the sun,</text><text start="695.67" dur="2.28">and it was fine, no problem,
no overheating issues.</text><text start="697.95" dur="1.05">But then, a couple hours later,</text><text start="699" dur="2.85">I&amp;#39;m on the airplane with
my phone in Airplane Mode</text><text start="701.85" dur="2.01">and I&amp;#39;ve got just like
music playing on Bluetooth</text><text start="703.86" dur="2.7">with Spotify and like
scrolling through Instagram,</text><text start="706.56" dur="2.01">and for like five minutes,</text><text start="708.57" dur="1.23">the phone just gets really hot</text><text start="709.8" dur="1.92">and just blasts through like 5% battery,</text><text start="711.72" dur="1.23">and then it&amp;#39;s fine again afterwards,</text><text start="712.95" dur="3.18">and I&amp;#39;m like, there almost
seems to be no rhyme or reason</text><text start="716.13" dur="1.95">why it does this randomly once in a while.</text><text start="718.08" dur="3.6">So my best theory is
that the A17 Pro is just,</text><text start="721.68" dur="1.71">it&amp;#39;s a more powerful
chip and so therefore,</text><text start="723.39" dur="2.49">is able to drain power
more quickly than before</text><text start="725.88" dur="2.673">in high intensity settings,
like gaming, et cetera.</text><text start="728.553" dur="3.477">And there&amp;#39;s also been some
issues attributed to iOS 17 bugs,</text><text start="732.03" dur="2.37">like we&amp;#39;re already on 17.0.2.</text><text start="734.4" dur="1.77">I imagine there&amp;#39;s some more updates coming</text><text start="736.17" dur="3.03">to both iOS and a bunch of apps.</text><text start="739.2" dur="0.833">But by the end of this,</text><text start="740.033" dur="1.807">I kind of feel like I&amp;#39;m
expecting battery life</text><text start="741.84" dur="2.61">to basically even out to
be the same as last year,</text><text start="744.45" dur="2.37">which is a boring answer, but
that&amp;#39;s kind of what I expect.</text><text start="746.82" dur="1.65">Now we can talk all we want</text><text start="748.47" dur="3.99">about what the word Pro
actually means in a smartphone,</text><text start="752.46" dur="3.69">but with iPhones, that
has mostly meant cameras.</text><text start="756.15" dur="2.91">And it turns out there is a lot going on</text><text start="759.06" dur="3.45">with these relatively
similar looking cameras</text><text start="762.51" dur="2.22">on these new Pro phones, both
in hardware and software.</text><text start="764.73" dur="3.09">So you&amp;#39;re looking at a new
bigger 48 megapixel main camera.</text><text start="767.82" dur="1.59">There&amp;#39;s also an improved ultra wide</text><text start="769.41" dur="2.22">with a closer up macro capability</text><text start="771.63" dur="2.474">and a whole telephoto situation</text><text start="774.104" dur="1.426">that we&amp;#39;ll get to in a minute.</text><text start="775.53" dur="3.03">But then with software,
there is this whole new</text><text start="778.56" dur="4.11">intricate image processing
pipeline happening.</text><text start="782.67" dur="1.77">So you know how most smartphones,</text><text start="784.44" dur="2.88">a lot of &amp;#39;em today have
like 48 megapixel cameras</text><text start="787.32" dur="2.52">and they all bin down to 12 megapixels.</text><text start="789.84" dur="1.35">They give you 12 megapixel shots.</text><text start="791.19" dur="2.07">You know, previous iPhones did this,</text><text start="793.26" dur="2.52">this new one, for those
who might&amp;#39;ve missed it,</text><text start="795.78" dur="1.35">is actually by default</text><text start="797.13" dur="4.845">spitting out 24 megapixel
images instead of 12,</text><text start="801.975" dur="2.085">and it&amp;#39;s only about one and
a half times of file size.</text><text start="804.06" dur="1.11">So this new process,</text><text start="805.17" dur="1.47">which is the same
actually across the board</text><text start="806.64" dur="2.79">for iPhone 15s and 15 Pros,</text><text start="809.43" dur="3.66">is it&amp;#39;s taking a 48
megapixel full sensor shot</text><text start="813.09" dur="2.52">for detail information</text><text start="815.61" dur="3.81">and also taking a full
sensor 12 megapixel shot,</text><text start="819.42" dur="4.05">which is the quad binning for
light information and noise.</text><text start="823.47" dur="3.75">And then, it&amp;#39;s using the
neural net to combine them</text><text start="827.22" dur="2.1">and do a sort of a detailed transfer</text><text start="829.32" dur="3.69">to get you this hybrid 24 megapixel image.</text><text start="833.01" dur="3.197">It&amp;#39;s very complicated, very clever,</text><text start="836.207" dur="5">and the end result is slightly better.</text><text start="841.68" dur="2.07">It&amp;#39;s really right in line
with what I&amp;#39;ve been saying.</text><text start="843.75" dur="4.121">So if you just generally look
at photos shot on this camera,</text><text start="847.871" dur="3.199">it&amp;#39;s an iPhone photo, like,
they look pretty great,</text><text start="851.07" dur="1.59">they&amp;#39;re awesome with dynamic range</text><text start="852.66" dur="1.5">and sharpness across the board.</text><text start="854.16" dur="1.02">I still prefer</text><text start="855.18" dur="2.496">and shoot in the rich contrast
profile most of the time,</text><text start="857.676" dur="2.784">but, yeah, mostly, the iPhone
is one of the best cameras</text><text start="860.46" dur="1.41">at just pointing and shooting,</text><text start="861.87" dur="2.43">in full auto, just getting
results that look good,</text><text start="864.3" dur="3.9">even if it doesn&amp;#39;t look the
most like real life, you know,</text><text start="868.2" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s doing the classic
relighting and tone mapping</text><text start="871.26" dur="3.42">and everything we&amp;#39;re used
to from all this smart HDR,</text><text start="874.68" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s all here and a lot of
people like it and it looks good.</text><text start="878.37" dur="2.16">The improved Macro Mode
is also really good.</text><text start="880.53" dur="2.73">And with this natural fall
off with the primary camera</text><text start="883.26" dur="1.32">without even needing Portrait Mode,</text><text start="884.58" dur="2.862">you can get some blurred
backgrounds, it&amp;#39;s awesome.</text><text start="887.442" dur="2.268">Autofocus is also really, really fast,</text><text start="889.71" dur="1.71">especially whenever there&amp;#39;s
a face in the scene,</text><text start="891.42" dur="1.442">this thing loves seeing faces.</text><text start="892.862" dur="2.338">And the benefit of the bigger sensor</text><text start="895.2" dur="1.74">shows itself at night too</text><text start="896.94" dur="2.64">with even longer handheld captures.</text><text start="899.58" dur="3">It&amp;#39;s not magic, it&amp;#39;s just
physics, but, you know,</text><text start="902.58" dur="2.91">does the 24 megapixel make a difference</text><text start="905.49" dur="2.1">over the 12 megapixel?</text><text start="907.59" dur="2.28">Well, zoomed out, absolutely not,</text><text start="909.87" dur="1.35">they look basically the same.</text><text start="911.22" dur="0.84">So you gotta zoom in,</text><text start="912.06" dur="3.63">and even at 50% zoom, you
still can&amp;#39;t really tell.</text><text start="915.69" dur="3.3">It&amp;#39;s not until you zoom all
the way in that you can,</text><text start="918.99" dur="1.32">okay, you can see a difference,</text><text start="920.31" dur="1.71">you can start to notice a difference</text><text start="922.02" dur="1.65">in fine detail and contrast.</text><text start="923.67" dur="2.73">The 15 Pro is definitely,
when your pixel peeping,</text><text start="926.4" dur="2.01">more contrasty and sharp</text><text start="928.41" dur="2.82">when you&amp;#39;re all the way
zoomed in versus last year.</text><text start="931.23" dur="2.624">But that&amp;#39;s just when you&amp;#39;ve
zoomed all the way in.</text><text start="933.854" dur="3.226">And by the way, once you get past 2X zoom,</text><text start="937.08" dur="2.4">it&amp;#39;s back to kicking out
regular 12 megapixel images.</text><text start="939.48" dur="1.14">So again, it&amp;#39;s like,</text><text start="940.62" dur="3.03">it&amp;#39;s a small, small
year-over-year improvement</text><text start="943.65" dur="3.63">with that tiny amount of
like pixel peeping detail,</text><text start="947.28" dur="3.87">but over a longer distance,
over a bunch of generations,</text><text start="951.15" dur="1.71">that&amp;#39;s the type of thing that adds up.</text><text start="952.86" dur="1.08">They even, on the Pro phones,</text><text start="953.94" dur="2.82">did a couple of presets from the 1X lens.</text><text start="956.76" dur="2.58">There&amp;#39;s a 24 millimeter
all the way zoomed out,</text><text start="959.34" dur="2.52">then a 28 millimeter,
a little bit tighter,</text><text start="961.86" dur="3.27">and a 35 millimeter
that all have their own</text><text start="965.13" dur="2.88">dedicated image processing
pipeline presets</text><text start="968.01" dur="1.8">to maximize detail into</text><text start="969.81" dur="2.7">these basically super
res, zoom, focal lengths</text><text start="972.51" dur="2.01">that you can digitally zoom between.</text><text start="974.52" dur="3.24">I wouldn&amp;#39;t exactly call it
having extra lenses on the phone,</text><text start="977.76" dur="3.36">but, you know, 1.5X zoom
on last year&amp;#39;s phone</text><text start="981.12" dur="4.23">versus 1.5X zoom on this year&amp;#39;s
phone, slight difference.</text><text start="985.35" dur="1.62">But there is a difference.</text><text start="986.97" dur="2.49">Honestly, the most Pro things
about these new phones though</text><text start="989.46" dur="2.28">is definitely their video cameras,</text><text start="991.74" dur="2.61">so I&amp;#39;m just gonna nerd out
about these for a second.</text><text start="994.35" dur="2.48">Because the iPhone&amp;#39;s video capabilities,</text><text start="996.83" dur="1.33">I&amp;#39;ve talked about this so much,</text><text start="998.16" dur="2.34">but they&amp;#39;re still so clearly far out</text><text start="1000.5" dur="1.5">in front of the rest of
the smartphone world.</text><text start="1002" dur="1.47">It doesn&amp;#39;t even shoot 8K,</text><text start="1003.47" dur="2.67">which it&amp;#39;s totally capable
of with the 48 megapixels.</text><text start="1006.14" dur="1.35">I wish they would let us,</text><text start="1007.49" dur="4.92">but even just at 4K 30
in full auto, the detail,</text><text start="1012.41" dur="3.48">the auto focus, the slight
depth, the dynamic range,</text><text start="1015.89" dur="2.79">the stabilization,
they&amp;#39;re all world class.</text><text start="1018.68" dur="2.01">I mean, if you wanna just
look at test footage,</text><text start="1020.69" dur="2.64">the entire electric Rivian
delivery van review I did</text><text start="1023.33" dur="2.97">on the Auto Focus channel
was shot on iPhone 15 Pro,</text><text start="1026.3" dur="2.16">audio included, I&amp;#39;ll drop the link below</text><text start="1028.46" dur="1.47">if you wanna watch that whole thing.</text><text start="1029.93" dur="2.88">Also, shout out to the new
AV1 Codec support on the chip,</text><text start="1032.81" dur="1.98">that&amp;#39;s gonna play nice with YouTube.</text><text start="1034.79" dur="3.15">But this year, you can also shoot Log,</text><text start="1037.94" dur="2.88">literally a Pro camera feature.</text><text start="1040.82" dur="2.43">Now it is annoyingly buried</text><text start="1043.25" dur="3.27">several layers deep in
the separate Settings app,</text><text start="1046.52" dur="2.28">which is really not very Pro.</text><text start="1048.8" dur="2.07">But if you find the time
to go switch over there</text><text start="1050.87" dur="1.32">and get into Log,</text><text start="1052.19" dur="2.88">the iPhone will shoot
with way more information,</text><text start="1055.07" dur="3.57">that classic flat Log look,
dynamic range, everything.</text><text start="1058.64" dur="2.34">And you don&amp;#39;t have to deal with
whatever Apple was gonna do</text><text start="1060.98" dur="2.55">with over sharpening and
saturation and processing.</text><text start="1063.53" dur="1.68">Apple has its own transformation LUT</text><text start="1065.21" dur="2.16">to turn it into SDR or HDR</text><text start="1067.37" dur="2.07">or you can go in and
fully grade it yourself</text><text start="1069.44" dur="2.22">to really get the most
out of the iPhone&amp;#39;s video</text><text start="1071.66" dur="3.9">and it looks really,
like, really, really good.</text><text start="1075.56" dur="2.46">So the one thing that I&amp;#39;m
gonna say to, you know,</text><text start="1078.02" dur="2.19">because I&amp;#39;m pixel peeping at this point,</text><text start="1080.21" dur="3.27">is the haloing from point light sources.</text><text start="1083.48" dur="1.41">You know, it&amp;#39;s one of
the hardest challenges</text><text start="1084.89" dur="0.99">with these tiny optics</text><text start="1085.88" dur="1.71">so I get why they haven&amp;#39;t
just fixed it yet,</text><text start="1087.59" dur="1.47">but like it&amp;#39;s pretty bad.</text><text start="1089.06" dur="2.46">Anytime there&amp;#39;s any sort of point lights,</text><text start="1091.52" dur="1.44">especially with video,</text><text start="1092.96" dur="1.98">despite whatever new lens
coding they&amp;#39;re doing,</text><text start="1094.94" dur="1.92">it&amp;#39;s pretty dramatic and it
seems like it&amp;#39;s the worst</text><text start="1096.86" dur="1.38">on the iPhone of any other phone.</text><text start="1098.24" dur="2.01">So it&amp;#39;s there, gonna point it out again,</text><text start="1100.25" dur="3.108">but, hey, if that&amp;#39;s the biggest
downside of iPhone video,</text><text start="1103.358" dur="1.152">I&amp;#39;ll definitely take it.</text><text start="1104.51" dur="1.95">And then, iPhone 15 Pro Max,</text><text start="1106.46" dur="1.83">the big one is the only
one that comes with</text><text start="1108.29" dur="3.099">the new 5X larger telephoto lens.</text><text start="1111.389" dur="2.631">I would bet my life that
that&amp;#39;s gonna come down</text><text start="1114.02" dur="2.85">to the smaller 16 Pro next year, whatever,</text><text start="1116.87" dur="1.2">but it&amp;#39;s only in the big one this time.</text><text start="1118.07" dur="1.56">But yeah, it does let
you get a little further</text><text start="1119.63" dur="3.96">with max zoom, from 15X to 25X.</text><text start="1123.59" dur="3.6">It&amp;#39;s nice if you do a lot
of zoomed photos and videos,</text><text start="1127.19" dur="1.35">which is a very specific crowd,</text><text start="1128.54" dur="1.05">there&amp;#39;s some people that do that,</text><text start="1129.59" dur="2.28">you know, concert goers, things like that.</text><text start="1131.87" dur="2.52">But there are just very few
people who should buy one</text><text start="1134.39" dur="1.95">just for this lens because it also means</text><text start="1136.34" dur="1.74">you have to have a bigger phone</text><text start="1138.08" dur="2.82">and it also happens to
mean that your 4X photos</text><text start="1140.9" dur="1.83">just before you get to 5X</text><text start="1142.73" dur="1.44">will actually be worse on this phone.</text><text start="1144.17" dur="1.47">But, yeah, it&amp;#39;s not nearly as capable</text><text start="1145.64" dur="2.1">as some of the longer
telephoto periscope lens.</text><text start="1147.74" dur="2.64">I mean Samsung has a 10X optical lens</text><text start="1150.38" dur="3">that blows this one out the
water in terms of reach,</text><text start="1153.38" dur="3.39">I think Apple&amp;#39;s main advantage
really is just stabilization.</text><text start="1156.77" dur="2.64">Like, they finally do that
zoom in preview window</text><text start="1159.41" dur="1.35">on the corner of the viewfinder</text><text start="1160.76" dur="1.44">and they overstabilize the frame,</text><text start="1162.2" dur="1.56">so you can zoom all the way in</text><text start="1163.76" dur="2.997">and get a shot in super
creeper mode, it&amp;#39;s great.</text><text start="1166.757" dur="1.923">But I&amp;#39;m just gonna
shamelessly borrow a line</text><text start="1168.68" dur="1.95">from Mr. Mobile because he said it</text><text start="1170.63" dur="2.73">as well as anyone possibly
could, and he&amp;#39;s right,</text><text start="1173.36" dur="2.55">which is just that so
much of the differences</text><text start="1175.91" dur="2.55">between these cameras, this one,</text><text start="1178.46" dur="2.61">the last iPhone, the Samsungs,
the Pixels of the world,</text><text start="1181.07" dur="3">so much of the differences
between them is software</text><text start="1184.07" dur="2.34">that it&amp;#39;s hardly even consistent anymore.</text><text start="1186.41" dur="2.76">So if you are looking
for like a hard verdict</text><text start="1189.17" dur="2.79">on like iPhone 15 Pro side by side</text><text start="1191.96" dur="4.549">versus Samsung versus Pixel
or Oppo, whatever else,</text><text start="1196.509" dur="2.381">you kind of just have to
make it up after a while,</text><text start="1198.89" dur="1.71">like, yeah, there are
gonna be certain instances,</text><text start="1200.6" dur="1.65">like exact zoom focal lengths</text><text start="1202.25" dur="1.59">where one is sharper than the other,</text><text start="1203.84" dur="1.29">but honestly, at at the end of the day,</text><text start="1205.13" dur="1.77">a lot of it is gonna be taste.</text><text start="1206.9" dur="1.95">And so, yeah, you just
kind of have to figure out</text><text start="1208.85" dur="2.212">which one you like as far as image quality</text><text start="1211.062" dur="1.508">and especially UI,</text><text start="1212.57" dur="2.4">just the actual way you
shoot photos and videos.</text><text start="1214.97" dur="1.47">Which reminds me, I do wanna mention,</text><text start="1216.44" dur="3.542">this RAW Max button is hilarious.</text><text start="1219.982" dur="2.128">This is a button to take</text><text start="1222.11" dur="3.09">your full res 48 megapixel Pro RAW photos,</text><text start="1225.2" dur="2.82">but it just says RAW Max, okay.</text><text start="1228.02" dur="2.25">And if you want a 48 megapixel JPEG,</text><text start="1230.27" dur="2.94">you have to jump back into the
Settings app, switch it over,</text><text start="1233.21" dur="4.29">then bounce back, and now
the button says JPEG Max,</text><text start="1237.5" dur="1.614">which is also hilarious.</text><text start="1239.114" dur="1.626">Last thing I gotta say though,</text><text start="1240.74" dur="3.3">this new Pro phone has an Action Button</text><text start="1244.04" dur="1.47">on this new Pro iPhone only</text><text start="1245.51" dur="2.52">because only pros need customization.</text><text start="1248.03" dur="4.11">Look, I kind of love the Action Button,</text><text start="1252.14" dur="1.02">but I also need to realize</text><text start="1253.16" dur="2.85">that it&amp;#39;s kind of either
overrated or underrated,</text><text start="1256.01" dur="1.2">depending on who you are.</text><text start="1257.21" dur="3.15">Like, on one hand, it&amp;#39;s
literally a customizable button,</text><text start="1260.36" dur="1.92">like, who even saw this coming?</text><text start="1262.28" dur="2.37">It replaces the least used button</text><text start="1264.65" dur="1.5">that was on previous iPhones</text><text start="1266.15" dur="2.64">because your phone should
always be on mute anyway.</text><text start="1268.79" dur="2.85">And so, then, you can
map this Action Button</text><text start="1271.64" dur="2.34">to basically anything you want.</text><text start="1273.98" dur="1.29">You can keep it as a mute switch</text><text start="1275.27" dur="1.83">and it has the same strong haptics</text><text start="1277.1" dur="1.77">so you can tell if it&amp;#39;s muted or unmuted</text><text start="1278.87" dur="1.8">in your pocket without looking.</text><text start="1280.67" dur="1.71">But there&amp;#39;s also a bunch
of other cool functions</text><text start="1282.38" dur="1.02">you can pick from,</text><text start="1283.4" dur="3.87">from launching your
camera to a voice recorder</text><text start="1287.27" dur="2.07">to just literally any app on your phone</text><text start="1289.34" dur="1.74">you want through a Siri Shortcut.</text><text start="1291.08" dur="1.14">Your favorite YouTube channel right now</text><text start="1292.22" dur="1.5">is probably making a tutorial</text><text start="1293.72" dur="2.16">on the best Siri Shortcuts</text><text start="1295.88" dur="3.36">to map to the Action
Button from launching apps,</text><text start="1299.24" dur="3.09">to the specific things inside of apps,</text><text start="1302.33" dur="1.829">from unlocking your car,</text><text start="1304.159" dur="2.821">to not just launching my
favorite task manager app,</text><text start="1306.98" dur="3.87">but launching a new task
inside of my task manager app.</text><text start="1310.85" dur="2.46">It just lets me, it&amp;#39;s great,</text><text start="1313.31" dur="1.8">it&amp;#39;s awesome, honestly,
I hope it gets copied,</text><text start="1315.11" dur="2.19">even though a bunch of phones
were doing this years ago</text><text start="1317.3" dur="0.833">and then they stopped.</text><text start="1318.133" dur="2.317">I hope they bring it
back now in a response</text><text start="1320.45" dur="0.99">to how great this is.</text><text start="1321.44" dur="1.943">But on the other hand,</text><text start="1323.383" dur="2.5">I do kind of feel like,
for a lot of people,</text><text start="1325.883" dur="1.317">this is gonna be one of those things</text><text start="1327.2" dur="2.67">that they play with for
like three or four days</text><text start="1329.87" dur="2.01">and then just kind of forget about it</text><text start="1331.88" dur="0.9">and never use it again.</text><text start="1332.78" dur="2.76">And I mostly think that&amp;#39;s
because it&amp;#39;s not super reachable.</text><text start="1335.54" dur="2.97">Like, it&amp;#39;s not a one handable button</text><text start="1338.51" dur="2.55">where your fingers
usually rest for everyone,</text><text start="1341.06" dur="1.23">especially on the Pro Max,</text><text start="1342.29" dur="2.94">it&amp;#39;s way up there on the corner
above the volume buttons.</text><text start="1345.23" dur="2.1">It could be a cool shutter
button for the camera,</text><text start="1347.33" dur="2.04">but the volume buttons already do that,</text><text start="1349.37" dur="1.14">so yeah, I feel like you might as well</text><text start="1350.51" dur="2.04">just end up setting it
back to a mute switch</text><text start="1352.55" dur="2.31">and forgetting about it after a few weeks.</text><text start="1354.86" dur="1.38">But I guess that&amp;#39;s fine too.</text><text start="1356.24" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s one of those things</text><text start="1357.073" dur="1.807">that you&amp;#39;ll just figure
out which user you are</text><text start="1358.88" dur="1.485">after you use it for a while.</text><text start="1360.365" dur="1.935">Kinda like I&amp;#39;ve been using</text><text start="1362.3" dur="1.98">that Eight Sleep mattress
cover that I was talking about,</text><text start="1364.28" dur="2.64">I&amp;#39;ve been using it for
about three months now,</text><text start="1366.92" dur="2.4">this is the pod cover
that goes on your mattress</text><text start="1369.32" dur="3.3">that either warms you up or
cools you down, helps you sleep.</text><text start="1372.62" dur="1.65">Like, now that I&amp;#39;ve used it for a while,</text><text start="1374.27" dur="2.25">I&amp;#39;ve understood, like I
was a skeptic at first,</text><text start="1376.52" dur="1.8">but honestly, it&amp;#39;s one of those things</text><text start="1378.32" dur="3.42">where I go to a hotel bed and
I have a harder time sleeping,</text><text start="1381.74" dur="1.89">which it used to be the other way around,</text><text start="1383.63" dur="3.96">but I just sleep so much
better in the Eight Sleep bed</text><text start="1387.59" dur="2.34">&amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s cooled down
to let you get sleep early</text><text start="1389.93" dur="2.4">and then warms up in the
morning to help you wake up.</text><text start="1392.33" dur="1.23">And it&amp;#39;s become really clear that</text><text start="1393.56" dur="2.07">temperature is one of the
most important factors</text><text start="1395.63" dur="1.17">when it comes to sleep,</text><text start="1396.8" dur="1.44">and it&amp;#39;s become real obvious to me</text><text start="1398.24" dur="1.59">that falling asleep faster,</text><text start="1399.83" dur="1.32">getting better quality sleep</text><text start="1401.15" dur="1.86">and then being able to depend on it</text><text start="1403.01" dur="1.86">is something I wouldn&amp;#39;t
trade for anything.</text><text start="1404.87" dur="2.43">It&amp;#39;s just, it took me
some time to learn that.</text><text start="1407.3" dur="2.07">Plus there&amp;#39;s an app that shows me</text><text start="1409.37" dur="1.98">all my info about my sleep every night</text><text start="1411.35" dur="2.25">and it lets me adjust
the autopilot if I want.</text><text start="1413.6" dur="2.88">If your partner sleeps at a
different side on the same bed,</text><text start="1416.48" dur="2.94">they can adjust the temperature
in the app too, it&amp;#39;s great.</text><text start="1419.42" dur="1.05">So I&amp;#39;ll leave a link to it below,</text><text start="1420.47" dur="1.53">and since they&amp;#39;re a great sponsor,</text><text start="1422" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re actually giving you
guys $200 off the pod cover</text><text start="1425.27" dur="4.173">if you use code &amp;quot;MKBHD&amp;quot;
at eightsleep.com/mkbhd.</text><text start="1430.34" dur="1.351">But anyway, what&amp;#39;s the verdict?</text><text start="1431.691" dur="4.652">What&amp;#39;s the verdict with
the new Pro iPhone of 2023?</text><text start="1437.36" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s one of those things where like</text><text start="1439.04" dur="1.5">I have conversations with friends</text><text start="1440.54" dur="3.06">and I always end up having
to try to condense it all</text><text start="1443.6" dur="1.86">and summarize it into like one sentence,</text><text start="1445.46" dur="1.11">and the truth is like,</text><text start="1446.57" dur="2.49">it&amp;#39;s the same phone as last year with USB,</text><text start="1449.06" dur="1.38">a little bit of a faster chip,</text><text start="1450.44" dur="1.5">a little bit of a brighter screen,</text><text start="1451.94" dur="1.8">a little bit of thinner bezels,</text><text start="1453.74" dur="3.36">and like, I don&amp;#39;t know, better
cameras, that&amp;#39;s kind of it.</text><text start="1457.1" dur="2.61">So you have to decide how much
of that is important to you.</text><text start="1459.71" dur="2.58">Are any of those things important to you?</text><text start="1462.29" dur="4.17">Honestly, USB might be
the most important thing</text><text start="1466.46" dur="3.213">about the new iPhone, despite
what Apple was hoping.</text><text start="1470.78" dur="2.37">Welcome to the club, my friends.</text><text start="1473.15" dur="1.47">Thanks for watching,</text><text start="1474.62" dur="2.604">catch you guys in the next one, peace.</text><text start="1477.224" dur="2.667">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
