<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.113" dur="3.187">(upbeat music)</text><text start="3.3" dur="3.69">- I think Google might have done it.</text><text start="6.99" dur="0.96">The only reason I hesitate</text><text start="7.95" dur="2.34">is because I&amp;#39;ve had
this exact same feeling</text><text start="10.29" dur="4.32">and said this same line before
about, like, the Pixel 6.</text><text start="14.61" dur="2.1">But Google&amp;#39;s phones have
always been all about software</text><text start="16.71" dur="2.88">and we just want them to get
their hardware over the hump</text><text start="19.59" dur="2.373">to have a complete competitive phone,</text><text start="22.89" dur="2.43">but I think they did it.</text><text start="25.32" dur="2.52">So Google had their Pixel 9 event today</text><text start="27.84" dur="1.29">and there&amp;#39;s actually a bit more</text><text start="29.13" dur="1.14">than just the Pixel shown off.</text><text start="30.27" dur="1.38">There&amp;#39;s also a new watch</text><text start="31.65" dur="1.83">and new Pixel Buds, and I&amp;#39;ll get to those,</text><text start="33.48" dur="2.73">but I just wanna focus this
video on the new phones</text><text start="36.21" dur="1.5">because I&amp;#39;ve been waiting
for these for a while.</text><text start="37.71" dur="1.08">So there&amp;#39;s several phones.</text><text start="38.79" dur="2.61">There&amp;#39;s the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro,</text><text start="41.4" dur="5">then the Pixel 9 Pro XL,
and then a Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</text><text start="46.53" dur="2.28">Now, some people are saying
the names are a bit confusing.</text><text start="48.81" dur="1.89">Honestly, it&amp;#39;s not really that bad,</text><text start="50.7" dur="0.96">except maybe the Fold.</text><text start="51.66" dur="3.72">But the base phone, the Pixel 9 is 799.</text><text start="55.38" dur="2.07">And with that you get
the 6.3-inch screen size</text><text start="57.45" dur="3.06">and it has this new design
with the flat matte metal sides</text><text start="60.51" dur="2.76">and a polished glass back in four colors,</text><text start="63.27" dur="3.24">Porcelain is white, Obsidian is black,</text><text start="66.51" dur="3.39">and then Wintergreen and Peony,</text><text start="69.9" dur="1.68">kind of Cosmo and Wanda vibes.</text><text start="71.58" dur="1.71">And then there&amp;#39;s the two Pro phones,</text><text start="73.29" dur="2.82">so the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL.</text><text start="76.11" dur="1.47">So what&amp;#39;s sick is the 9 Pro,</text><text start="77.58" dur="2.31">it&amp;#39;s the exact same size as the Pixel 9,</text><text start="79.89" dur="1.62">just like what the iPhone&amp;#39;s been doing.</text><text start="81.51" dur="1.98">And the only thing that&amp;#39;s
different about the XL</text><text start="83.49" dur="1.2">is it&amp;#39;s just bigger.</text><text start="84.69" dur="2.79">Just a bigger 6.8-inch
screen and a bigger battery.</text><text start="87.48" dur="3.96">But yeah, the Pro phones
start at 999 and 1,099,</text><text start="91.44" dur="0.99">and with that you&amp;#39;ll get</text><text start="92.43" dur="2.76">an extra third camera, telephoto camera,</text><text start="95.19" dur="1.41">they have more RAM,</text><text start="96.6" dur="1.74">and they switch to glossy rails</text><text start="98.34" dur="1.62">with a soft-touch glass back.</text><text start="99.96" dur="1.47">Again in four colors,</text><text start="101.43" dur="3.51">Obsidian, Porcelain,
Hazel, which looks nice,</text><text start="104.94" dur="2.85">and Rose Quartz, kind
of a more faded pink.</text><text start="107.79" dur="2.07">So I got to handle these
phones for like two hours,</text><text start="109.86" dur="2.16">and the entire time
right from the beginning</text><text start="112.02" dur="1.71">I was like, &amp;quot;Oh, wow, yes.</text><text start="113.73" dur="1.14">Okay, Google&amp;#39;s done it.</text><text start="114.87" dur="4.17">These phones really feel and
look like actual flagships.&amp;quot;</text><text start="119.04" dur="1.35">And it&amp;#39;s not just because
the trend these days</text><text start="120.39" dur="1.05">is to do flat sides,</text><text start="121.44" dur="1.68">like obviously I&amp;#39;ve talked
about how I like that,</text><text start="123.12" dur="1.23">but that&amp;#39;s not the only thing.</text><text start="124.35" dur="1.86">They feel a little bit
heavier in the hand now,</text><text start="126.21" dur="1.8">which gives them a more solid feel.</text><text start="128.01" dur="1.95">This screens are all much brighter.</text><text start="129.96" dur="2.46">So the Pixel 9&amp;#39;s Actua display</text><text start="132.42" dur="2.1">is 35% brighter than the Pixel 8</text><text start="134.52" dur="2.28">and there&amp;#39;s thinner
bezels all the way around.</text><text start="136.8" dur="3.27">And yes, finally it&amp;#39;s an
ultrasonic fingerprint reader</text><text start="140.07" dur="1.71">under the display, not optical.</text><text start="141.78" dur="2.58">And the camera visor around the back,</text><text start="144.36" dur="2.85">this is polarizing, but
the huge lens opening,</text><text start="147.21" dur="1.8">I think it just looks promising.</text><text start="149.01" dur="1.92">Now, of course, I&amp;#39;m gonna have to test</text><text start="150.93" dur="1.44">all these things for the full review</text><text start="152.37" dur="1.38">and really see what they&amp;#39;re made of,</text><text start="153.75" dur="1.8">so get subscribed to see that.</text><text start="155.55" dur="2.73">But my first impression at
least is that, you know,</text><text start="158.28" dur="2.28">these photos are gonna
end up very Pixel-like,</text><text start="160.56" dur="1.59">very punchy and contrasty,</text><text start="162.15" dur="1.59">and they&amp;#39;re just bigger
sensors than before,</text><text start="163.74" dur="1.68">so potentially more
shallow depth of field.</text><text start="165.42" dur="2.1">But I guess aesthetically,
the camera bump,</text><text start="167.52" dur="1.59">even though I like the older ones better,</text><text start="169.11" dur="2.37">I still kind of don&amp;#39;t mind these new ones.</text><text start="171.48" dur="1.35">I know it&amp;#39;s not the full visor</text><text start="172.83" dur="3.3">all the way around like
before and I miss that,</text><text start="176.13" dur="2.43">but it&amp;#39;s now this, like,
perfectly flat island</text><text start="178.56" dur="1.23">and that is still distinctive.</text><text start="179.79" dur="2.43">It&amp;#39;s pretty unique as
like a Pixel thing, so.</text><text start="182.22" dur="1.53">Now specs.</text><text start="183.75" dur="1.38">Let&amp;#39;s just get them all in one place.</text><text start="185.13" dur="3.45">There, that&amp;#39;s all the specs
that I&amp;#39;ve been able to confirm.</text><text start="188.58" dur="2.16">You&amp;#39;ll notice all these
phones, across the board,</text><text start="190.74" dur="3.6">all the new Pixels have
the same Tensor G4 chip.</text><text start="194.34" dur="1.74">The new chip is more
powerful, they&amp;#39;re saying,</text><text start="196.08" dur="1.29">and more efficient</text><text start="197.37" dur="3.63">and should have dramatically
better AI capabilities.</text><text start="201" dur="2.4">Obviously, it&amp;#39;s a Pixel,
but we&amp;#39;ll get there.</text><text start="203.4" dur="2.55">But also notice it&amp;#39;s the
exact same primary camera</text><text start="205.95" dur="1.26">and ultrawide camera</text><text start="207.21" dur="3.09">between the base phone and the Pro phone.</text><text start="210.3" dur="2.61">So, again, I&amp;#39;ve talked
about this with Pixel before</text><text start="212.91" dur="2.19">and it makes the lowest priced one</text><text start="215.1" dur="0.833">look like a great deal,</text><text start="215.933" dur="2.557">but there&amp;#39;s not a lot
of hardware difference</text><text start="218.49" dur="2.61">between the base phone and the Pro phone,</text><text start="221.1" dur="2.43">and it&amp;#39;s a $200 difference this year.</text><text start="223.53" dur="2.01">But for that in the Pro
phone, what do you get?</text><text start="225.54" dur="3.09">Maybe a slightly better
screen, a telephoto camera,</text><text start="228.63" dur="4.14">more RAM, and a better selfie camera.</text><text start="232.77" dur="0.833">That&amp;#39;s kind of it.</text><text start="233.603" dur="1.327">Now, again, I don&amp;#39;t wanna make the mistake</text><text start="234.93" dur="2.61">of judging it too soon because
I haven&amp;#39;t benchmarked it</text><text start="237.54" dur="2.16">and I don&amp;#39;t know what
long-term performance is like,</text><text start="239.7" dur="4.35">but when Google says Tensor is
20% faster with web browsing</text><text start="244.05" dur="2.97">and 17% faster with app
launching, I believe them.</text><text start="247.02" dur="2.31">I mean, these phones are
really quick and snappy,</text><text start="249.33" dur="0.99">at least from my impression.</text><text start="250.32" dur="1.14">And I just wanna say again</text><text start="251.46" dur="2.7">that I&amp;#39;m really glad they
made the smaller phone</text><text start="254.16" dur="2.13">with all of the benefits of the Pro,</text><text start="256.29" dur="1.29">because there are a lot of people</text><text start="257.58" dur="2.46">who want a better phone
but not a gigantic phone.</text><text start="260.04" dur="4.44">So having a Pro that&amp;#39;s
not a Pro Max is sick.</text><text start="264.48" dur="2.37">But of course, these
would not be Pixel phones</text><text start="266.85" dur="1.53">without a boatload of AI,</text><text start="268.38" dur="1.98">and so there are definitely
some new AI features</text><text start="270.36" dur="1.47">coming along with these Pixel 9s.</text><text start="271.83" dur="2.52">The big ones are the new Weather app,</text><text start="274.35" dur="3.15">the new Screenshots app, and Pixel Studio.</text><text start="277.5" dur="1.11">So the Google Weather app</text><text start="278.61" dur="2.67">has been redesigned for the
Pixel 9s, as you can see,</text><text start="281.28" dur="1.86">which is a bunch of tiles now,</text><text start="283.14" dur="1.2">and this very, you know,</text><text start="284.34" dur="2.13">modern-looking version of the weather.</text><text start="286.47" dur="2.7">And right at the top is
an AI-generated comment</text><text start="289.17" dur="0.84">about the weather,</text><text start="290.01" dur="2.1">maybe sometimes telling you
what to wear or something.</text><text start="292.11" dur="1.08">Cool, I guess.</text><text start="293.19" dur="2.34">I almost never use the stock
weather app on any phone</text><text start="295.53" dur="1.47">and that probably won&amp;#39;t change here,</text><text start="297" dur="1.74">but for those who do, all right, fine,</text><text start="298.74" dur="0.833">that&amp;#39;s a good improvement.</text><text start="299.573" dur="3.007">The new Screenshots app is interesting.</text><text start="302.58" dur="3.39">Again, I don&amp;#39;t think many
people are going to use this,</text><text start="305.97" dur="2.94">but if you do, it&amp;#39;s basically a new app</text><text start="308.91" dur="2.01">that gathers all of your screenshots</text><text start="310.92" dur="2.19">specifically in one place,</text><text start="313.11" dur="2.1">and then it scans each one of them</text><text start="315.21" dur="1.59">for any information in them</text><text start="316.8" dur="1.92">to be able to remind you later</text><text start="318.72" dur="1.71">or help you search through later.</text><text start="320.43" dur="1.92">But then there&amp;#39;s the Pixel Studio app,</text><text start="322.35" dur="3.3">which I guess that&amp;#39;s the hot
new thing in devices with AI,</text><text start="325.65" dur="1.86">is to have an app called Studio</text><text start="327.51" dur="3.54">that just lets you create
AI-generated art on device</text><text start="331.05" dur="1.32">with a simple text prompt.</text><text start="332.37" dur="1.65">Apple has just announced that in iOS 18,</text><text start="334.02" dur="1.41">but they&amp;#39;re not shipping that yet.</text><text start="335.43" dur="1.02">But the one thing I was impressed</text><text start="336.45" dur="2.01">with playing with this
one is it&amp;#39;s really quick,</text><text start="338.46" dur="3.18">like maybe three seconds or
so to generate a new image.</text><text start="341.64" dur="1.59">And it&amp;#39;s completely on device,</text><text start="343.23" dur="1.38">so it&amp;#39;ll still be this fast</text><text start="344.61" dur="1.38">when your internet connection sucks</text><text start="345.99" dur="1.29">or you&amp;#39;re offline or something like that.</text><text start="347.28" dur="1.86">So yeah, I don&amp;#39;t know,</text><text start="349.14" dur="2.85">maybe your generated pictures or memes</text><text start="351.99" dur="2.31">for text conversations or for Twitter</text><text start="354.3" dur="1.05">or something like that,</text><text start="355.35" dur="3.69">but yeah, it&amp;#39;s another
AI app on the phone.</text><text start="359.04" dur="4.38">Also, Magic Editor in photos
has this new Reimagine feature</text><text start="363.42" dur="2.28">where you can not only erase things</text><text start="365.7" dur="1.62">or reframe things in your pictures,</text><text start="367.32" dur="2.73">but you can now highlight a section</text><text start="370.05" dur="3.24">and reimagine it as something,</text><text start="373.29" dur="1.35">and it can be whatever you type,</text><text start="374.64" dur="1.77">just something completely different.</text><text start="376.41" dur="2.25">So I guess you can straight-up</text><text start="378.66" dur="2.04">make up new scenes and pictures now</text><text start="380.7" dur="1.47">that totally didn&amp;#39;t happen,</text><text start="382.17" dur="2.49">kind of like Samsung&amp;#39;s sketch to image.</text><text start="384.66" dur="1.41">What is going on?</text><text start="386.07" dur="0.96">What is a picture?</text><text start="387.03" dur="3.24">But maybe the best what is a photo feature</text><text start="390.27" dur="1.47">is this new one in the camera,</text><text start="391.74" dur="2.403">again, built right in, called Add Me,</text><text start="395.16" dur="3.3">and it&amp;#39;s actually, I
think, pretty impressive.</text><text start="398.46" dur="0.99">I got to use it once,</text><text start="399.45" dur="2.25">and you&amp;#39;re about to see
exactly me using it once.</text><text start="401.7" dur="1.92">But basically if you ever
have a group of people</text><text start="403.62" dur="1.35">and you wanna take a group shot</text><text start="404.97" dur="1.44">but you don&amp;#39;t have anyone else</text><text start="406.41" dur="3.09">who could take the group shot
for you, okay, no problem,</text><text start="409.5" dur="1.74">the Add Me feature walks you through this.</text><text start="411.24" dur="1.65">So okay, first you open the camera mode</text><text start="412.89" dur="2.28">and it tells you to kind
of wiggle the camera</text><text start="415.17" dur="1.8">around a little bit so
it can get a better sense</text><text start="416.97" dur="2.01">of 3D space and the environment.</text><text start="418.98" dur="2.04">Then the photographer, number one,</text><text start="421.02" dur="2.67">takes a picture of
everyone except for them</text><text start="423.69" dur="2.07">and leaves a little room for themselves.</text><text start="425.76" dur="1.2">Then once they take that,</text><text start="426.96" dur="1.59">they can have everybody peace out</text><text start="428.55" dur="1.74">and then one of those other people</text><text start="430.29" dur="1.77">becomes the new photographer</text><text start="432.06" dur="3.15">and tells the first person where to pose</text><text start="435.21" dur="2.43">so that they can sort of
be next to everyone else.</text><text start="437.64" dur="1.44">It overlays where the people were</text><text start="439.08" dur="1.89">and a nice white box over the scene</text><text start="440.97" dur="2.01">to help keep the framing the same.</text><text start="442.98" dur="1.68">Once the second person poses,</text><text start="444.66" dur="1.23">they snap the picture</text><text start="445.89" dur="2.97">and Google straight-up
merges the pictures together</text><text start="448.86" dur="2.61">into a group photo with everyone.</text><text start="451.47" dur="2.79">Another moment that
totally never happened.</text><text start="454.26" dur="2.01">Plus it keeps the originals too.</text><text start="456.27" dur="1.53">Very 2024.</text><text start="457.8" dur="1.35">What is a photo?</text><text start="459.15" dur="0.833">There&amp;#39;s some other things</text><text start="459.983" dur="3.307">like better Clear Calling, Call Notes,</text><text start="463.29" dur="2.43">can summarize phone calls
that you&amp;#39;re on for you,</text><text start="465.72" dur="4.11">Gemini Live, which is like
having literal conversations</text><text start="469.83" dur="2.01">with the assistant called Gemini.</text><text start="471.84" dur="1.05">It&amp;#39;s still confusing.</text><text start="473.91" dur="1.89">But generally I was most excited</text><text start="475.8" dur="2.58">about the hardware of these phones.</text><text start="478.38" dur="2.13">And then there&amp;#39;s the folding phone.</text><text start="480.51" dur="4.26">So this is the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</text><text start="484.77" dur="1.38">I don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s called that,</text><text start="486.15" dur="2.7">I don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s not
just called the Pixel Fold 2.</text><text start="488.85" dur="1.14">Maybe it&amp;#39;s easier to remember</text><text start="489.99" dur="1.71">&amp;#39;cause now they&amp;#39;re all 9s, but whatever.</text><text start="491.7" dur="2.37">They added Pro to the name for
some reason, but it&amp;#39;s a Fold,</text><text start="494.07" dur="2.61">and the point is it&amp;#39;s
dramatically improved</text><text start="496.68" dur="2.28">from the Pixel Fold that came last year.</text><text start="498.96" dur="2.34">And it&amp;#39;s the same price, 1,799.</text><text start="501.3" dur="2.1">So, look, Google cooked with this thing.</text><text start="503.4" dur="1.44">I think the last Fold</text><text start="504.84" dur="4.23">I was constantly calling the
best foldable to use closed,</text><text start="509.07" dur="2.13">which is kind of a half
compliment, but it&amp;#39;s true.</text><text start="511.2" dur="2.34">This new one has an even bigger screen.</text><text start="513.54" dur="1.17">It&amp;#39;s 6.3 inches,</text><text start="514.71" dur="3.54">so right now it&amp;#39;s about the
size of the other base Pixel 9.</text><text start="518.25" dur="0.99">And it&amp;#39;s still reachable</text><text start="519.24" dur="1.86">because the bezels are all pretty thin.</text><text start="521.1" dur="1.59">The whole phone is thin all the way around</text><text start="522.69" dur="1.143">and it&amp;#39;s also much brighter.</text><text start="523.833" dur="2.307">It&amp;#39;s 80% brighter than the last Fold.</text><text start="526.14" dur="1.5">And then on the inside</text><text start="527.64" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s also a larger eight-inch
display that, like I said,</text><text start="531.57" dur="3.06">it mirrors the home screen
layout of the cover display.</text><text start="534.63" dur="2.88">And the phone with the metal rails now</text><text start="537.51" dur="2.16">and a soft-touch matte glass,</text><text start="539.67" dur="2.7">it just all feels even more premium,</text><text start="542.37" dur="1.71">like a flagship than ever before.</text><text start="544.08" dur="1.59">And look at how thin this thing is.</text><text start="545.67" dur="0.833">This has gotta be,</text><text start="546.503" dur="1.117">I mean, it&amp;#39;s definitely
one of the thinnest</text><text start="547.62" dur="1.59">foldables out now.</text><text start="549.21" dur="1.35">Maybe not the thinnest,</text><text start="550.56" dur="3.24">but each side is barely
thicker than a USB-C port,</text><text start="553.8" dur="2.13">and so combined with the flat sides,</text><text start="555.93" dur="1.56">it&amp;#39;s barely thicker than a normal phone.</text><text start="557.49" dur="4.05">Now, of course, it still has
this camera bump on the back,</text><text start="561.54" dur="3.849">which is, okay, this
one&amp;#39;s worse. (chuckles)</text><text start="565.389" dur="2.571">I don&amp;#39;t see a lot of thoughtful design</text><text start="567.96" dur="2.34">in this camera island,</text><text start="570.3" dur="2.22">but I feel like I can accept it</text><text start="572.52" dur="3.36">with the rest of this phone&amp;#39;s
design being so impressive.</text><text start="575.88" dur="0.84">It&amp;#39;s just so good.</text><text start="576.72" dur="2.4">It feels great to use
open, it&amp;#39;s awesome closed.</text><text start="579.12" dur="1.17">I feel like there&amp;#39;s just a better version</text><text start="580.29" dur="2.34">of the previous best
foldable, the OnePlus Open.</text><text start="582.63" dur="3.3">Of course, still TBD on battery life</text><text start="585.93" dur="2.04">and camera quality with these new cameras</text><text start="587.97" dur="2.22">that are different from the main Pixel 9s,</text><text start="590.19" dur="1.92">but, you know, my general first impression</text><text start="592.11" dur="1.17">is clearly pretty positive.</text><text start="593.28" dur="3.99">It also, of course, has the
Tensor G4, 16 gigs of RAM,</text><text start="597.27" dur="2.94">and all the AI benefits that
come from these new Pixels:</text><text start="600.21" dur="2.13">Pixel Studio, Screenshot app, Weather app,</text><text start="602.34" dur="1.11">all that other Pixel stuff.</text><text start="603.45" dur="2.1">It is also IPX8 rated,</text><text start="605.55" dur="3.09">so it can probably take a splash.</text><text start="608.64" dur="1.89">And Google also mentioned
that they&amp;#39;re partnering</text><text start="610.53" dur="1.62">with some number of developers</text><text start="612.15" dur="2.94">to optimize some games
for the interior screen,</text><text start="615.09" dur="2.46">so looking forward to see
what those end up being.</text><text start="617.55" dur="1.71">And it also comes in two colors:</text><text start="619.26" dur="3.09">Porcelain, white; and Obsidian, black.</text><text start="622.35" dur="2.07">So I think consider me highly interested.</text><text start="624.42" dur="2.67">You know, I&amp;#39;ve kind of been
off the foldables train</text><text start="627.09" dur="1.92">for my own daily driver for a while,</text><text start="629.01" dur="2.07">I&amp;#39;ve gone back to dailying slab phones,</text><text start="631.08" dur="4.71">but I think this Pixel
9 Pro Fold has a chance</text><text start="635.79" dur="1.89">to get me back to being a foldable user</text><text start="637.68" dur="2.22">if that outer screen
remains just as usable</text><text start="639.9" dur="0.87">as any other phone.</text><text start="640.77" dur="3.36">And the bonus is a
gigantic eight-inch screen</text><text start="644.13" dur="1.02">whenever I want it,</text><text start="645.15" dur="2.4">one of the biggest displays
literally ever in a phone.</text><text start="647.55" dur="2.58">So these phones feel, for now,</text><text start="650.13" dur="3.63">like they&amp;#39;ve actually achieved
the modernized glow-up</text><text start="653.76" dur="3">that we&amp;#39;ve been hoping for
from Google&amp;#39;s flagship phone.</text><text start="656.76" dur="1.56">Maybe Qi2 is the only thing missing</text><text start="658.32" dur="1.08">that I&amp;#39;m actually bummed about</text><text start="659.4" dur="1.68">that I can see on the spec sheet.</text><text start="661.08" dur="2.28">But of course, as promised,
it&amp;#39;s not just the phones.</text><text start="663.36" dur="2.52">There&amp;#39;s also a couple other gadgets.</text><text start="665.88" dur="3.96">So the new Pixel Watch 3 has
basically the same design</text><text start="669.84" dur="1.53">but now comes in two sizes.</text><text start="671.37" dur="2.25">There&amp;#39;s a new larger 45-millimeter size</text><text start="673.62" dur="2.61">that gets you, like, 40% more screen.</text><text start="676.23" dur="2.28">And the bezel is also
a little bit smaller.</text><text start="678.51" dur="3.33">So these screens are also
a lot brighter, 2,000 nits.</text><text start="681.84" dur="2.46">And there&amp;#39;s a new body score feature,</text><text start="684.3" dur="1.92">which it seems like
everyone suddenly decided</text><text start="686.22" dur="1.5">to copy from Garmin this year.</text><text start="687.72" dur="1.44">But that will sort of summarize</text><text start="689.16" dur="2.79">all of your metrics into
one score at the top.</text><text start="691.95" dur="2.19">And there&amp;#39;s also some new
running features as well.</text><text start="694.14" dur="1.26">Potentially the biggest change</text><text start="695.4" dur="1.77">is the new dual chip architecture</text><text start="697.17" dur="1.98">to give you even longer battery life,</text><text start="699.15" dur="2.58">they&amp;#39;re saying up to 36
hours in Battery Saver,</text><text start="701.73" dur="2.43">which isn&amp;#39;t exactly
pushing the industry limit,</text><text start="704.16" dur="1.89">but it should be better than last year.</text><text start="706.05" dur="2.76">And same price, 349 for the small one,</text><text start="708.81" dur="1.56">399 for the big one.</text><text start="710.37" dur="1.29">And then there&amp;#39;s the new Pixel Buds.</text><text start="711.66" dur="1.56">So the Pixel Buds Pro 2,</text><text start="713.22" dur="2.91">which at this point are
kind of like Gemini buds.</text><text start="716.13" dur="2.43">So they updated the design
to be a bit smaller,</text><text start="718.56" dur="0.833">as you can see,</text><text start="719.393" dur="2.137">just these little bud
things with no stalks.</text><text start="721.53" dur="1.8">There&amp;#39;s a little tiny stabilizer fin</text><text start="723.33" dur="1.59">to keep it in your ear, hopefully.</text><text start="724.92" dur="1.98">Sometimes it doesn&amp;#39;t work
with my ears, but I&amp;#39;ll try.</text><text start="726.9" dur="2.46">And then there&amp;#39;s a new
custom-designed A1 chip</text><text start="729.36" dur="1.14">based on Tensor</text><text start="730.5" dur="1.77">that improves active noise cancellation,</text><text start="732.27" dur="2.01">improves overall sound quality,</text><text start="734.28" dur="3">and also lets you have a
back-and-forth conversation</text><text start="737.28" dur="1.02">with Gemini Live.</text><text start="738.3" dur="1.74">Just a straight-up, out-loud,</text><text start="740.04" dur="1.77">back-and-forth convo with an assistant.</text><text start="741.81" dur="2.52">I will definitely be getting
my hands on these to test,</text><text start="744.33" dur="1.83">but definitely let me know
what you&amp;#39;re most interested in</text><text start="746.16" dur="1.8">for the full reviews of these things.</text><text start="747.96" dur="2.25">I&amp;#39;m planning on getting my
hands on as many as possible,</text><text start="750.21" dur="1.26">get subscribed to see this stuff.</text><text start="751.47" dur="3.6">But is it the AI features or
is it the new camera stuff?</text><text start="755.07" dur="3.18">Is it the new hardware, which
I think looks pretty sick?</text><text start="758.25" dur="1.68">Let me know in the comment section below.</text><text start="759.93" dur="2.61">Now, a few years back I
put up a poll on Twitter</text><text start="762.54" dur="3.9">asking how many of you
use a case on your phone,</text><text start="766.44" dur="4.203">and, like, three quarters
of you guys said you do.</text><text start="771.63" dur="2.58">And I guess that actually
makes a lot of sense</text><text start="774.21" dur="1.71">and phones have gotten
more expensive since then,</text><text start="775.92" dur="0.833">so I can&amp;#39;t blame you.</text><text start="776.753" dur="1.267">So if you&amp;#39;re thinking of picking one up,</text><text start="778.02" dur="1.41">I definitely recommend checking out</text><text start="779.43" dur="2.4">the Grip Case from channel sponsor dbrand.</text><text start="781.83" dur="1.47">It&amp;#39;s kind of the whole package.</text><text start="783.3" dur="2.67">It comes in matte black,
it&amp;#39;s super grippy,</text><text start="785.97" dur="1.38">it has clicky buttons,</text><text start="787.35" dur="2.1">and it adds those nice strong magnets.</text><text start="789.45" dur="2.64">And yes, obviously also super protective,</text><text start="792.09" dur="2.49">so I&amp;#39;ll leave a link down below
if you wanna check it out.</text><text start="794.58" dur="1.41">Either way, that&amp;#39;s been it.</text><text start="795.99" dur="1.23">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="797.22" dur="1.545">Catch you guys on the next one.</text><text start="798.765" dur="0.937">Peace.</text><text start="799.702" dur="2.583">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
