<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="2.95">(bright music)</text><text start="2.95" dur="2.12">- [Marques] Okay, I got
to see something really,</text><text start="5.07" dur="0.833">really cool.</text><text start="5.903" dur="1.507">I got to visit some of the secret labs</text><text start="7.41" dur="2.49">inside of the Walt Disney Company</text><text start="9.9" dur="2.85">called the Disney Imagineering Labs.</text><text start="12.75" dur="1.02">So, you know, I&amp;#39;ve seen some people talk</text><text start="13.77" dur="1.11">about them a little bit before,</text><text start="14.88" dur="2.82">but obviously Disney has
all these attractions,</text><text start="17.7" dur="2.25">and theme parks, and rides,</text><text start="19.95" dur="4.92">and somebody has to design
and engineer all that stuff.</text><text start="24.87" dur="2.82">And there is a surprising amount
of tech that goes into it.</text><text start="27.69" dur="3.42">And some of it is still
experimental and unreleased,</text><text start="31.11" dur="2.01">where no one outside of Disney,</text><text start="33.12" dur="3.21">well, except for me now,
has got to use them.</text><text start="36.33" dur="1.77">This thing is so cool.</text><text start="38.1" dur="1.89">So Disney Imagineering has
a bunch of these buildings</text><text start="39.99" dur="1.65">scattered around this
California neighborhood</text><text start="41.64" dur="0.84">that I got to visit,</text><text start="42.48" dur="2.43">where they make realistic
animatronic robots</text><text start="44.91" dur="1.68">as part of their attractions.</text><text start="46.59" dur="1.59">They literally greeted me at the door</text><text start="48.18" dur="1.65">with these little droids,</text><text start="49.83" dur="2.43">the same ones that are roaming
around the theme parks.</text><text start="52.26" dur="3.15">And these things have a
striking amount of similarities</text><text start="55.41" dur="2.76">to the Boston Dynamics Spot robot</text><text start="58.17" dur="1.65">that I got to play with a few years ago.</text><text start="59.82" dur="3.3">You know, that Spot robot was
able to navigate any terrain</text><text start="63.12" dur="1.47">with an adaptive gait,</text><text start="64.59" dur="2.1">and it followed
instructions from a custom,</text><text start="66.69" dur="2.46">but surprisingly easy to learn controller</text><text start="69.15" dur="1.35">so that it could navigate around</text><text start="70.5" dur="1.56">and do jobs that humans won&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="72.06" dur="1.77">And it&amp;#39;s also super fun to play with.</text><text start="73.83" dur="2.31">These little droids for the theme parks</text><text start="76.14" dur="1.14">are a lot of the same stuff.</text><text start="77.28" dur="2.1">They are able to adapt to any terrain,</text><text start="79.38" dur="1.8">they walk around, they follow instructions</text><text start="81.18" dur="2.49">from a customized steam
deck as a controller,</text><text start="83.67" dur="2.88">which took me like 60 seconds to learn,</text><text start="86.55" dur="2.97">and they can navigate
around relentlessly all day,</text><text start="89.52" dur="2.46">interacting with guests at a theme park</text><text start="91.98" dur="1.5">and being fun to play with.</text><text start="93.48" dur="1.23">It was super fun.</text><text start="94.71" dur="2.069">And it&amp;#39;s also seriously
crazy how much tech</text><text start="96.779" dur="2.551">is even inside one of these things.</text><text start="99.33" dur="3.12">It&amp;#39;s literally, it&amp;#39;s blending
all these animations together</text><text start="102.45" dur="3.318">from the walking, to the
standing and looking around.</text><text start="105.768" dur="0.852">It&amp;#39;s pretty cool.</text><text start="106.62" dur="1.74">But that&amp;#39;s not even
what I was there to try.</text><text start="108.36" dur="2.37">I was there specifically to be</text><text start="110.73" dur="1.95">the first person outside of Disney</text><text start="112.68" dur="2.88">to walk on the HoloTile.</text><text start="115.56" dur="4.02">So you might&amp;#39;ve seen
some videos about this.</text><text start="119.58" dur="0.87">The HoloTile.</text><text start="120.45" dur="4.47">It&amp;#39;s this insane, one of
one, 360 degree treadmill,</text><text start="124.92" dur="2.31">like a moving floor basically.</text><text start="127.23" dur="1.56">It&amp;#39;s still in an experimental phase</text><text start="128.79" dur="1.47">and this is the only one that exists,</text><text start="130.26" dur="2.07">but it&amp;#39;s already got these
gears turning in my head</text><text start="132.33" dur="3.78">about future potential
applications, particularly in VR.</text><text start="136.11" dur="2.07">And actually one specific thing</text><text start="138.18" dur="1.38">that I have reservations about,</text><text start="139.56" dur="1.08">but I&amp;#39;ll get to that in a minute.</text><text start="140.64" dur="2.91">Now, I don&amp;#39;t know that anyone&amp;#39;s
actually fully explained</text><text start="143.55" dur="2.31">exactly how this thing works yet,</text><text start="145.86" dur="3.09">but you can see that they&amp;#39;re
basically walking across</text><text start="148.95" dur="3.45">a huge number of these
tiny, one inch discs</text><text start="152.4" dur="1.95">that are spinning on top of their bases</text><text start="154.35" dur="1.65">like a bunch of tiny treadmills</text><text start="156" dur="4.32">and then turning to match the
direction that you&amp;#39;re walking.</text><text start="160.32" dur="3.12">So obviously a normal treadmill
is one direction, right?</text><text start="163.44" dur="3.39">Just one flat plane moving
forward and spinning around.</text><text start="166.83" dur="1.65">So you always know exactly
where you&amp;#39;re going.</text><text start="168.48" dur="2.07">But let&amp;#39;s say you want
to build a treadmill</text><text start="170.55" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s responsive and
can go in any direction.</text><text start="174.45" dur="1.5">Well a flat treadmill,</text><text start="175.95" dur="1.05">it would be really hard, right?</text><text start="177" dur="1.38">It would have to spin around quickly</text><text start="178.38" dur="2.04">to match direction you&amp;#39;re walking,</text><text start="180.42" dur="1.56">which is just kind of insane.</text><text start="181.98" dur="3.33">So instead built into the floor</text><text start="185.31" dur="2.01">is a bunch of articulating cones</text><text start="187.32" dur="1.74">with discs on top of them,</text><text start="189.06" dur="2.43">with motors inside to spin those discs.</text><text start="191.49" dur="4.11">Okay, and then the key here
is the discs are tilted.</text><text start="195.6" dur="2.97">So only the edge of the disc in the air</text><text start="198.57" dur="2.61">is the part that&amp;#39;s actually
touching what&amp;#39;s on the floor.</text><text start="201.18" dur="1.95">So it&amp;#39;s less of a flat treadmill</text><text start="203.13" dur="2.31">and more of a bunch of small blades</text><text start="205.44" dur="2.61">that are rotating under your feet.</text><text start="208.05" dur="1.83">So when you walk forward,</text><text start="209.88" dur="4.35">they spin clockwise to move
your foot back to the middle</text><text start="214.23" dur="1.41">once it&amp;#39;s landed.</text><text start="215.64" dur="1.2">And actually when you walk backwards,</text><text start="216.84" dur="1.11">they been counterclockwise</text><text start="217.95" dur="1.23">to move your foot back to the middle.</text><text start="219.18" dur="3">So no matter where you go,
whatever direction you walk,</text><text start="222.18" dur="2.97">no matter how long or
how fast your stride is,</text><text start="225.15" dur="2.55">it&amp;#39;ll always pull you
right back to the middle.</text><text start="227.7" dur="1.68">So I&amp;#39;ve seen these videos
that Disney&amp;#39;s put out</text><text start="229.38" dur="2.43">of this guy walking on it,</text><text start="231.81" dur="1.17">but we gotta work our way up to that.</text><text start="232.98" dur="1.53">You know, I&amp;#39;ve never walked on it before</text><text start="234.51" dur="1.32">and it&amp;#39;s capable of some other things.</text><text start="235.83" dur="1.89">So let&amp;#39;s graduate, let&amp;#39;s get there.</text><text start="237.72" dur="1.56">So there are three ways
to control this thing.</text><text start="239.28" dur="1.29">There is walking on it, obviously,</text><text start="240.57" dur="1.92">but there&amp;#39;s also using a controller,</text><text start="242.49" dur="1.92">like a PlayStation 5 controller.</text><text start="244.41" dur="2.774">And there&amp;#39;s also just
straight up using the force</text><text start="247.184" dur="3.169">and just pointing at it with your hands.</text><text start="251.34" dur="0.833">Let&amp;#39;s start there.</text><text start="252.173" dur="4.237">So first we put this
apple box on the HoloTile.</text><text start="256.41" dur="1.29">And there&amp;#39;s a screen up here</text><text start="257.7" dur="2.76">that shows in real time all of the inputs</text><text start="260.46" dur="1.56">and what the sensors are seeing,</text><text start="262.02" dur="2.28">both on the floor and around the floor.</text><text start="264.3" dur="1.44">And they&amp;#39;ve actually mapped anything</text><text start="265.74" dur="1.59">that crosses a certain line in front of me</text><text start="267.33" dur="2.52">to move whatever object is on the floor.</text><text start="269.85" dur="2.97">So when I move my hand
in front of that line,</text><text start="272.82" dur="2.85">the program moves the floor
around to match the movement</text><text start="275.67" dur="2.94">of the object with the
movement of my hand.</text><text start="278.61" dur="1.77">And this is pretty sick.</text><text start="280.38" dur="2.88">I assume everyone watching
this has seen Star Wars</text><text start="283.26" dur="1.41">and realizes how dope it would be</text><text start="284.67" dur="2.34">to have something like this in some sort</text><text start="287.01" dur="2.41">of Star Wars experience in a theme park.</text><text start="289.42" dur="1.55">So this is already super cool,</text><text start="290.97" dur="1.32">but then the first time I actually get</text><text start="292.29" dur="4.14">to get on the HoloTile
myself is in a chair</text><text start="296.43" dur="1.59">and with a PlayStation controller.</text><text start="298.02" dur="2.31">So I&amp;#39;m gonna be in a chair</text><text start="300.33" dur="1.83">where the chair is on a piece of wood</text><text start="302.16" dur="1.8">so it&amp;#39;s just flat bottom,</text><text start="303.96" dur="2.19">and then they just handed me
the PlayStation controller.</text><text start="306.15" dur="2.433">And, well, see for yourself.</text><text start="312.63" dur="1.077">- Yup.</text><text start="313.707" dur="2.333">- [Speaker] 3, 2, 1, enable.</text><text start="318.307" dur="2.75">(tiles rustling)</text><text start="328.572" dur="2.75">(tiles rustling)</text><text start="334.8" dur="1.83">- [Marques] So the left joystick is mapped</text><text start="336.63" dur="1.2">to control position,</text><text start="337.83" dur="2.64">and the right joystick controls rotation.</text><text start="340.47" dur="2.82">So you can spin around,
and move around freely,</text><text start="343.29" dur="2.58">and actually get pretty
quickly used to this thing.</text><text start="345.87" dur="1.29">And if you&amp;#39;re wondering, yes,</text><text start="347.16" dur="2.01">I can steer myself
completely off of the floor,</text><text start="349.17" dur="2.16">it would let me, I was just
kind of trying to be careful</text><text start="351.33" dur="1.92">to not fling myself off the edge.</text><text start="353.25" dur="2.158">But it moves so fast.</text><text start="355.408" dur="2.732">(tiles rustling)</text><text start="358.14" dur="1.02">So now after all that,</text><text start="359.16" dur="2.19">now that I&amp;#39;ve experienced how it moves,</text><text start="361.35" dur="3.21">now they&amp;#39;re gonna let
me walk on the HoloTile.</text><text start="364.56" dur="2.55">- All right, so I&amp;#39;m gonna
start with training mode,</text><text start="367.11" dur="2.76">which is a fraction of the normal speed,</text><text start="369.87" dur="3.9">but will still get me
used to how this works.</text><text start="373.77" dur="1.68">So, I&amp;#39;m ready.</text><text start="375.45" dur="2.133">- [Speaker] 3, 2, 1, enable.</text><text start="378.6" dur="1.95">- [Marques] Training mode is on.</text><text start="380.55" dur="4.92">So now, slowly start to walk.</text><text start="385.47" dur="2.973">I can feel them kind of
wiggling a little bit,</text><text start="389.58" dur="2.97">but not really moving too quickly yet.</text><text start="392.55" dur="0.87">So this is normal.</text><text start="393.42" dur="1.62">Oh, okay, now they&amp;#39;re starting to move</text><text start="395.04" dur="4.02">and my feet are starting
to move with the tiles.</text><text start="399.06" dur="0.833">There we go.</text><text start="401.91" dur="2.52">So as I slowly walk a little bit faster,</text><text start="404.43" dur="3.813">a little bit more quickly,
a little longer strides,</text><text start="410.79" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;m getting more used to
the feeling of the tiles.</text><text start="415.08" dur="3.42">So they designed this to be
about a two minute process</text><text start="418.5" dur="3.06">as these tiny tiles slowly speed up</text><text start="421.56" dur="2.28">their responsiveness to my movements.</text><text start="423.84" dur="1.53">And it was slowly turned up more and more,</text><text start="425.37" dur="3.78">basically until it was at a
hundred percent real time.</text><text start="429.15" dur="3.513">It&amp;#39;s moving pretty close to
full speed now feels like.</text><text start="434.67" dur="1.8">And there&amp;#39;s obviously a learning curve,</text><text start="436.47" dur="4.11">but I feel like I&amp;#39;m good enough at it</text><text start="440.58" dur="3.393">that I can kind of walk
around and not think too hard.</text><text start="445.02" dur="1.14">Feels good.</text><text start="446.16" dur="3.543">And then there&amp;#39;s all the
data behind me in real time.</text><text start="451.59" dur="2.823">Showing my feet, my legs.</text><text start="457.83" dur="2.19">So walking on this, I
noticed a couple things.</text><text start="460.02" dur="2.07">First of all, as you&amp;#39;ve
heard through this video,</text><text start="462.09" dur="1.2">it&amp;#39;s pretty loud.</text><text start="463.29" dur="1.02">Like this is gonna be something</text><text start="464.31" dur="1.44">they definitely are gonna wanna work on,</text><text start="465.75" dur="1.35">especially if it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;ll be</text><text start="467.1" dur="1.86">a part of a theme park someday,</text><text start="468.96" dur="2.49">or maybe even in someone&amp;#39;s home.</text><text start="471.45" dur="2.19">But also, I found it fascinating,</text><text start="473.64" dur="2.46">you&amp;#39;re never actually quite walking</text><text start="476.1" dur="1.89">in a perfectly straight line.</text><text start="477.99" dur="1.56">Like, it can feel pretty close</text><text start="479.55" dur="2.91">if your foot happens to
line up along a row of discs</text><text start="482.46" dur="2.67">that are all aligned in
a way from the center.</text><text start="485.13" dur="1.92">But other times you&amp;#39;re
just kind of gliding</text><text start="487.05" dur="2.13">over the top of a bunch of these ridges</text><text start="489.18" dur="3">and you&amp;#39;re not moving in
a perfectly straight line.</text><text start="492.18" dur="1.89">I imagine a future version of this</text><text start="494.07" dur="2.58">looks like a whole bunch of much smaller</text><text start="496.65" dur="1.95">and more numerous discs</text><text start="498.6" dur="1.74">that are just as powerful as they are,</text><text start="500.34" dur="1.8">which is clearly an engineering challenge,</text><text start="502.14" dur="1.95">or an Imagineering challenge.</text><text start="504.09" dur="2.07">So yeah, this takes some getting used to.</text><text start="506.16" dur="1.77">I know that because I got to hang out</text><text start="507.93" dur="2.85">with the inventor of the
HoloTile, Lanny Smoot.</text><text start="510.78" dur="2.85">He&amp;#39;s been at Disney
for more than 20 years.</text><text start="513.63" dur="2.34">He&amp;#39;s got more than 70 patents,</text><text start="515.97" dur="3.27">including the way the BB8
rolls around the park,</text><text start="519.24" dur="2.76">the real life lightsabers,
just to name a few.</text><text start="522" dur="1.41">He&amp;#39;s kind of a legend.</text><text start="523.41" dur="1.53">And, yeah, this guy&amp;#39;s incredible on it.</text><text start="524.94" dur="1.89">He was showing me that
you can have two people</text><text start="526.83" dur="1.05">on it at once,</text><text start="527.88" dur="1.92">and they were playing a
multiplayer racing game,</text><text start="529.8" dur="2.46">like controlling a BB8
eight around a course</text><text start="532.26" dur="1.35">by jogging around.</text><text start="533.61" dur="1.26">And it seemed to work pretty well,</text><text start="534.87" dur="1.23">aside from being pretty small.</text><text start="536.1" dur="0.96">Obviously this would work better</text><text start="537.06" dur="1.59">if they had more of these floor tiles.</text><text start="538.65" dur="1.47">But then what I found the most crazy</text><text start="540.12" dur="3.54">is using this floor with a VR headset on.</text><text start="543.66" dur="1.53">So this is what you would
expect it to be for,</text><text start="545.19" dur="0.833">for VR, right?</text><text start="546.023" dur="0.833">And there&amp;#39;s been some other</text><text start="546.856" dur="2.924">360-degree treadmill
type of videos I&amp;#39;ve seen,</text><text start="549.78" dur="2.22">other types of inventions used for VR.</text><text start="552" dur="0.833">And they work,</text><text start="552.833" dur="1.897">but the one thing that&amp;#39;s hard about these,</text><text start="554.73" dur="1.23">and it&amp;#39;s hard to explain through video,</text><text start="555.96" dur="3.27">but the difference
between what your eyes see</text><text start="559.23" dur="4.59">and what your body and brain
feel, that disagreement.</text><text start="563.82" dur="1.65">So meaning like, this
has always been true,</text><text start="565.47" dur="3.63">if you look down at your phone
a lot in a moving car, right?</text><text start="569.1" dur="2.19">Your eyes are seeing something still,</text><text start="571.29" dur="1.8">they see your body sitting still,</text><text start="573.09" dur="1.86">but then your brain and your inner ear</text><text start="574.95" dur="2.79">feels you moving around, moving forward.</text><text start="577.74" dur="3.21">And so the disagreement
between what your eyes see</text><text start="580.95" dur="1.68">and what your brain feel,</text><text start="582.63" dur="2.25">that&amp;#39;s what can give you motion sickness.</text><text start="584.88" dur="1.08">That&amp;#39;s what feels bad.</text><text start="585.96" dur="2.19">And so if you think about
it, it&amp;#39;s the same thing</text><text start="588.15" dur="3.15">with this moving treadmill in VR.</text><text start="591.3" dur="2.43">You put the headset on
and you start walking,</text><text start="593.73" dur="1.2">and your eyes see</text><text start="594.93" dur="2.16">that you are walking
down a moving hallway,</text><text start="597.09" dur="1.02">you&amp;#39;re moving forward.</text><text start="598.11" dur="2.85">But your brain, because
you&amp;#39;re walking in place,</text><text start="600.96" dur="2.67">doesn&amp;#39;t feel that it&amp;#39;s
supposed to be moving forward.</text><text start="603.63" dur="2.61">So again, there&amp;#39;s a disagreement there.</text><text start="606.24" dur="1.02">So with the HoloTile,</text><text start="607.26" dur="2.25">I got to try putting
on an Apple Vision Pro</text><text start="609.51" dur="3.45">and actually walking around
a 3D constructed environment.</text><text start="612.96" dur="2.31">You can&amp;#39;t see it, but
I&amp;#39;m in like a holo deck</text><text start="615.27" dur="1.68">in Star Trek or something,</text><text start="616.95" dur="2.34">and I&amp;#39;ve got a harness
on because it turns out</text><text start="619.29" dur="0.96">this is really hard.</text><text start="620.25" dur="1.68">My eyes see the movement,</text><text start="621.93" dur="2.1">and my legs are trying to walk forward,</text><text start="624.03" dur="1.26">and my feet are sliding around,</text><text start="625.29" dur="2.1">but my brain thinks I&amp;#39;m not
supposed to be moving forward.</text><text start="627.39" dur="1.47">So, it&amp;#39;s confusing.</text><text start="628.86" dur="2.37">It&amp;#39;s hard to just trust it and walk.</text><text start="631.23" dur="1.08">Plus there&amp;#39;s the extra layer</text><text start="632.31" dur="1.77">of sometimes it moves you
backwards a little bit</text><text start="634.08" dur="0.833">to the center.</text><text start="634.913" dur="2.197">So I was taking all these baby steps.</text><text start="637.11" dur="2.43">Meanwhile though, watch Lanny do it,</text><text start="639.54" dur="2.07">and he&amp;#39;s just incredible at it.</text><text start="641.61" dur="1.59">Like he had the headset on,</text><text start="643.2" dur="2.67">he was walking around
confidently through space,</text><text start="645.87" dur="1.8">exploring a virtual world.</text><text start="647.67" dur="0.833">Pretty sure it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="648.503" dur="1.837">a virtual Disney theme park type of thing.</text><text start="650.34" dur="2.04">But that&amp;#39;s the type of thing</text><text start="652.38" dur="2.1">that feels the most like the future.</text><text start="654.48" dur="1.44">Just freeform,</text><text start="655.92" dur="2.7">exploring some huge space, walking around,</text><text start="658.62" dur="2.31">in the comfort of your own home maybe.</text><text start="660.93" dur="1.41">And that would be amazing.</text><text start="662.34" dur="2.91">And if this thing can
continue to be developed,</text><text start="665.25" dur="1.77">maybe, just maybe,</text><text start="667.02" dur="2.82">it can get us closer to
that reality someday.</text><text start="669.84" dur="2.13">Either way, that is definitely dope tech.</text><text start="671.97" dur="2.07">I&amp;#39;m glad I got to see the
first version of this,</text><text start="674.04" dur="3.54">and I&amp;#39;m very curious and
excited to see future versions.</text><text start="677.58" dur="1.74">Disney, please invite me back.</text><text start="679.32" dur="3.39">I wanna see what the future
of this actually looks like.</text><text start="682.71" dur="1.77">Okay, that&amp;#39;s it.</text><text start="684.48" dur="1.38">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="685.86" dur="1.38">Catch you in the next one.</text><text start="687.24" dur="1.212">Peace.</text><text start="688.452" dur="2.583">(bright music)</text></transcript>
