<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.237" dur="3.153">- All right, here&amp;#39;s a theory
I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about.</text><text start="3.39" dur="3.36">Someday, maybe not next year
or five or even 10 years,</text><text start="6.75" dur="2.79">but maybe someday we&amp;#39;ll
all live in a world</text><text start="9.54" dur="2.07">where we all have these wearable computers</text><text start="11.61" dur="2.16">on our faces all the time.</text><text start="13.77" dur="1.08">And a lot of these tech companies</text><text start="14.85" dur="1.26">really believe in that future.</text><text start="16.11" dur="1.89">Like I&amp;#39;ve never spoken
to anyone on Planet Earth</text><text start="18" dur="1.89">who believes more than Mark Zuckerberg</text><text start="19.89" dur="2.94">that humans are on their way to spending</text><text start="22.83" dur="2.79">tons of their time in
some sort of metaverse.</text><text start="25.62" dur="2.82">But the tech is clearly
not good enough yet,</text><text start="28.44" dur="2.22">today in 2023 for anyone to wanna do that.</text><text start="30.66" dur="3.03">Like this is what a VR
headset looks like in 2023,</text><text start="33.69" dur="1.41">and this is the best we&amp;#39;ve got.</text><text start="35.1" dur="4.71">And even now, the computers
and pixels and batteries,</text><text start="39.81" dur="2.58">and everything on your face are too much</text><text start="42.39" dur="2.73">for people to wanna spend all
day in something like this.</text><text start="45.12" dur="1.86">But we&amp;#39;re all kind of on board that</text><text start="46.98" dur="3.45">maybe someday the tech will
shrink down more, and more,</text><text start="50.43" dur="2.16">and more and more until eventually,</text><text start="52.59" dur="2.88">it&amp;#39;s no more than just a
normal looking pair of glasses.</text><text start="55.47" dur="1.47">And then maybe at that point,</text><text start="56.94" dur="1.2">we&amp;#39;ll all be cool wearing it every day.</text><text start="58.14" dur="0.833">So this is Quest 3,</text><text start="58.973" dur="2.497">this newest and latest and
greatest headset from Meta.</text><text start="61.47" dur="3.48">My theory is, is on
this side of the scale,</text><text start="64.95" dur="4.26">and on the other side of the
sliding scale is smart glasses.</text><text start="69.21" dur="2.25">And meta literally is also
announcing smart glasses</text><text start="71.46" dur="0.833">at their event.</text><text start="72.293" dur="1.807">So these things are
literally called the RayBan</text><text start="74.1" dur="3.18">Meta Smart Glasses, AKA
the RayBan Stories too.</text><text start="77.28" dur="1.68">Right now, they are super simple,</text><text start="78.96" dur="1.77">they don&amp;#39;t do much
because they can only fit</text><text start="80.73" dur="2.67">a camera and small
speakers, and a battery,</text><text start="83.4" dur="1.68">but there are some clever tricks</text><text start="85.08" dur="2.22">that enable them to do
as much as possible.</text><text start="87.3" dur="3.24">And maybe someday the tech
will get powerful enough</text><text start="90.54" dur="3.54">and useful enough for people
to want to use these every day.</text><text start="94.08" dur="2.76">So VR headsets are racing
to get smaller and smaller,</text><text start="96.84" dur="3">and smart glasses are racing
to get better and better tech,</text><text start="99.84" dur="2.67">and they&amp;#39;re both basically
racing towards each other,</text><text start="102.51" dur="3.24">and companies like Meta are
spending tons and tons of money</text><text start="105.75" dur="2.4">to develop these things to figure out</text><text start="108.15" dur="2.31">which strategy will hit first.</text><text start="110.46" dur="2.4">So let&amp;#39;s see.</text><text start="112.86" dur="1.35">Let&amp;#39;s start with the headset.</text><text start="114.21" dur="3.48">So this is the latest and
greatest from Meta, the Quest 3.</text><text start="117.69" dur="2.64">And this is the year they made
their big pivot to it being</text><text start="120.33" dur="1.62">a mixed reality headset,</text><text start="121.95" dur="2.16">which in hindsight feels
like a natural progression</text><text start="124.11" dur="2.22">for these things if you wanna
get them more comfortable</text><text start="126.33" dur="2.43">for people to wear every day like glasses.</text><text start="128.76" dur="1.8">So in previous VR headsets,</text><text start="130.56" dur="2.16">it really felt like pass
through was an afterthought.</text><text start="132.72" dur="1.41">Like you put the headset on,</text><text start="134.13" dur="2.31">and you&amp;#39;re just immediately
in your own world</text><text start="136.44" dur="1.47">until you take the headset off.</text><text start="137.91" dur="2.37">And this new version is
still built to be immersive,</text><text start="140.28" dur="1.65">it still has all the light blocking</text><text start="141.93" dur="1.77">and fills your field of view with screens</text><text start="143.7" dur="1.56">and makes it as immersive as possible.</text><text start="145.26" dur="2.61">But it now has a bunch more sensors</text><text start="147.87" dur="3.15">arranged around the outside
that make pass through</text><text start="151.02" dur="2.25">dramatically better than before.</text><text start="153.27" dur="3.96">It&amp;#39;s now color, stereo, very low latency,</text><text start="157.23" dur="1.74">and decently high resolution.</text><text start="158.97" dur="1.92">And there&amp;#39;s immediately
a bunch of benefits</text><text start="160.89" dur="2.16">to having pass through being this good.</text><text start="163.05" dur="2.94">First of all, the setup
was way more intuitive.</text><text start="165.99" dur="1.53">Like you can literally
take it to a new spot</text><text start="167.52" dur="2.22">for the first time and
just put it on it boots up,</text><text start="169.74" dur="1.56">and automatically you look down</text><text start="171.3" dur="2.37">and it just maps out the
floor of the room you&amp;#39;re in.</text><text start="173.67" dur="2.4">The available floor space,
the objects in the room,</text><text start="176.07" dur="1.65">the spots where you can stand,</text><text start="177.72" dur="2.04">and to surprisingly great accuracy.</text><text start="179.76" dur="2.34">So it&amp;#39;s using a pair of RGB cameras</text><text start="182.1" dur="2.13">and the Lidar sensor in the middle.</text><text start="184.23" dur="3.39">So you no longer have to
painstakingly draw a play area</text><text start="187.62" dur="1.29">every single time and stick with it.</text><text start="188.91" dur="2.67">It just naturally feels
like it plants the menu</text><text start="191.58" dur="2.19">floating right in the middle
of where you&amp;#39;re standing,</text><text start="193.77" dur="1.83">and you can still see
everything around you.</text><text start="195.6" dur="2.07">Now you may be wondering,
okay, how good though</text><text start="197.67" dur="2.43">like exactly is the Quest 3?</text><text start="200.1" dur="1.26">Is it the best?</text><text start="201.36" dur="2.571">Is it better than the Quest Pro?</text><text start="203.931" dur="2.52">Yes, it&amp;#39;s better than the Quest Pro</text><text start="206.451" dur="3.16">but it is not as good as Apple Vision Pro.</text><text start="209.611" dur="1.949">I would kind of equate it to like,</text><text start="211.56" dur="1.8">if I gave you a clear pair of glasses</text><text start="213.36" dur="3.27">that were not exactly your prescription.</text><text start="216.63" dur="2.85">But basically this one&amp;#39;s good
because it&amp;#39;s stereo and color,</text><text start="219.48" dur="2.79">and nearly real time, so
you see accurate colors,</text><text start="222.27" dur="2.85">you look at your hands and
you can find the controllers</text><text start="225.12" dur="0.93">wherever they are in the room,</text><text start="226.05" dur="1.44">just pick them up and put them down</text><text start="227.49" dur="2.25">without needing someone
to hand them to you.</text><text start="229.74" dur="1.47">Just so many benefits like that.</text><text start="231.21" dur="2.4">There&amp;#39;s also just a small
amount of distortion</text><text start="233.61" dur="1.2">with up close objects</text><text start="234.81" dur="1.77">and things near the edges of your vision.</text><text start="236.58" dur="3.27">But it&amp;#39;s not quite high
enough fidelity to like</text><text start="239.85" dur="2.85">pick up your phone and
start using that screen.</text><text start="242.7" dur="1.23">So like if you get a text,</text><text start="243.93" dur="1.38">you&amp;#39;re still gonna have
to take the headset off</text><text start="245.31" dur="0.87">to be able to read it.</text><text start="246.18" dur="2.97">And I know comparing
it to a $3,500 headset</text><text start="249.15" dur="2.61">feels unnecessary and it kind of is,</text><text start="251.76" dur="1.62">but also a lot of people
are asking me about it,</text><text start="253.38" dur="1.86">and I&amp;#39;m one of the few
people who can actually</text><text start="255.24" dur="1.08">say they&amp;#39;ve tried both.</text><text start="256.32" dur="2.67">So I will say that yes, Apple Vision Pro</text><text start="258.99" dur="2.88">is still the best pass
through I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced.</text><text start="261.87" dur="2.94">I distinctly remember taking
notes about my experience</text><text start="264.81" dur="2.76">on my phone while still
wearing the headset,</text><text start="267.57" dur="0.833">it was kind of insane.</text><text start="268.403" dur="1.867">But for a $500 headset, yeah.</text><text start="270.27" dur="1.86">This is absolutely as
good as you&amp;#39;re gonna see.</text><text start="272.13" dur="3.12">And combined with the high
resolution of the actual menus</text><text start="275.25" dur="1.721">and the accuracy of the controllers,</text><text start="276.971" dur="1.699">I think it&amp;#39;s pretty awesome.</text><text start="278.67" dur="1.65">And then of course, the
other benefit to having</text><text start="280.32" dur="2.82">way higher quality sensors
around the outside of the headset</text><text start="283.14" dur="2.43">is you don&amp;#39;t actually
need the controllers.</text><text start="285.57" dur="1.23">Now you&amp;#39;ve always had the choice</text><text start="286.8" dur="2.97">to either use the controllers
or use your hands.</text><text start="289.77" dur="1.89">And these controllers have
gotten better over the years,</text><text start="291.66" dur="1.77">they&amp;#39;re smaller, they&amp;#39;re pretty sweet,</text><text start="293.43" dur="1.92">they have better haptics than ever before.</text><text start="295.35" dur="2.85">But the hand tracking has
also gotten way better</text><text start="298.2" dur="1.74">and really intuitive and responsive.</text><text start="299.94" dur="2.97">And I think this is key again,
to feeling like the future.</text><text start="302.91" dur="3.63">So you do this pinch gesture
here to pull up the menu</text><text start="306.54" dur="1.83">and move around to select things.</text><text start="308.37" dur="1.8">You can literally scroll around menus</text><text start="310.17" dur="2.22">by touching the digital menu</text><text start="312.39" dur="1.98">and flinging them through
space with your finger.</text><text start="314.37" dur="2.67">Or you can grab a window
and just move it around,</text><text start="317.04" dur="1.95">putting it on a table or
floating it in the air,</text><text start="318.99" dur="2.79">and it just stays locked
there, which is pretty awesome.</text><text start="321.78" dur="3.87">So pretty much everything
except typing is natural.</text><text start="325.65" dur="1.23">It works as you&amp;#39;d expect,</text><text start="326.88" dur="2.37">like you&amp;#39;re typing on a virtual
keyboard floating in space,</text><text start="329.25" dur="1.8">but this will definitely
take more practice,</text><text start="331.05" dur="1.71">because there&amp;#39;s no haptic feedback.</text><text start="332.76" dur="2.01">See the other gestures I was talking about</text><text start="334.77" dur="2.01">almost always have a haptic feedback</text><text start="336.78" dur="1.86">of your own fingers hitting each other,</text><text start="338.64" dur="1.11">which is really interesting.</text><text start="339.75" dur="2.73">This keyboard here,
you&amp;#39;re sort of just poking</text><text start="342.48" dur="2.97">an invisible plane in the air
where the keyboard should be,</text><text start="345.45" dur="1.29">so that that&amp;#39;s a little tougher.</text><text start="346.74" dur="1.8">The main selling point
of this headset though,</text><text start="348.54" dur="2.667">is still playing games, that&amp;#39;s
still what it&amp;#39;s super good at</text><text start="351.207" dur="2.643">and it plays all the same games
that the Quest 2 could play,</text><text start="353.85" dur="1.92">and there are even some
games optimized for Quest 3</text><text start="355.77" dur="0.9">that it&amp;#39;s even better at.</text><text start="356.67" dur="3.18">It has this nextgen Qualcomm
Snapdragon XR2 chip,</text><text start="359.85" dur="2.13">it has higher resolution per eye,</text><text start="361.98" dur="2.31">it has a wider more
immersive field of view,</text><text start="364.29" dur="1.98">and it&amp;#39;s, in my opinion
slightly more comfortable,</text><text start="366.27" dur="2.58">thanks to this new strap that
improves weight distribution.</text><text start="368.85" dur="1.35">So I&amp;#39;ve been playing a bunch,</text><text start="370.2" dur="2.25">I&amp;#39;ve really enjoyed this
golf game that feels</text><text start="372.45" dur="3.63">surprisingly realistic as
someone that was expecting like</text><text start="376.08" dur="2.4">wee golf levels of graphics and control.</text><text start="378.48" dur="1.11">Also pinging pong,</text><text start="379.59" dur="3.66">which this has this eerie
multiplayer mode online,</text><text start="383.25" dur="2.61">where someone else&amp;#39;s avatar
just shows up in your space</text><text start="385.86" dur="2.684">standing 10 feet away from
you, but with no legs.</text><text start="388.544" dur="3.886">But there&amp;#39;s the classics
like Beat Saber, Super Hot,</text><text start="392.43" dur="2.64">and then even some new ones
like The Rotag is Blowing Up.</text><text start="395.07" dur="2.76">All this stuff is the
main reason why today,</text><text start="397.83" dur="1.08">you&amp;#39;d buy something like this,</text><text start="398.91" dur="2.37">to spend like half an hour in the thing.</text><text start="401.28" dur="2.28">But again, the tech is shrinking down</text><text start="403.56" dur="3.12">more and more and more,
and will every single year,</text><text start="406.68" dur="4.17">until it gets close to something
like these, smart glasses.</text><text start="410.85" dur="1.53">So let&amp;#39;s talk about the smart glasses.</text><text start="412.38" dur="1.92">So these are the Meta Smart Glasses,</text><text start="414.3" dur="1.08">and there&amp;#39;s others like it,</text><text start="415.38" dur="1.71">but they&amp;#39;re gonna start at
the other end of the spectrum</text><text start="417.09" dur="1.74">where there&amp;#39;s only so much stuff</text><text start="418.83" dur="2.76">that you can stuff into a
regular looking pair of glasses</text><text start="421.59" dur="2.125">that nobody would even look twice at.</text><text start="423.715" dur="3.395">But over time, as tech gets
better and more powerful,</text><text start="427.11" dur="1.32">and more miniaturized,</text><text start="428.43" dur="2.73">these things will get
more and more powerful</text><text start="431.16" dur="2.52">and more and more able to do more stuff.</text><text start="433.68" dur="2.82">So right now this is a 12 megapixel camera</text><text start="436.5" dur="2.79">with a little LED light ring
to indicate when it&amp;#39;s recording</text><text start="439.29" dur="1.38">or taking a picture.</text><text start="440.67" dur="3.72">A shutter button on top, and
then a literal computer inside</text><text start="444.39" dur="3.21">with some storage, a
touch pad on the side,</text><text start="447.6" dur="1.11">and then some microphones,</text><text start="448.71" dur="1.89">and then these really
tiny pinhole speakers</text><text start="450.6" dur="3">that fire audio downwards
directly into your ears.</text><text start="453.6" dur="1.29">It doesn&amp;#39;t sound like much,</text><text start="454.89" dur="2.04">but when paired directly to your phone,</text><text start="456.93" dur="2.82">and the Meta View app, this
thing is surprisingly capable</text><text start="459.75" dur="1.95">as a little computer on your face.</text><text start="461.7" dur="1.8">So you can use the camera of course</text><text start="463.5" dur="2.31">to just take first person
pictures and videos</text><text start="465.81" dur="1.56">just by hitting the shutter button.</text><text start="467.37" dur="2.88">Videos are limited to 60 seconds or less,</text><text start="470.25" dur="1.77">and portrait orientation.</text><text start="472.02" dur="1.02">But honestly, despite all that,</text><text start="473.04" dur="2.25">they&amp;#39;re actually pretty
solid looking videos</text><text start="475.29" dur="1.2">and there&amp;#39;s some promise here,</text><text start="476.49" dur="2.85">I kind of feel like I might
want to use these for auto focus</text><text start="479.34" dur="1.47">for like car driving footage,</text><text start="480.81" dur="1.14">if I could get wide screen out of them,</text><text start="481.95" dur="0.833">that would be awesome.</text><text start="482.783" dur="1.087">And then you can also start a recording</text><text start="483.87" dur="1.567">or take a picture just by saying,</text><text start="485.437" dur="2.12">&amp;quot;Hey, Meta take a picture.&amp;quot;</text><text start="488.67" dur="2.1">And so you could see
that it was pretty fast,</text><text start="490.77" dur="1.38">the little light there.</text><text start="492.15" dur="1.56">I don&amp;#39;t know if you wanna</text><text start="493.71" dur="1.65">say that phrase out loud very often,</text><text start="495.36" dur="1.5">so you might just stick to one of these,</text><text start="496.86" dur="3.27">but yeah, it has a voice
assistant built in.</text><text start="500.13" dur="1.41">So you can send and receive messages</text><text start="501.54" dur="3">through WhatsApp Messenger,
you know, Meta stuff.</text><text start="504.54" dur="2.22">But it&amp;#39;s just audio,</text><text start="506.76" dur="2.67">like there&amp;#39;s no screen
anywhere in here built in.</text><text start="509.43" dur="3.15">So this really works best with experiences</text><text start="512.58" dur="3">that can be entirely
handled with just audio.</text><text start="515.58" dur="2.01">So they&amp;#39;re connected all
the time to your phone</text><text start="517.59" dur="2.61">via Bluetooth, so you can listen to music.</text><text start="520.2" dur="2.7">And these little speakers
are directional enough that</text><text start="522.9" dur="2.91">at half volume, there&amp;#39;s
really not that much bleed.</text><text start="525.81" dur="2.31">And that high volume, it
kind of just sounds the same</text><text start="528.12" dur="1.44">as someone like maybe
listening next to you</text><text start="529.56" dur="2.057">with open back headphones.</text><text start="531.617" dur="2.417">(rap music)</text><text start="536.848" dur="1.562">That&amp;#39;s as loud as it gets.</text><text start="538.41" dur="4.47">But you can also ask questions of the Meta</text><text start="542.88" dur="2.28">virtual assistant, little
AI virtual assistant</text><text start="545.16" dur="3.21">built into the computers in
this little pair of glasses.</text><text start="548.37" dur="0.937">And you have to ask it,</text><text start="549.307" dur="2.093">&amp;quot;Hey Meta, what&amp;#39;s the weather tomorrow?&amp;quot;</text><text start="551.4" dur="2.743">And then it reads the answers
directly into your ears.</text><text start="554.143" dur="3.197">And so now I know it&amp;#39;s gonna rain</text><text start="557.34" dur="1.83">for our last parts of the year, great.</text><text start="559.17" dur="3.06">We can also ask it random
questions about people.</text><text start="562.23" dur="2.25">I asked it to write a poem
and it gave me a poem.</text><text start="564.48" dur="1.8">It&amp;#39;s internet connected from your phone,</text><text start="566.28" dur="1.35">so it can do a bunch of stuff.</text><text start="567.63" dur="2.88">For fun, I asked it to write
an acceptance speech for me</text><text start="570.51" dur="2.67">as I walk onto stage
wearing the sunglasses.</text><text start="573.18" dur="1.44">And by the time I got on stage</text><text start="574.62" dur="3.18">I can start saying an acceptance speech</text><text start="577.8" dur="1.29">as it&amp;#39;s reading them into my ears,</text><text start="579.09" dur="2.49">which I thought was,
that&amp;#39;s kind of a fun hack.</text><text start="581.58" dur="4.14">So this is all based on Meta&amp;#39;s
new Llama 2 language model.</text><text start="585.72" dur="2.34">So it&amp;#39;s pretty fluid and you
don&amp;#39;t have to rely on saying</text><text start="588.06" dur="1.95">certain specific phrases to get it to</text><text start="590.01" dur="1.35">keep going through the conversation.</text><text start="591.36" dur="1.89">Now you know, it&amp;#39;s not
the best AI assistant</text><text start="593.25" dur="2.37">I&amp;#39;ve ever heard, and it
still has its limitations,</text><text start="595.62" dur="2.04">it still can&amp;#39;t set alarms,</text><text start="597.66" dur="3.641">or access third party
services that aren&amp;#39;t Meta.</text><text start="601.301" dur="3.86">But the fact that I could
be on a phone call right now</text><text start="605.161" dur="3.985">and you wouldn&amp;#39;t even notice in public,</text><text start="609.146" dur="1.174">that&amp;#39;s kind of the point.</text><text start="610.32" dur="2.82">There&amp;#39;s two different
styles by RayBan for these.</text><text start="613.14" dur="3.21">These are the headliner and the Wayfarer.</text><text start="616.35" dur="2.31">The downside is very clearly battery life.</text><text start="618.66" dur="2.43">I mean, this is a small,
small battery to fit in here.</text><text start="621.09" dur="2.22">So it&amp;#39;s cool that you have
this wireless charging case.</text><text start="623.31" dur="1.41">So the second you take them off,</text><text start="624.72" dur="1.41">you can just put them in the case,</text><text start="626.13" dur="2.82">and charge them back up,
just like earbuds basically.</text><text start="628.95" dur="1.83">So it&amp;#39;s more about how many times</text><text start="630.78" dur="1.65">the case can charge them up.</text><text start="632.43" dur="2.76">Honestly, on one charge, if
I listen to a bunch of music</text><text start="635.19" dur="1.59">and take a bunch of pictures and videos,</text><text start="636.78" dur="2.07">I can kill these things
in under two hours.</text><text start="638.85" dur="3.66">But they&amp;#39;re quoting 36
total hours of battery life</text><text start="642.51" dur="1.17">with the charging case.</text><text start="643.68" dur="1.65">By the way, the recording
light is on one side,</text><text start="645.33" dur="1.89">but then it&amp;#39;s the camera
on the other side.</text><text start="647.22" dur="1.71">So that keeps it nice and symmetrical</text><text start="648.93" dur="1.86">like normal glasses should be.</text><text start="650.79" dur="3.18">But that&amp;#39;s the idea, this
is about as much tech</text><text start="653.97" dur="4">as you can fit in a normal
looking pair of glasses in 2023</text><text start="657.97" dur="2.36">without it starting to look weird</text><text start="660.33" dur="1.14">with the current tech we have,</text><text start="661.47" dur="2.79">but it&amp;#39;s gonna be more
and more and more stuff,</text><text start="664.26" dur="2.1">and still looking like this every year.</text><text start="666.36" dur="3.78">So the question is,
which side would you bet</text><text start="670.14" dur="2.43">gets mass adoption first?</text><text start="672.57" dur="2.79">And this is a question tech
companies have to answer</text><text start="675.36" dur="1.05">before they start investing.</text><text start="676.41" dur="1.86">Now Meta is invested in both.</text><text start="678.27" dur="2.4">So maybe they win either
way and they&amp;#39;re involved.</text><text start="680.67" dur="2.34">But if you&amp;#39;re Snapchat,
they&amp;#39;ve already tried,</text><text start="683.01" dur="1.26">just the smart glasses,</text><text start="684.27" dur="1.71">and maybe they&amp;#39;ll keep doing that later.</text><text start="685.98" dur="2.22">If you&amp;#39;re Apple, they&amp;#39;ve
clearly started with</text><text start="688.2" dur="2.76">Apple Vision Pro, and they&amp;#39;re
gonna try to miniaturize that</text><text start="690.96" dur="1.93">and shrink that year after year.</text><text start="692.89" dur="1.13">But which side?</text><text start="694.02" dur="2.01">And what a time to be
alive for all of this!</text><text start="696.03" dur="2.37">&amp;#39;Cause the tech that we&amp;#39;re
gonna have on our faces</text><text start="698.4" dur="3.51">in 10, 20 years is gonna look insane</text><text start="701.91" dur="1.2">compared to what we have today.</text><text start="703.11" dur="2.099">The same way that the
tech we had 10 years ago</text><text start="705.209" dur="2.881">looks archaic compared
to what we have now.</text><text start="708.09" dur="2.04">So all that being said,
I&amp;#39;ll leave you with this;</text><text start="710.13" dur="3.33">One, Quest 3 for 500 bucks is awesome,</text><text start="713.46" dur="1.62">and if you&amp;#39;re looking to get a VR headset</text><text start="715.08" dur="1.685">or a mixed reality headset at all,</text><text start="716.765" dur="2.76">no problem recommending
this one, it&amp;#39;s pretty sweet.</text><text start="719.525" dur="4.585">Two, Apple&amp;#39;s Vision Pro is still on track</text><text start="724.11" dur="2.46">to be released early 2024,</text><text start="726.57" dur="1.35">and I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be pretty awesome.</text><text start="727.92" dur="1.38">So make sure you get subscribed</text><text start="729.3" dur="2.225">to see the review of that when it happens.</text><text start="731.525" dur="4.345">And three, I&amp;#39;m pretty
sure we are barreling</text><text start="735.87" dur="2.4">towards this computer&amp;#39;s
on our faces future.</text><text start="738.27" dur="2.01">At some point it does
feel like it&amp;#39;s picking up</text><text start="740.28" dur="2.07">that much steam and that much investment.</text><text start="742.35" dur="1.74">So even if you don&amp;#39;t believe</text><text start="744.09" dur="1.95">we&amp;#39;re all gonna be
wearing these on our faces</text><text start="746.04" dur="3.06">for a super long time, it
probably won&amp;#39;t be this,</text><text start="749.1" dur="1.53">it&amp;#39;ll be something smaller,</text><text start="750.63" dur="3.57">and slowly we&amp;#39;ll get more
and more base computer time.</text><text start="754.2" dur="3.693">So which side do you pick?</text><text start="759.03" dur="1.44">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="760.47" dur="1.29">Catch you on the next one.</text><text start="761.76" dur="1.325">Peace.</text><text start="763.085" dur="2.667">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
