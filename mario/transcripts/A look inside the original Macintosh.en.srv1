this place existed.</text><text start="5.204" dur="3.17">- I&amp;#39;m gonna have
  my birthday party here.
- Yeah.</text><text start="8.407" dur="2.036">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="10.476" dur="2.97">Marques invited me to this
incredible vintage warehouse</text><text start="13.479" dur="3.905">that has all kinds
of old Mac computers.</text><text start="19.151" dur="2.97">&lt;i&gt; Specifically, the 1984 Mac,
 which is something&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="22.154" dur="1.235">that has a very special place
in my heart.</text><text start="23.422" dur="2.303">- Yeah, it&amp;#39;s good.
- It&amp;#39;s so great.</text><text start="25.758" dur="1.535">They don&amp;#39;t make &amp;#39;em
like they used to.</text><text start="27.326" dur="1.469">Do you wanna open it up?</text><text start="32.331" dur="2.069">So there are a few screws here.</text><text start="34.433" dur="3.704">- Should we go for it?
- I think we should
  take it apart.</text><text start="38.17" dur="1.369">( muttering )</text><text start="41.574" dur="1.802">All right, final screw.</text><text start="43.409" dur="2.002">- Okay.
- Let&amp;#39;s lift this off.</text><text start="45.444" dur="3.871">Do not touch the CRT coil
because you might get shocked.</text><text start="49.348" dur="2.169">Okay,
inside is the CRT monitor.</text><text start="51.55" dur="3.304">- It goes kinda far
  into the body of it.
- Don&amp;#39;t touch.</text><text start="54.887" dur="2.203">- Okay, I&amp;#39;m not gonna
  touch the CRT coil.
- Don&amp;#39;t. Mm-mm.</text><text start="57.123" dur="1.335">- I&amp;#39;ll hold the bottom down.
- Okay.</text><text start="58.491" dur="2.937">- Ready?
- Yeah, yeah. Moment of truth.</text><text start="62.795" dur="2.636">Oh, man, look at this.</text><text start="65.464" dur="4.805">That is the inside
of a 1984 Mac.</text><text start="70.302" dur="2.203">That&amp;#39;s the coil.
Don&amp;#39;t touch the CRT.</text><text start="72.538" dur="1.869">There are two
different boards.</text><text start="74.44" dur="2.836">There&amp;#39;s, to me unrecognizable,
mostly power components.</text><text start="77.309" dur="2.804">And then there&amp;#39;s also a board
back here at the bottom,</text><text start="80.146" dur="2.402">which has
a lot more soldering.</text><text start="82.581" dur="2.77">- That&amp;#39;s the floppy drive.
- The system disk
  is the floppy disk,</text><text start="85.384" dur="1.469">so that basically
loads it into the RAM.</text><text start="86.886" dur="1.835">And as soon as you take
that disk out, it&amp;#39;s gone.</text><text start="88.754" dur="2.136">You&amp;#39;re basically
loading things as it goes.</text><text start="90.923" dur="2.803">And it would be
a combination of reading</text><text start="93.759" dur="2.67">from the memory that it
has preloaded things into</text><text start="96.462" dur="1.802">and that floppy disk.</text><text start="98.297" dur="3.437">This only had 128K of RAM.</text><text start="101.767" dur="1.869">What, now it&amp;#39;s
a thousand times smaller?</text><text start="103.669" dur="1.969">One front facing selfie
on the iPhone,</text><text start="105.671" dur="1.569">- Yeah?
- you couldn&amp;#39;t even
  fit it on here.</text><text start="107.273" dur="2.336">Like, that&amp;#39;s insane.</text><text start="109.642" dur="3.036">&lt;i&gt; Steve Jobs had created this
 as a work of art.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="112.711" dur="2.937">So, in most art,
people sign them.</text><text start="115.681" dur="2.837">- True.
- So, inside of here
  are autographs</text><text start="118.551" dur="2.97">- of all the people
  that worked on this team.
- Oh, that&amp;#39;s cool.</text><text start="121.554" dur="1.735">- So you can see them
  right there.
- And they&amp;#39;re subtle.</text><text start="123.322" dur="1.468">All these little
inscriptions.</text><text start="124.823" dur="2.337">That&amp;#39;s actually
a nice little touch,
signing your work.</text><text start="127.193" dur="1.501">I&amp;#39;m glad we learned
all this today.</text><text start="128.727" dur="1.969">Thank you so much
for helping me
take apart this Mac</text><text start="130.729" dur="2.036">and for giving me
the breakdown.</text><text start="132.798" dur="1.035">- Appreciate it.
- Thank you so much.</text><text start="133.866" dur="1.469">This was seriously
amazing. Wow.</text></transcript>
