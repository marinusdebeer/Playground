<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.96" dur="1.83">- You know, if you&amp;#39;ve
been watching my videos,</text><text start="2.79" dur="1.26">you&amp;#39;ve noticed a certain sentence</text><text start="4.05" dur="1.8">that I&amp;#39;ve been saying for years.</text><text start="5.85" dur="4.413">I&amp;#39;ve been saying, small flagship
phones are a rare breed.</text><text start="11.1" dur="1.65">And I say that countless
times over the years,</text><text start="12.75" dur="3.033">but today, that&amp;#39;s no longer true.</text><text start="18.87" dur="1.413">That breed is now extinct.</text><text start="21.421" dur="2.732">RIP to the small flagship phone.</text><text start="27.45" dur="1.83">Okay, we don&amp;#39;t even
have to rewind that far</text><text start="29.28" dur="2.88">to the days when phones were
all smaller across the board.</text><text start="32.16" dur="2.67">But then really quickly, we
shot up to four-inch screens,</text><text start="34.83" dur="2.04">then five inch screens were popular,</text><text start="36.87" dur="2.46">then six inch flagships were everywhere.</text><text start="39.33" dur="2.37">We never quite got to seven
inch phones being mainstream,</text><text start="41.7" dur="2.1">but it seems like all of
the biggest flagships now</text><text start="43.8" dur="1.8">are teetering right around that.</text><text start="45.6" dur="2.13">But the funny part is
smartphone manufacturers</text><text start="47.73" dur="3.09">have had the same realization
over and over again,</text><text start="50.82" dur="2.46">which is that, oh, smartphone
screens are getting bigger.</text><text start="53.28" dur="3.24">And so there&amp;#39;s room for the
smaller alternative phone</text><text start="56.52" dur="1.71">to slot in underneath that.</text><text start="58.23" dur="3.63">So like I just reviewed every
single Samsung Galaxy S ever.</text><text start="61.86" dur="1.95">The year that they
started to get really big,</text><text start="63.81" dur="3.24">they, of course, also
introduced a Galaxy S Mini.</text><text start="67.05" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s the most Samsung thing ever.</text><text start="68.73" dur="1.95">But guess what? Now that&amp;#39;s dead.</text><text start="70.68" dur="0.833">Same thing from Apple.</text><text start="71.513" dur="1.627">We finally got huge iPhones,</text><text start="73.14" dur="3.03">and then sure enough, we got
an iPhone Mini for two years,</text><text start="76.17" dur="1.32">but now that&amp;#39;s dead too.</text><text start="77.49" dur="1.71">And this kept happening and
happening all over the place</text><text start="79.2" dur="1.11">until there was basically</text><text start="80.31" dur="4.95">just one good small flagship phone left.</text><text start="85.26" dur="3.78">The Asus Zenfone, the rare breed.</text><text start="89.04" dur="3.42">So this thing, the
Zenfone 9 came out in 2022</text><text start="92.46" dur="3.42">and was a nearly perfect flagship phone.</text><text start="95.88" dur="3.27">Like seriously flagship
specs, incredible performance,</text><text start="99.15" dur="3.51">physics defying battery life,
like rock solid cameras.</text><text start="102.66" dur="3.36">This phone won my small phone
of the year by a landslide,</text><text start="106.02" dur="2.16">even with the few tiny
flaws it had, you know,</text><text start="108.18" dur="2.76">the back material being
a little less durable</text><text start="110.94" dur="1.5">and it didn&amp;#39;t have wireless charging.</text><text start="112.44" dur="2.58">So then in 2023, they
came out with a sequel,</text><text start="115.02" dur="1.11">the Zenfone 10.</text><text start="116.13" dur="2.85">And that took a good thing
and basically perfected it.</text><text start="118.98" dur="1.68">They fixed the back material,</text><text start="120.66" dur="2.37">they gave it wireless
charging, they upgraded it</text><text start="123.03" dur="1.44">to the latest flagship chips.</text><text start="124.47" dur="2.18">They didn&amp;#39;t lose anything.
Nothing went wrong.</text><text start="126.65" dur="3.91">It was just this singular,
excellent flagship phone</text><text start="130.56" dur="2.97">with a less than six inch screen in 2023.</text><text start="133.53" dur="2.19">So now it&amp;#39;s 2024,</text><text start="135.72" dur="5">and the new Zenfone is a
gigantic 6.8 inch ultra phone.</text><text start="143.79" dur="2.07">Now, honestly, we probably</text><text start="145.86" dur="1.53">should have seen this coming, right?</text><text start="147.39" dur="2.91">When has a small flagship ever lasted</text><text start="150.3" dur="2.1">more than a year or two, right?</text><text start="152.4" dur="1.83">But it just, I don&amp;#39;t know,
it hits a little harder</text><text start="154.23" dur="2.22">when this was the last small one.</text><text start="156.45" dur="2.49">Like here&amp;#39;s something
to think about, right?</text><text start="158.94" dur="4.02">I think Apple is, you could
argue, one of the best</text><text start="162.96" dur="3.15">supply chain companies
in the world, right?</text><text start="166.11" dur="1.29">That&amp;#39;s how they built their business.</text><text start="167.4" dur="3.78">That&amp;#39;s how Tim Cook took the
stock price from here to here.</text><text start="171.18" dur="3.24">That&amp;#39;s what they do. Tim
Cook is the supply chain guy.</text><text start="174.42" dur="2.61">So every time they come
out with a new product</text><text start="177.03" dur="1.11">or a range of products,</text><text start="178.14" dur="1.74">they have to do the supply chain thing</text><text start="179.88" dur="3.03">and figure out exactly how
many they need to produce.</text><text start="182.91" dur="2.16">So they have these complex studies</text><text start="185.07" dur="1.32">and they&amp;#39;re ways of estimating</text><text start="186.39" dur="3.03">how many they think will be
sold of every single SKU.</text><text start="189.42" dur="1.83">And then that&amp;#39;s how
many they need to make.</text><text start="191.25" dur="2.88">Not too many, just the perfect amount,</text><text start="194.13" dur="2.28">perfect inventory management.</text><text start="196.41" dur="2.91">That&amp;#39;s the supply chain thing.
That&amp;#39;s Tim Cook&amp;#39;s thing.</text><text start="199.32" dur="2.94">So in 2020, for the first
time, Apple decided to release</text><text start="202.26" dur="2.25">a new lineup of four new iPhones.</text><text start="204.51" dur="4.17">It was iPhone 12, iPhone
12 Pro, the 12 Pro Max,</text><text start="208.68" dur="1.41">and the 12 Mini.</text><text start="210.09" dur="2.43">Of course, the 12 and the
12 Pro are the same size,</text><text start="212.52" dur="1.62">right in the middle, this
nice little sweet spot</text><text start="214.14" dur="2.79">of the lineup, and the
12 Pro Max just being</text><text start="216.93" dur="3.75">this absolute maxed out,
biggest screen, biggest price.</text><text start="220.68" dur="2.94">But then the cheapest
most pocketable new iPhone</text><text start="223.62" dur="2.88">in the lineup is this cute
new little Mini phone.</text><text start="226.5" dur="4.02">Now, Apple, Tim Cook, the all
the supply chain knowledge</text><text start="230.52" dur="1.2">and the studies they&amp;#39;ve put in,</text><text start="231.72" dur="4.32">they already know small phones
don&amp;#39;t sell particularly well.</text><text start="236.04" dur="2.19">So they make all of their changes</text><text start="238.23" dur="3.72">and line up how many of each
they&amp;#39;re going to produce.</text><text start="241.95" dur="2.55">And then they send it, they
send it all into production.</text><text start="244.5" dur="2.28">And you know, reviews,
honestly, for the most part,</text><text start="246.78" dur="1.62">were super positive across the board.</text><text start="248.4" dur="1.32">People love the Mini phone.</text><text start="249.72" dur="3.06">Yes, the battery life is
weaker on the smaller phone,</text><text start="252.78" dur="3.75">but to put a flagship
shape and a flagship chip</text><text start="256.53" dur="2.7">and a flagship camera in a Mini phone,</text><text start="259.23" dur="1.59">it is just such a rare thing.</text><text start="260.82" dur="1.98">So it was extremely well received.</text><text start="262.8" dur="2.73">Tech reviewers love it.
Real users are loving it.</text><text start="265.53" dur="1.74">YouTube videos are loving on the thing.</text><text start="267.27" dur="5">And the Mini iPhone still
sold dramatically less</text><text start="272.97" dur="2.28">than what Apple had prepared for it to.</text><text start="275.25" dur="4.11">There are some surveys that
have the Mini iPhone at like 5%</text><text start="279.36" dur="3.06">of the total sales of the
entire new iPhone 12 lineup,</text><text start="282.42" dur="1.2">sometimes even less.</text><text start="283.62" dur="2.67">I mean, it was really, really unpopular</text><text start="286.29" dur="1.17">in the grand scheme of things</text><text start="287.46" dur="3.39">to actually buy an iPhone 12 Mini.</text><text start="290.85" dur="2.73">So suddenly it went from being
the darling of the lineup</text><text start="293.58" dur="3.42">to the least successful
new iPhone of all time.</text><text start="297" dur="2.22">And the headlines were all over this</text><text start="299.22" dur="2.64">and sort of wondering if they
would even try this again.</text><text start="301.86" dur="2.67">And they did for one more year,
they did an iPhone 13 Mini.</text><text start="304.53" dur="1.83">It did even worse than the 12 Mini.</text><text start="306.36" dur="1.92">And then it was quietly discontinued.</text><text start="308.28" dur="2.19">And guess what was in its place?</text><text start="310.47" dur="3.51">A brand new plus sized
iPhone. Because of course.</text><text start="313.98" dur="2.79">So the moral of the story is
the Mini iPhone experiment</text><text start="316.77" dur="3.69">reinforced what we already
knew, which is not enough people</text><text start="320.46" dur="4.23">actually buy small phones
to be worth it for a company</text><text start="324.69" dur="2.91">even of Apple size, to
put in all the research</text><text start="327.6" dur="1.89">and development to keep
making these things.</text><text start="329.49" dur="0.833">Like some people think,</text><text start="330.323" dur="1.417">oh, this thing is
getting positive reviews,</text><text start="331.74" dur="1.17">so it must be a success.</text><text start="332.91" dur="1.14">Not always true.</text><text start="334.05" dur="3">And also the counter, if things
are getting negative reviews</text><text start="337.05" dur="2.97">from YouTubers, that must be why it died.</text><text start="340.02" dur="1.08">Also, not always true.</text><text start="341.1" dur="1.44">So now here we go with the Zenfone.</text><text start="342.54" dur="3.15">Now, here&amp;#39;s the thing, not to
discount the Zenfone 11 ultra,</text><text start="345.69" dur="1.62">it&amp;#39;s actually a really good phone.</text><text start="347.31" dur="3.06">In fact, it&amp;#39;s a perfectly
fine, large flagship phone.</text><text start="350.37" dur="2.1">It brings all the good
things about Zenfone 10</text><text start="352.47" dur="3.72">to a bigger scale, bigger
battery, awesome battery life.</text><text start="356.19" dur="3.15">The latest chips and specs,
again, lightweight software</text><text start="359.34" dur="2.34">and smooth performance,
rock solid cameras.</text><text start="361.68" dur="2.79">It actually added a
third telephoto camera.</text><text start="364.47" dur="1.02">So it&amp;#39;s all here.</text><text start="365.49" dur="2.16">It just loses the biggest thing,</text><text start="367.65" dur="3.03">or I guess the smallest thing
that really made it different.</text><text start="370.68" dur="2.31">Just the fact that it was actually small</text><text start="372.99" dur="1.74">and reachable from corner to corner</text><text start="374.73" dur="1.71">and didn&amp;#39;t require huge pockets</text><text start="376.44" dur="2.34">or huge hands to comfortably dil it.</text><text start="378.78" dur="1.41">All of that is gone.</text><text start="380.19" dur="4.65">And now it&amp;#39;s just like a ROG
phone minus the gamer stuff.</text><text start="384.84" dur="2.4">Actually, seriously, that&amp;#39;s
basically what it is.</text><text start="387.24" dur="2.81">This is the new Zenfone
next to the new ROG phone.</text><text start="390.05" dur="2.44">If you take away the screen on the back,</text><text start="392.49" dur="3.84">the 165 hertz display, the side USBC port,</text><text start="396.33" dur="1.8">the shoulder triggers,</text><text start="398.13" dur="2.73">honestly, it&amp;#39;s basically the same phone.</text><text start="400.86" dur="2.73">So this Zenfone just
feels like it&amp;#39;s blending</text><text start="403.59" dur="2.34">into the sea of other giant phones.</text><text start="405.93" dur="3.69">If I was guessing,
Zenfone 9 and Zenfone 10,</text><text start="409.62" dur="3.81">despite how much we loved
them, didn&amp;#39;t sell very well.</text><text start="413.43" dur="2.88">And so they moved on,
kind of the same way,</text><text start="416.31" dur="2.88">that iPhone 12 Mini and 13 Mini</text><text start="419.19" dur="1.74">didn&amp;#39;t sell particularly well.</text><text start="420.93" dur="3.21">The last part of that equation,
the fun fact is, even today,</text><text start="424.14" dur="4.32">the most popular new iPhone
is still the Pro and Pro Max,</text><text start="428.46" dur="2.49">the super high end biggest phone.</text><text start="430.95" dur="2.16">And so what did Asus do?</text><text start="433.11" dur="3.78">They made a super high-end big phone.</text><text start="436.89" dur="1.98">Now, to be perfectly super clear,</text><text start="438.87" dur="2.19">Asus technically hasn&amp;#39;t confirmed</text><text start="441.06" dur="3.18">that they&amp;#39;re not going to
make a regular Zenfone 11,</text><text start="444.24" dur="4.14">but the body language suggests
that this is the only one.</text><text start="448.38" dur="2.67">They just sort rename it the way Apple</text><text start="451.05" dur="2.37">just stopped making the Mini
and started making a Plus.</text><text start="453.42" dur="1.29">We just assume the Mini&amp;#39;s gone.</text><text start="454.71" dur="1.47">So there&amp;#39;s no solution to this.</text><text start="456.18" dur="5">It&amp;#39;s right in line with the
enthusiast phone dilemma.</text><text start="461.82" dur="2.13">Whenever a phone manufacturer comes along</text><text start="463.95" dur="1.8">and starts making an enthusiast phone,</text><text start="465.75" dur="3.15">it gathers a really, really hot audience</text><text start="468.9" dur="2.7">for that specific device, but it&amp;#39;s small,</text><text start="471.6" dur="1.62">and so when they end
up trying to branch out</text><text start="473.22" dur="3">and make it more successful,
they lose the core fans.</text><text start="476.22" dur="2.64">And I don&amp;#39;t know if this Zenfone&amp;#39;s
gonna lose the core fans,</text><text start="478.86" dur="1.59">but people who liked it for being small</text><text start="480.45" dur="2.4">certainly aren&amp;#39;t gonna
like this one anymore.</text><text start="482.85" dur="2.49">And this even applies
to budget phones too.</text><text start="485.34" dur="2.19">You know, small budget
phones are getting bigger.</text><text start="487.53" dur="2.82">Pixel 7A is a 6.1 inch phone.</text><text start="490.35" dur="1.77">The Nothing Phone 2a that just came out</text><text start="492.12" dur="2.55">is literally an ultra sized phone.</text><text start="494.67" dur="2.79">And rumors of the next
iPhone SE also point</text><text start="497.46" dur="1.98">to that being not small.</text><text start="499.44" dur="1.89">So the void is now open.</text><text start="501.33" dur="1.29">You know, someone might
come along and make</text><text start="502.62" dur="3.39">another small flagship phone
to briefly fill that void,</text><text start="506.01" dur="3.513">but don&amp;#39;t expect it to last too long.</text><text start="510.633" dur="3.316">RIP, the small flagship phone.</text><text start="513.949" dur="2.583">(light music)</text></transcript>
