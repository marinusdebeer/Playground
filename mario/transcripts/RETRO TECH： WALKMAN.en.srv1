  Nice to meet you.</text><text start="4.804" dur="1.335">- Good to meet you, Ryan.
- Thank you.</text><text start="6.172" dur="1.501">Good to see you.
So in this box</text><text start="7.706" dur="3.705">is a milestone piece of tech.</text><text start="11.444" dur="1.769">I just want to have you open it
and give me your thoughts.</text><text start="14.48" dur="2.903">- Ooh.
- ( laughs )</text><text start="17.416" dur="2.069">- I love these.
- It&amp;#39;s so cool-looking.</text><text start="19.518" dur="1.636">This is definitely
older than me.</text><text start="21.187" dur="1.368">I&amp;#39;ve never actually
seen one of these.</text><text start="22.588" dur="2.203">You want to give it a spin?</text><text start="24.824" dur="2.669">This is functioning?</text><text start="27.526" dur="3.271">&lt;i&gt; ( synth rock playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="40.573" dur="1.068">That&amp;#39;s extremely cool.</text><text start="45.511" dur="3.804">&lt;i&gt; I&amp;#39;m Marques Brownlee
 and I review dope new tech.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="49.348" dur="3.003">&lt;i&gt; But on this show,
 I&amp;#39;m rewinding the clock&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="52.384" dur="2.07">&lt;i&gt; to discover
 the tech of the past&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="54.487" dur="3.17">&lt;i&gt; that changed
 our lives forever.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="57.69" dur="4.004">&lt;i&gt; This is
 &amp;quot;Retro Tech: Walkman.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="61.727" dur="2.47">Hey, what&amp;#39;s up, guys?
MKBHD here.</text><text start="64.23" dur="3.871">So, spoiler alert,
I&amp;#39;ve never used a Walkman.</text><text start="68.134" dur="1.368">I&amp;#39;m very unfamiliar with it.</text><text start="69.535" dur="1.001">and this will be literally</text><text start="70.569" dur="2.27">my first time ever seeing it.</text><text start="72.872" dur="2.502">The first ever
portable music player,</text><text start="75.407" dur="4.972">Sony introduced
the TPS-L2 Walkman in 1979</text><text start="80.412" dur="1.836">and changed
the music game forever.</text><text start="82.281" dur="1.268">I wasn&amp;#39;t alive back then.</text><text start="83.582" dur="2.303">In fact,
half of people alive now</text><text start="85.918" dur="2.97">were not alive when
the Walkman was introduced.</text><text start="88.921" dur="1.936">Also, this pink text
is not an accident.</text><text start="90.89" dur="1.668">It&amp;#39;s everywhere.</text><text start="92.591" dur="2.303">So let&amp;#39;s go ahead
and get one out the box.</text><text start="94.927" dur="2.336">Paperwork-- this has never
gone out of style.</text><text start="97.296" dur="2.57">Whoa.
These are the headphones.</text><text start="99.899" dur="2.336">Flimsy. Very lightweight.</text><text start="102.268" dur="2.937">That just leaves
the Walkman itself.</text><text start="106.438" dur="1.936">In a leather case--</text><text start="108.407" dur="2.937">this is like
a little pocketbook.</text><text start="111.377" dur="2.035">Oh, my gosh.</text><text start="113.445" dur="1.736">It&amp;#39;s pretty chunky.</text><text start="115.214" dur="2.169">AA batteries.</text><text start="117.416" dur="2.203">Tactile buttons.</text><text start="119.652" dur="2.936">So that&amp;#39;s your fast-forward,
your rewind.</text><text start="122.621" dur="1.903">Play/pause. Stop.</text><text start="124.557" dur="4.137">Immensely satisfying.
You don&amp;#39;t get that today.</text><text start="128.727" dur="2.703">So there&amp;#39;s only
one more thing to do,</text><text start="131.463" dur="2.904">and that is
listen to some music.</text><text start="134.4" dur="1.869">Beastie Boys.</text><text start="142.641" dur="1.87">Oh, I have to struggle
with everything, don&amp;#39;t I?</text><text start="147.279" dur="0.935">Nope.</text><text start="150.783" dur="2.103">I just want to play my tape.</text><text start="155.654" dur="2.303">Ah.</text><text start="157.99" dur="2.303">This little bracket down here?</text><text start="160.326" dur="2.236">Go ahead and slide it in
on that bracket.</text><text start="166.665" dur="2.937">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="171.337" dur="1.969">Whew.</text><text start="173.339" dur="1.501">Wow. These actually
don&amp;#39;t sound bad.</text><text start="174.873" dur="1.936">&lt;i&gt; ( music continues )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="176.842" dur="3.704">&lt;i&gt; This year is the 40th
 anniversary of the Walkman,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="180.579" dur="1.736">&lt;i&gt; and I want to know
 how this piece of tech&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="182.348" dur="3.003">&lt;i&gt; jumpstarted portable music
 as we know it today.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="185.384" dur="2.036">&lt;i&gt; ( music stops )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="187.453" dur="2.369">- Hey. Marques.
- Hey, Marques. Americus.</text><text start="189.855" dur="1.569">- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.</text><text start="191.457" dur="2.402">- Wow.
- All right.</text><text start="193.892" dur="2.37">So to start off,
I&amp;#39;m going to have you
check under your seat.</text><text start="196.295" dur="1.101">- Like, right now?
- Go ahead.</text><text start="197.429" dur="1.502">- Oh, no.
- Aah!</text><text start="198.964" dur="1.369">This is pretty cool.</text><text start="200.366" dur="1.535">Wow.</text><text start="201.934" dur="1.435">This brings back memories.</text><text start="203.402" dur="2.036">This guy!</text><text start="205.471" dur="2.369">I have not seen
one of these things</text><text start="207.873" dur="1.836">in I don&amp;#39;t even know
how long.</text><text start="209.742" dur="2.102">Fits perfect, yeah.</text><text start="211.877" dur="2.036">Wow. This is pretty dope, man.</text><text start="215.581" dur="2.269">Can you take me
back to the &amp;#39;70s</text><text start="217.883" dur="2.47">and what the world
of the audio was like</text><text start="220.386" dur="1.301">before the Walkman existed?</text><text start="221.72" dur="1.802">Yeah,
the world of audio was fun</text><text start="223.555" dur="1.969">because there was
a sort of preference</text><text start="225.557" dur="1.302">for stuff getting bigger.</text><text start="226.892" dur="1.936">You know,
you wanted music to be loud,</text><text start="228.861" dur="0.968">you wanted it to be booming.</text><text start="229.862" dur="1.135">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="231.03" dur="1.001">&lt;i&gt; ♪ Everybody ♪&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="232.064" dur="0.968">Seth:
Before Walkmen,</text><text start="233.065" dur="2.87">music was innately social,</text><text start="235.968" dur="1.735">blaring into
the communal airwaves.</text><text start="237.736" dur="1.769">People carried
around boom boxes.</text><text start="239.538" dur="2.002">Boom boxes were the thing.</text><text start="241.573" dur="1.703">The bigger it was,
the cooler you were.</text><text start="243.309" dur="1.735">Man on TV:
The radio that&amp;#39;s about as big</text><text start="245.077" dur="1.468">as the Empire State Building</text><text start="246.578" dur="1.969">and as loud as World War II.</text><text start="248.58" dur="2.136">They were big, and they were
cumbersome to carry around.</text><text start="250.749" dur="2.136">It definitely
was not the type of device</text><text start="252.918" dur="2.803">that would fit in your pocket,
or even in a backpack.</text><text start="255.754" dur="1.969">So the heads of Sony
had an idea,</text><text start="257.756" dur="1.969">and the idea was let&amp;#39;s see</text><text start="259.758" dur="2.27">if we can make things
a bit more mobile,</text><text start="262.061" dur="2.236">so suddenly smaller
becomes better.</text><text start="264.33" dur="1.568">Lisa:
Portable cassette players</text><text start="265.931" dur="2.002">definitely existed
before the Walkman,</text><text start="267.966" dur="1.769">but they were very different.</text><text start="269.768" dur="2.637">Some of them
were the size of VCRs</text><text start="272.438" dur="2.603">and they had these big
chunky buttons.</text><text start="275.074" dur="1.902">But they weren&amp;#39;t
for listening to music.</text><text start="277.009" dur="2.036">They were for journalists
and secretaries.</text><text start="279.078" dur="2.769">So the heads of Sony
had an idea.</text><text start="281.88" dur="2.47">Can you walk me through
the origin story of the Walkman?</text><text start="284.383" dur="2.536">Seth:
So the founder of Sony</text><text start="286.952" dur="1.702">was a huge audiophile.</text><text start="288.687" dur="1.235">He loved opera music.</text><text start="289.955" dur="3.504">And he&amp;#39;s taking
this old cassette player</text><text start="293.492" dur="2.937">that&amp;#39;s designed
for recording notes
as a journalist might</text><text start="296.462" dur="3.237">and using that on the road
to listen to his opera music.</text><text start="299.732" dur="2.202">&lt;i&gt; ( opera music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="301.967" dur="1.535">And he finds
this thing clunky.</text><text start="303.535" dur="1.869">It&amp;#39;s totally impractical.</text><text start="305.437" dur="1.469">There has to be a better way.</text><text start="306.939" dur="3.003">Lisa:
Masaru Ibuka tasked his team</text><text start="309.975" dur="1.736">to come up with a solution.</text><text start="311.744" dur="2.336">Seth: So they start
stripping away components.</text><text start="314.113" dur="1.501">They start stripping
away parts.</text><text start="315.647" dur="2.37">All the gears and gadgetry
and equipment</text><text start="318.05" dur="1.902">necessary to record
onto a tape?</text><text start="319.985" dur="1.635">They get rid of that.</text><text start="321.653" dur="2.804">And what they&amp;#39;re left with
is a small,</text><text start="324.49" dur="1.969">sleek, portable device</text><text start="326.492" dur="1.969">that does basically one thing,</text><text start="328.494" dur="2.302">but does that one thing
really well.</text><text start="330.829" dur="3.137">It lets you listen to music.</text><text start="333.999" dur="2.103">Lisa: And in 1979,
the Walkman was born.</text><text start="336.135" dur="2.303">&lt;i&gt; ( opera music ends )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="341.874" dur="1.101">Marques:
I wanted to learn even more</text><text start="343.008" dur="1.435">about the origin
of the Walkman,</text><text start="344.476" dur="1.636">so I got in touch
with Toshio Asai,</text><text start="346.145" dur="2.336">who was an engineer on
the original development team</text><text start="348.514" dur="3.337">for the Walkman
at Sony in Tokyo.</text><text start="351.884" dur="2.937">( speaking Japanese )</text><text start="373.705" dur="1.269">( speaking Japanese )</text><text start="406.138" dur="2.336">Marques:
The engineers at Sony
did such a good job</text><text start="408.507" dur="2.169">building the Walkman
that consumers would keep them</text><text start="410.709" dur="2.103">even if they broke.</text><text start="412.845" dur="3.17">Nowadays, if our tech breaks,
we bring it in to be fixed.</text><text start="416.048" dur="2.903">But back then, everyone was
apparently pretty handy.</text><text start="418.984" dur="1.735">So I&amp;#39;ve invited
my friend Judner,</text><text start="420.752" dur="2.97">AKA &amp;quot;UrAvgConsumer,&amp;quot;
to help me out.</text><text start="423.755" dur="2.136">Between the two of us,
we have more than enough knowhow</text><text start="425.924" dur="2.136">to get into this tech.</text><text start="428.093" dur="2.603">- Thanks for joining me today.
- Thanks for having me, man.</text><text start="430.729" dur="3.037">We&amp;#39;re both YouTube creators.
We&amp;#39;re both tech heads.</text><text start="433.799" dur="2.936">We&amp;#39;re both born after
the Walkman came out.</text><text start="436.768" dur="2.07">- This is heavy.
- Yeah.</text><text start="438.871" dur="1.835">So, what do you know
about the Walkman?</text><text start="440.739" dur="1.836">- I know they use tapes.
- Mm-hmm.</text><text start="442.608" dur="3.604">But outside of that?
Not too much.</text><text start="446.245" dur="2.336">Okay. So, we review
a lot of tech.</text><text start="448.614" dur="1.969">When&amp;#39;s the last time
you actually had to go in</text><text start="450.616" dur="2.436">and replace or fix something?</text><text start="454.62" dur="1.602">I don&amp;#39;t think I ever have.</text><text start="456.255" dur="1.368">I can&amp;#39;t think of any time</text><text start="457.656" dur="1.969">I have actually
had to personally do it.</text><text start="459.658" dur="2.87">So, one of the most common
problems with these Walkmen,</text><text start="462.561" dur="3.203">the bands inside
that turn the tapes
and make them move...</text><text start="465.797" dur="1.135">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="466.965" dur="1.969">...would sometimes
stretch or break.</text><text start="468.967" dur="1.068">&lt;i&gt; ( music stops )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="470.068" dur="1.602">So, with the right
instructions,</text><text start="471.703" dur="3.938">can these Walkmen be fixed
by your average consumer?</text><text start="475.674" dur="2.336">- Sounds good.
- I guess we&amp;#39;ll figure
  that out pretty soon.</text><text start="478.043" dur="2.803">All right,
let&amp;#39;s jump right in.</text><text start="480.879" dur="3.204">Step one, remove
the first set of screws
from the side panel.</text><text start="484.116" dur="4.438">- That&amp;#39;s simple enough.
- Keep these screws safe.</text><text start="488.587" dur="3.037">All right,
I&amp;#39;ve got doors coming off,</text><text start="491.657" dur="1.568">Oh!</text><text start="493.258" dur="2.703">Look at the guts
of that thing.</text><text start="495.994" dur="2.937">If I had to defuse a bomb
and it looked like this?</text><text start="498.964" dur="2.269">We&amp;#39;re all gonna die.</text><text start="501.266" dur="2.703">There are 20 gears in here
and a motor.</text><text start="504.002" dur="2.97">That&amp;#39;s something
you don&amp;#39;t see in today&amp;#39;s tech.</text><text start="507.005" dur="2.537">- Oh, there we go.
- That&amp;#39;s your band.</text><text start="509.575" dur="1.568">This is completely snapped.</text><text start="511.176" dur="2.737">As far as my appreciation
for old tech right now?</text><text start="513.946" dur="1.868">I&amp;#39;m not sure
if this is making me</text><text start="515.847" dur="4.806">appreciate it more or less.</text><text start="520.686" dur="1.301">I think I&amp;#39;d appreciate</text><text start="522.02" dur="1.969">the person
who could do this for me.</text><text start="524.022" dur="1.869">True.</text><text start="525.924" dur="1.636">This brings me
back to high school.</text><text start="527.593" dur="2.469">There&amp;#39;s the second screw.</text><text start="530.095" dur="1.902">Whew. There goes
the whole plate.</text><text start="532.03" dur="1.869">I&amp;#39;m going to get it, though.</text><text start="533.932" dur="1.969">Oh! There we go.</text><text start="535.934" dur="3.27">So this is that big band.
It&amp;#39;s a little stretched out.</text><text start="539.237" dur="2.437">( light clatter )</text><text start="541.707" dur="2.069">That sounded like a screw.</text><text start="543.809" dur="1.502">Oh, no.</text><text start="545.344" dur="2.436">Anyone have a giant magnet?
I think I&amp;#39;m going to</text><text start="547.813" dur="1.769">have to finish this
without that one screw,</text><text start="549.615" dur="2.202">but I&amp;#39;m going to commandeer
some of this extra tape</text><text start="551.85" dur="3.003">- so that the bracket stays.
- Oh, okay, MacGyver.</text><text start="554.886" dur="1.736">- You know who MacGyver is?
- Yep.</text><text start="556.655" dur="1.368">- Do you really?
- Nope.</text><text start="558.056" dur="1.802">Uh-huh.</text><text start="559.891" dur="4.939">So, replace the big band
with this new big band.</text><text start="564.863" dur="2.336">This has got to go
right over the top here.</text><text start="567.232" dur="2.036">Boom! First band done.</text><text start="569.301" dur="1.802">Your board is
all over the place.</text><text start="571.136" dur="2.47">Yeah, this is--
it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m dissecting
a frog here.</text><text start="573.639" dur="2.569">- Oh, man.
- I did not follow
  instructions.</text><text start="579.244" dur="1.102">- Whoa.
- ( light clatter )</text><text start="580.379" dur="2.302">No!</text><text start="582.714" dur="1.269">Was that a screw
you just dropped?</text><text start="589.421" dur="3.337">This is a lot more steps
than I was imagining.</text><text start="592.791" dur="2.203">Control panel back.</text><text start="595.027" dur="1.868">All right,
I finally reached the point</text><text start="596.928" dur="4.272">where I can test to see
if I&amp;#39;ve installed
the bands correctly</text><text start="601.233" dur="1.935">and if that one screw
was optional.</text><text start="603.201" dur="3.871">We&amp;#39;ll see.
It&amp;#39;s not completely
put back together,</text><text start="607.105" dur="2.803">but if this works,</text><text start="609.941" dur="3.071">it says a lot about
my progress so far,
I&amp;#39;m just saying.</text><text start="615.047" dur="2.303">Let me jump in on this
to verify.</text><text start="619.951" dur="1.969">Okay, please work.
Please work.</text><text start="621.953" dur="2.236">- Play.

appreciated the Walkman</text><text start="673.238" dur="2.102">when it first came out.</text><text start="675.373" dur="2.003">Seth: People were up in arms
over the Walkman.</text><text start="677.409" dur="1.702">They just simply
thought it was unsafe.</text><text start="679.144" dur="2.002">They thought if people
weren&amp;#39;t paying attention,</text><text start="681.179" dur="1.636">they would get hit by cars.</text><text start="682.848" dur="1.468">There was a lot of backlash.</text><text start="684.349" dur="1.936">This one of the first times
that we saw technology</text><text start="686.318" dur="2.736">allow you to close off
the world.</text><text start="689.087" dur="2.236">Man on TV:
Is it the Me Generation
gone wild?</text><text start="691.356" dur="2.47">A height of anti-social
behavior?</text><text start="693.859" dur="2.135">There were all sorts
of anti-Walkman rules</text><text start="696.027" dur="1.769">kind of popping up everywhere.</text><text start="697.829" dur="3.004">The most prominent was in
Woodbridge, New Jersey, 1982.</text><text start="700.866" dur="3.303">The town passes a law
that basically bans you</text><text start="704.202" dur="2.169">from listening to Walkmen
while you&amp;#39;re crossing streets</text><text start="706.404" dur="1.369">and doing a bunch
of other things.</text><text start="707.806" dur="1.535">We are trying
to stop a tragedy</text><text start="709.374" dur="1.802">before it happens
in Woodbridge.</text><text start="711.209" dur="4.639">To this day, this Walkman ban
still stands in New Jersey.</text><text start="715.881" dur="1.902">Having a Walkman
wasn&amp;#39;t immediately cool.</text><text start="717.816" dur="1.535">This was a novel device.</text><text start="719.384" dur="1.936">People would be staring at you
if you wore it.</text><text start="721.353" dur="2.503">So what Sony wanted to do</text><text start="723.889" dur="1.501">was to try
to turn those stares</text><text start="725.423" dur="2.07">from bad stares
to good stares.</text><text start="727.526" dur="2.836">So the ad campaigns,
the marketing campaign,</text><text start="730.395" dur="1.669">it was all about featuring fun,</text><text start="732.097" dur="3.404">hip, attractive-looking people
using Walkmen in public</text><text start="735.534" dur="2.669">so that people would think it
was an acceptable thing to do.</text><text start="738.236" dur="4.805">Announcer:
The tiny stereo cassette player
with truly incredible sound.</text><text start="743.074" dur="1.335">Lisa: Sony&amp;#39;s early ads</text><text start="744.442" dur="2.603">showed people dancing
out in the streets,</text><text start="747.078" dur="1.469">and the tagline said,</text><text start="748.58" dur="1.602">&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a revolution
in the streets.&amp;quot;</text><text start="750.215" dur="1.302">Because it was
so new to people.</text><text start="751.55" dur="1.602">People weren&amp;#39;t
used to the idea</text><text start="753.185" dur="1.268">of bringing
their music around.</text><text start="754.486" dur="0.968">They probably
didn&amp;#39;t even realize</text><text start="755.487" dur="1.468">that they wanted to bring</text><text start="756.988" dur="1.903">their music around
before the Walkman.</text><text start="758.924" dur="2.469">It&amp;#39;s like carrying
your stereo with you,
you know?</text><text start="761.426" dur="1.969">On your-- on your head.</text><text start="763.428" dur="2.636">Sony&amp;#39;s idea was we&amp;#39;re going to
put them in the hands</text><text start="766.097" dur="2.17">of some of the top people
in the industry.</text><text start="768.3" dur="1.935">Lisa:
You saw really prominent</text><text start="770.268" dur="2.236">famous people wearing it.</text><text start="772.537" dur="2.67">It was very similar to what
a lot of companies do today,</text><text start="775.24" dur="2.002">except now it&amp;#39;s called
influence marketing,</text><text start="777.275" dur="2.27">and it&amp;#39;s mostly done
on Instagram.</text><text start="779.578" dur="2.669">And this worked.
Eventually, the Walkman</text><text start="782.28" dur="2.803">became something
you wanted to show off.</text><text start="785.116" dur="2.403">But one of the big problems</text><text start="787.552" dur="1.469">with any piece
of portable gear</text><text start="789.054" dur="1.502">is that you&amp;#39;re not social.</text><text start="790.589" dur="2.002">You&amp;#39;re kind of isolated
from the world around you.</text><text start="792.624" dur="1.936">So, what Sony did is they put</text><text start="794.593" dur="1.635">his and hers
headphone jacks on it</text><text start="796.261" dur="2.169">so that two people
could listen at once.</text><text start="798.463" dur="2.603">So, suddenly,
this solo activity</text><text start="801.099" dur="1.802">could be a couples&amp;#39; activity.</text><text start="802.934" dur="1.168">You could listen
to a song with your friend</text><text start="804.135" dur="1.969">and share it with them.</text><text start="806.137" dur="2.036">The Walkman also a had
a hot line button</text><text start="808.206" dur="1.936">that when you press it,</text><text start="810.175" dur="2.102">allowed you to speak to someone
else through the device</text><text start="812.31" dur="2.837">and it lowered the music
a little bit, too.</text><text start="815.18" dur="1.435">I left my Walkman
headphones at home,</text><text start="816.648" dur="4.638">but I do have this pair
of 2018 headphones.</text><text start="821.319" dur="1.969">We can do some hot line.
Let&amp;#39;s go ahead and hit play.</text><text start="823.321" dur="2.67">- Okay.
-&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="826.024" dur="1.836">My ears.</text><text start="827.893" dur="2.202">Oh, the mic&amp;#39;s up here.
Can you hear me?</text><text start="830.128" dur="1.802">- Yeah! Yeah.
- Did it work?</text><text start="831.963" dur="1.502">- This is weird.
- It lowered my volume
  and yours.</text><text start="833.498" dur="1.469">That&amp;#39;s kind of brilliant.</text><text start="835" dur="1.635">♪ What&amp;#39;s love got to do ♪</text><text start="836.668" dur="1.902">♪ Got to do ♪</text><text start="838.603" dur="2.003">- It doesn&amp;#39;t totally mute it.
- Yeah.</text><text start="840.639" dur="1.668">- It just lowers it.
- It lowers it.</text><text start="842.34" dur="2.537">When headphones are new,
when Walkmen are new.</text><text start="844.91" dur="1.568">people tend to talk
at a higher volume</text><text start="846.511" dur="1.135">- when you have headphones on.
- Definitely.</text><text start="847.679" dur="1.635">Before the Walkman,
stereo was, like,</text><text start="849.347" dur="2.036">it was cool,
but it wasn&amp;#39;t this headphone,</text><text start="851.416" dur="1.569">immersive experience.</text><text start="853.018" dur="1.134">- Right.
- That&amp;#39;s what the Walkman did.</text><text start="854.185" dur="1.803">That&amp;#39;s amazing.</text><text start="856.021" dur="2.536">Lisa: Although the Walkman
gets a lot of the credit,</text><text start="858.59" dur="1.902">the headphones
that Sony designed</text><text start="860.525" dur="2.37">really played into
the Walkman&amp;#39;s success.</text><text start="862.928" dur="4.037">Before the Walkman came out,
headphones were big</text><text start="866.998" dur="2.503">and they weren&amp;#39;t really designed
to be carried around with you.</text><text start="869.534" dur="2.47">The Sony Walkman
really changed that.</text><text start="872.037" dur="2.469">With the small headphones
that the Walkman came with,</text><text start="874.539" dur="2.103">they reduced
the weight by tenfold,</text><text start="876.675" dur="3.27">making it much easier
to carry around
with you and wear.</text><text start="879.978" dur="4.305">Alex: So, the Walkman
didn&amp;#39;t only revolutionize
portable audio,</text><text start="884.316" dur="1.935">it revolutionized
the headphone market.</text><text start="886.284" dur="1.902">Marques:
I love quality audio</text><text start="888.219" dur="1.436">and I take my headphones
with me everywhere,</text><text start="889.688" dur="2.669">so I want to experience
how headphone technology</text><text start="892.39" dur="1.636">has evolved over the years.</text><text start="894.059" dur="3.103">Before the Walkman,
headphones were big and clunky.</text><text start="897.195" dur="2.837">So, Sony solved this problem
by making lightweight,</text><text start="900.065" dur="1.869">breathable headphones</text><text start="901.967" dur="3.036">that ushered in the age
of personal headphones
since then.</text><text start="905.036" dur="1.936">So, we have some of the best
and worst of those with us,</text><text start="907.005" dur="1.368">and we&amp;#39;re going to
give them a spin.</text><text start="908.406" dur="1.536">You can&amp;#39;t hear exactly
what I&amp;#39;m hearing</text><text start="909.975" dur="1.234">since they&amp;#39;re headphones,</text><text start="911.242" dur="1.069">but we&amp;#39;ll give you
the same effect.</text><text start="912.344" dur="2.302">So this is Dope Or Nope.</text><text start="914.679" dur="1.702">Let&amp;#39;s get right into it.</text><text start="916.414" dur="3.137">We&amp;#39;re going to take it back
to before the Walkman--</text><text start="919.584" dur="5.539">the 1971 Professional
Electrostatic Model Float.</text><text start="925.156" dur="1.469">These are huge.</text><text start="926.658" dur="1.435">I don&amp;#39;t know what
this hole is for.</text><text start="928.126" dur="1.335">Like, a ponytail hole?
Who knows?</text><text start="929.494" dur="1.735">These are the only ones
we could find</text><text start="931.262" dur="1.736">from pre-Walkman days.</text><text start="933.031" dur="5.039">Wow. They don&amp;#39;t even
stay over my--</text><text start="938.103" dur="2.502">Um, strong nope.</text><text start="940.638" dur="2.87">Big clunky headphones.</text><text start="943.541" dur="2.47">Moving up to the early 2000s,</text><text start="946.044" dur="1.568">and it&amp;#39;s a neckband style.</text><text start="947.645" dur="1.402">Right behind my neck
like that.</text><text start="949.08" dur="1.369">Let&amp;#39;s listen.</text><text start="950.482" dur="4.938">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="955.453" dur="2.803">These are actually
a little bit more bass heavy.</text><text start="958.289" dur="3.404">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="961.726" dur="2.536">You can now be that guy
walking down the street.</text><text start="964.295" dur="2.17">But the lack of adjustability
kind of kills it,</text><text start="966.498" dur="2.169">so, nope.</text><text start="968.7" dur="2.569">Headphones in general
have branched out</text><text start="971.302" dur="1.436">in a bunch of
different purposes.</text><text start="972.771" dur="2.469">Welcome to 1985.</text><text start="975.273" dur="3.337">We have Sony&amp;#39;s AM/FM
radio headphones.</text><text start="978.643" dur="1.502">Big antenna.</text><text start="980.178" dur="1.435">I have at one point in my life</text><text start="981.646" dur="1.802">seen someone wearing these,</text><text start="983.481" dur="2.803">and it was a neighbor
mowing his lawn.</text><text start="986.317" dur="1.736">So, a new era of portability,</text><text start="988.086" dur="3.137">and dare I say,
truly wireless?</text><text start="991.256" dur="2.402">Dope.</text><text start="993.691" dur="2.437">We have on-ear headphones</text><text start="996.161" dur="2.269">as a sort of expression
of personal style.</text><text start="999.497" dur="4.272">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1003.802" dur="3.57">Oh, they sound horrible.</text><text start="1007.405" dur="2.737">Pretty sure this button
is going to light some stuff up.</text><text start="1010.175" dur="1.969">There it is.</text><text start="1014.112" dur="1.368">There could be a unicorn fan</text><text start="1015.513" dur="2.103">that really wants
headphones like this,</text><text start="1017.649" dur="1.935">and for that person
these are probably dope.</text><text start="1019.617" dur="3.104">But for me,
the foam is not very soft.</text><text start="1022.754" dur="2.77">The sound,
as I mentioned, trash.</text><text start="1025.557" dur="4.771">Despite the glory
of the unicorn horn, nope.</text><text start="1030.361" dur="1.402">The way we hear our music</text><text start="1031.796" dur="1.869">was forever changed
by the Walkman headphones,</text><text start="1033.698" dur="3.471">but how did that impact
the physical medium</text><text start="1037.202" dur="2.002">that contained
the music itself?</text><text start="1039.237" dur="1.268">&lt;i&gt; ♪ Keep on rock,

When the Walkman took off,</text><text start="1041.84" dur="2.536">the cassette tape
also took off.</text><text start="1044.409" dur="3.07">And three years after
the Walkman was released
in the United States,</text><text start="1047.512" dur="4.204">cassette tapes sales outsold
vinyls for the first time.</text><text start="1051.749" dur="2.403">Alex: The introduction
of the blank cassette tape</text><text start="1054.185" dur="2.169">kind of changed everything,
whether you were just</text><text start="1056.387" dur="2.737">grabbing music from your
personal collection</text><text start="1059.157" dur="1.368">or you were stealing it
from the radio.</text><text start="1060.558" dur="1.636">This was a way for you</text><text start="1062.227" dur="2.469">to create your own
music playlist.</text><text start="1064.729" dur="2.97">For the first time,
this gave people real control</text><text start="1067.732" dur="1.802">over what they were
listening to.</text><text start="1069.567" dur="2.87">It wasn&amp;#39;t just dictated by
whatever was sold in stores.</text><text start="1072.47" dur="3.738">The mixtape was a really big
part of growing up.</text><text start="1076.241" dur="1.501">It was a big part
of high school culture.</text><text start="1077.775" dur="1.469">Americus:
There was no such thing</text><text start="1079.277" dur="1.869">as sending your
Spotify list to your pals.</text><text start="1081.179" dur="1.535">You literally were, like,
trading off cassettes.</text><text start="1082.747" dur="1.102">&amp;quot;Hey, I made this
cool mixtape.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1083.882" dur="1.768">&amp;quot;Hey, let me give you mine.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1085.683" dur="1.469">If you had a crush,
you gave them a mixtape.</text><text start="1087.185" dur="1.669">And that was everything
you needed to say</text><text start="1088.887" dur="2.303">but were too scared to say.</text><text start="1092.891" dur="1.501">But the area where the Walkman</text><text start="1094.425" dur="2.77">had the biggest impact
was on exercise.</text><text start="1097.228" dur="4.405">Seth: Running, jogging,
aerobics, Jazzercise,</text><text start="1101.666" dur="1.235">all these things blowing up</text><text start="1102.934" dur="1.635">at the same time
as the Walkman.</text><text start="1104.602" dur="1.769">It&amp;#39;s like this
perfect marriage.</text><text start="1106.404" dur="2.803">Lisa: Sony clearly noticed
that people were using</text><text start="1109.24" dur="2.003">the Walkman for exercise,
so they launched</text><text start="1111.276" dur="2.302">a sport model in the 1980s.</text><text start="1113.611" dur="1.802">Americus:
That was actually kind of
genius to be able to say</text><text start="1115.446" dur="2.303">this is something that is
a natural product market fit,</text><text start="1117.782" dur="2.77">so let&amp;#39;s make something specific
called the Sports Walkman</text><text start="1120.585" dur="2.303">to be able to tap into that.</text><text start="1122.921" dur="3.237">Marques:
The Sony Sports Walkman
was a must-have,</text><text start="1126.191" dur="1.568">due to the rugged design
and durability,</text><text start="1127.792" dur="1.635">but how does it hold up</text><text start="1129.46" dur="2.303">in today&amp;#39;s portable
music standards?</text><text start="1131.796" dur="1.802">To find out, I&amp;#39;m going to
have to run a stress test</text><text start="1133.631" dur="1.969">and see how it functions.</text><text start="1135.633" dur="2.136">As some of you may know,

experience with the Walkman?</text><text start="1177.008" dur="1.735">I had the original Walkman.</text><text start="1178.776" dur="1.936">The Walkman, for me,
it conjures so many memories.</text><text start="1180.745" dur="1.669">That was my first

of this bright yellow?</text><text start="1184.249" dur="1.702">I like it.

it did pretty well.</text><text start="1288.453" dur="1.468">I feel like we proved</text><text start="1289.954" dur="2.636">the original use case
for the Sport Walkman.</text><text start="1292.623" dur="2.303">Running, jogging--
obviously performed great.</text><text start="1294.959" dur="1.936">Yeah, got to give
props to certain aspects
of the Walkman</text><text start="1296.928" dur="1.168">for holding up
better than I thought.</text><text start="1298.129" dur="1.502">Thank you, guys,
for helping me</text><text start="1299.664" dur="1.402">- test out the Walkman.
- Thanks for having us.</text><text start="1301.099" dur="1.702">The Gregory Brothers.</text><text start="1302.834" dur="1.668">So the Sports Walkman
actually held up pretty well,</text><text start="1304.535" dur="1.903">but it was just one example</text><text start="1306.471" dur="3.537">of Sony&amp;#39;s effort to appeal
to people&amp;#39;s unique interests.</text><text start="1310.041" dur="1.935">Lisa: They launched
different colors.</text><text start="1312.009" dur="3.438">They eventually launched a model
that also had AM and FM.</text><text start="1315.48" dur="4.605">Americus:
By giving consumers enough
variation in the product SKUs,</text><text start="1320.118" dur="2.336">that allowed them to say,
&amp;quot;I still feel like</text><text start="1322.487" dur="1.535">this product is personal to me</text><text start="1324.055" dur="2.303">even though everyone has one.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1326.391" dur="1.568">Marques:
Through the mid-1980s</text><text start="1327.992" dur="1.502">and into the early &amp;#39;90s,</text><text start="1329.527" dur="1.969">the Walkman had firmly
established itself</text><text start="1331.529" dur="3.437">as a cultural icon,
often taking on starring roles</text><text start="1334.999" dur="2.002">in classic movies of the era.</text><text start="1337.034" dur="3.104">♪ Leave it all up to me ♪</text><text start="1340.171" dur="2.636">Marques: But by the time
Sony celebrated</text><text start="1342.84" dur="2.136">the Walkman&amp;#39;s
tenth anniversary,</text><text start="1345.009" dur="2.47">a new frontier of technology
was on the horizon.</text><text start="1349.68" dur="1.436">Lisa:
Technology always evolves,</text><text start="1351.149" dur="1.435">and the way we listen to music</text><text start="1352.617" dur="2.035">and get music always changes.</text><text start="1354.685" dur="1.836">Alex:
Once we got towards
the middle of the &amp;#39;90s,</text><text start="1356.554" dur="3.137">the medium of a compact disc
was able to hold more.</text><text start="1359.724" dur="2.369">The sound was a lot more hi-fi.</text><text start="1362.126" dur="2.903">Lisa:
As CD players rose
in popularity,</text><text start="1365.062" dur="3.771">you kind of saw the appeal
of the Walkman start to fade.</text><text start="1368.866" dur="2.27">And what really marked
the end of the Walkman was,</text><text start="1371.169" dur="2.636">of course, the iPod in 2001.</text><text start="1373.838" dur="3.304">Now you can have
your entire music library
in your pocket,</text><text start="1377.175" dur="2.936">not just one or two cassettes
of your choosing.</text><text start="1380.144" dur="2.003">So, it was really
digital music</text><text start="1382.18" dur="2.403">that put the nail
in the coffin for the Walkman.</text><text start="1386.717" dur="2.97">Can you just give me
the legacy of the Walkman?</text><text start="1389.72" dur="2.136">Americus:
It&amp;#39;s the first time
that you saw music</text><text start="1391.889" dur="2.27">really stepping outside
of the background</text><text start="1394.192" dur="2.669">and into the forefront
as a very central</text><text start="1396.894" dur="2.236">means of self-expression
for consumers.</text><text start="1399.163" dur="2.37">The Walkman kind of
created this notion</text><text start="1401.566" dur="2.202">that technology can be
with you all the time.</text><text start="1403.801" dur="2.87">Today, we don&amp;#39;t leave
the house without our phones.</text><text start="1406.704" dur="3.17">We spend hundreds of dollars
on specialized headphones</text><text start="1409.907" dur="2.236">because we love them and want to
wear them all the time.</text><text start="1412.176" dur="2.536">The Walkman was so critical
in all of that.</text><text start="1414.745" dur="3.137">The Walkman is still seen
in pop culture today.</text><text start="1417.915" dur="2.136">I mean, think about
&amp;quot;Guardians Of The Galaxy,&amp;quot;</text><text start="1420.084" dur="3.671">which was a hugely popular movie
in the Marvel franchise.</text><text start="1423.788" dur="1.935">So, it definitely got
a little bit of a revival.</text><text start="1425.756" dur="1.436">Seth:
If you&amp;#39;re listening
to a Walkman,</text><text start="1427.225" dur="1.501">or nowadays an iPhone,</text><text start="1428.759" dur="1.302">while you&amp;#39;re
going about your day,</text><text start="1430.094" dur="2.103">it changes your relationship
with the world.</text><text start="1432.23" dur="1.835">It makes it much easier
to get through the day,</text><text start="1434.098" dur="2.37">whether you&amp;#39;re working a job
or working out.</text><text start="1436.501" dur="2.235">The Walkman allowed us
for the first time</text><text start="1438.769" dur="1.469">to be transported away.</text><text start="1440.271" dur="1.802">It changed everything about</text><text start="1442.106" dur="2.537">how music fits into our lives.</text><text start="1446.244" dur="1.835">Marques:
I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot</text><text start="1448.112" dur="2.002">from my time
with the original Walkman.</text><text start="1450.147" dur="1.936">The biggest takeaway for me</text><text start="1452.116" dur="2.37">is just how much
this thing paved the way</text><text start="1454.519" dur="3.47">for portable audio
as we know it today.</text><text start="1458.022" dur="4.538">From the gears inside,
to the bands, to the buttons--</text><text start="1462.593" dur="2.37">those amazing clicky buttons,</text><text start="1464.996" dur="1.935">they don&amp;#39;t make &amp;#39;em
like they used to.</text><text start="1466.964" dur="2.937">So, thanks to
the Walkman,</text><text start="1469.934" dur="2.67">and thank you for watching.</text><text start="1472.637" dur="1.869">Catch you guys
in the next one. Peace.</text></transcript>
