<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.57" dur="1.47">- All right, so we wanted
to answer the question</text><text start="2.04" dur="0.833">once and for all.</text><text start="2.873" dur="3.397">What is the best smartphone
camera out right now?</text><text start="6.27" dur="1.5">Maybe you think it&amp;#39;s the iPhone.</text><text start="7.77" dur="2.01">Or maybe it&amp;#39;s a Samsung flagship.</text><text start="9.78" dur="1.59">Or maybe it&amp;#39;s one of those Pixels.</text><text start="11.37" dur="2.25">Now, in years past,
we&amp;#39;ve done a blind voting</text><text start="13.62" dur="1.44">using social media polls.</text><text start="15.06" dur="2.64">Which was really fun and
yielded some surprising results.</text><text start="17.7" dur="2.67">But that would still
depend on the match-ups</text><text start="20.37" dur="2.22">that I planted at the very beginning.</text><text start="22.59" dur="2.13">So I specifically put the iPhone</text><text start="24.72" dur="2.19">and the Pixel on opposite
sides of the bracket</text><text start="26.91" dur="3.12">expecting the best ones to
hopefully meet in the finals.</text><text start="30.03" dur="0.833">But they never did.</text><text start="30.863" dur="1.537">And there&amp;#39;s always a bit of human input.</text><text start="32.4" dur="1.59">It&amp;#39;s actually possible I
could have accidentally</text><text start="33.99" dur="2.76">put the second best phone
up against the best phone</text><text start="36.75" dur="1.68">in the first round and it got eliminated.</text><text start="38.43" dur="3.15">So this time we&amp;#39;re gonna solve
all that once and for all.</text><text start="41.58" dur="2.58">Welcome to the &amp;quot;Blind
Smartphone Camera Test:</text><text start="44.16" dur="1.35">Scientific Edition.&amp;quot;</text><text start="45.51" dur="1.32">So here&amp;#39;s the idea.</text><text start="46.83" dur="3.27">We took 16 smartphones that
came out during this year.</text><text start="50.1" dur="2.22">The flagships, your
expected heavy hitters,</text><text start="52.32" dur="2.01">but then also some mid-rangers as well,</text><text start="54.33" dur="1.83">all the way down to the unexpected.</text><text start="56.16" dur="2.4">And then we took the same exact photo</text><text start="58.56" dur="1.2">with each one of them.</text><text start="59.76" dur="0.833">Harder than it sounds</text><text start="60.593" dur="1.507">because you have to hold perfectly still</text><text start="62.1" dur="1.41">for several minutes straight.</text><text start="63.51" dur="1.35">But we actually did this</text><text start="64.86" dur="2.4">for three different types of photos.</text><text start="67.26" dur="3.27">a standard daylight
photo, a low light photo,</text><text start="70.53" dur="1.77">and a portrait mode snap.</text><text start="72.3" dur="1.95">And then we take all these
images, compress them,</text><text start="74.25" dur="3.51">strip them of their EXIF data,
and assign each one a letter.</text><text start="77.76" dur="2.85">Now for maximum statistical confidence,</text><text start="80.61" dur="2.34">we would have to ask you guys to vote</text><text start="82.95" dur="3.6">on every single possible
match-up at least once.</text><text start="86.55" dur="3.78">So A versus B, then A
versus C, then A versus D,</text><text start="90.33" dur="0.833">all the way through.</text><text start="91.163" dur="3.907">And then B versus C, B
versus D. Over and over.</text><text start="95.07" dur="2.31">Sixteen choose two for my stat heads.</text><text start="97.38" dur="2.01">But that&amp;#39;s clearly a bit too much.</text><text start="99.39" dur="1.08">I mean, we wanna be scientific,</text><text start="100.47" dur="3.12">but having you sit there
and vote over 100 times</text><text start="103.59" dur="3">for each category was a bit of a tall ask.</text><text start="106.59" dur="1.86">So instead, we got a
little clever with it.</text><text start="108.45" dur="2.61">And we built a power ranking system,</text><text start="111.06" dur="1.92">actually an ELO rating algorithm,</text><text start="112.98" dur="1.05">which you might have heard of.</text><text start="114.03" dur="3.09">They use this in chess, they
use this in table tennis.</text><text start="117.12" dur="1.98">And basically, in any
video game you&amp;#39;ve played</text><text start="119.1" dur="1.65">where there&amp;#39;s a bunch
of different match-ups</text><text start="120.75" dur="0.833">all happening at once</text><text start="121.583" dur="1.747">and you need to form a ranking of them.</text><text start="123.33" dur="2.07">But this time we&amp;#39;ll be using it to sort of</text><text start="125.4" dur="2.4">form a power ranking
of smartphone cameras.</text><text start="127.8" dur="2.4">So basically, when you hit
enough sanctioned match-ups,</text><text start="130.2" dur="2.01">you&amp;#39;re given a rating based</text><text start="132.21" dur="2.22">on the ratings of your match-ups.</text><text start="134.43" dur="2.1">So you, along with everybody else,</text><text start="136.53" dur="1.83">get shown comparisons at random</text><text start="138.36" dur="2.13">and we have this little
progress bar along the bottom.</text><text start="140.49" dur="2.04">You vote for the better photo each time,</text><text start="142.53" dur="1.2">and then after a little while,</text><text start="143.73" dur="1.17">we have enough information</text><text start="144.9" dur="3.15">to determine your individual, customized,</text><text start="148.05" dur="1.98">statistically significant winner.</text><text start="150.03" dur="1.08">So we built this whole site</text><text start="151.11" dur="1.65">with the ELO rating system in there.</text><text start="152.76" dur="1.47">We loaded up all the photos</text><text start="154.23" dur="2.67">and then we actually tossed
this first into our Discord</text><text start="156.9" dur="2.22">to have some of you beta test this</text><text start="159.12" dur="1.26">before anyone else knew it existed.</text><text start="160.38" dur="1.65">So we could experiment
with the data formatting</text><text start="162.03" dur="2.61">on the out end so we could
make sure it was all organized.</text><text start="164.64" dur="1.23">So actually shout out to Discord</text><text start="165.87" dur="2.19">for sponsoring this
portion of today&amp;#39;s video.</text><text start="168.06" dur="2.91">So with the launch of their new
Server Subscription feature,</text><text start="170.97" dur="2.61">we opened up an exclusive, premium area</text><text start="173.58" dur="2.76">on our Discord server where
members can ask the team,</text><text start="176.34" dur="2.37">including me, you know,
general questions about tech</text><text start="178.71" dur="2.91">or any of the content and
get exclusive insider info</text><text start="181.62" dur="3.09">that you won&amp;#39;t find anywhere
else like this test.</text><text start="184.71" dur="1.26">And also, if you&amp;#39;re wondering,</text><text start="185.97" dur="2.85">Discord does it right with revenue split.</text><text start="188.82" dur="3.72">It&amp;#39;s 90-10, so 90% going to the creator.</text><text start="192.54" dur="2.19">So your subscription directly supports us.</text><text start="194.73" dur="1.98">And if you&amp;#39;re a creator
looking for more information</text><text start="196.71" dur="0.99">on this particular feature</text><text start="197.7" dur="1.62">and adding it to your own Discord,</text><text start="199.32" dur="1.83">definitely check out the link below.</text><text start="201.15" dur="1.95">So anyway, I dropped the site in there,</text><text start="203.1" dur="2.49">a bunch of you got in
there quick and voted,</text><text start="205.59" dur="3.21">and basically, we got the
data back in this text format.</text><text start="208.8" dur="2.25">It looks kind of messy
at first, but actually,</text><text start="211.05" dur="1.8">it&amp;#39;s super helpful and
we can work with this.</text><text start="212.85" dur="1.8">A summary of how many times</text><text start="214.65" dur="2.67">every single match-up got voted on</text><text start="217.32" dur="1.35">and the votes for each side.</text><text start="218.67" dur="2.34">And also since I had a lot of
help with building this site</text><text start="221.01" dur="1.53">and loading up all the pictures,</text><text start="222.54" dur="2.37">even though I know which
phones were involved,</text><text start="224.91" dur="2.76">I don&amp;#39;t know which phones
took which pictures.</text><text start="227.67" dur="2.67">So I could blind test myself.</text><text start="230.34" dur="3.87">And it was every bit as
engaging as I was hoping.</text><text start="234.21" dur="2.34">I could kind of tell some of the phones</text><text start="236.55" dur="1.83">that I think took certain pictures.</text><text start="238.38" dur="2.19">But for the most part, I
would just take a glance,</text><text start="240.57" dur="2.25">and if I was seeing those
two pictures side-by-side</text><text start="242.82" dur="1.68">on like Instagram or Twitter,</text><text start="244.5" dur="1.47">I&amp;#39;m just picking the better one.</text><text start="245.97" dur="2.4">No pixel peeping or thorough inspection.</text><text start="248.37" dur="3.27">It&amp;#39;s just picture on the internet, vote.</text><text start="251.64" dur="3.57">And in the end, my standard
picture winner was G,</text><text start="255.21" dur="2.79">my low light winner was K,</text><text start="258" dur="3.42">and my portrait mode winner was also K.</text><text start="261.42" dur="1.83">So everything looked like it was working.</text><text start="263.25" dur="2.49">The data processing was
working as we wanted.</text><text start="265.74" dur="3.39">So the only thing left
to do was send it live,</text><text start="269.13" dur="2.49">and here we go.</text><text start="271.62" dur="2.43">So as soon as it went public,
you guys jumped right on it.</text><text start="274.05" dur="4.47">It peaked at around
35,000 votes per minute,</text><text start="278.52" dur="4.05">and then ended up totaling
more than 21 million votes</text><text start="282.57" dur="1.11">in about three days.</text><text start="283.68" dur="2.04">There were essentially zero bad actors.</text><text start="285.72" dur="2.76">And now we have a load of data.</text><text start="288.48" dur="1.35">Many of you may have gone through this,</text><text start="289.83" dur="1.23">which means you&amp;#39;ve done the voting</text><text start="291.06" dur="1.5">and now you have your letter.</text><text start="292.56" dur="2.73">Which means it&amp;#39;s time to
reveal all of the smartphones</text><text start="295.29" dur="2.133">that were involved in this test.</text><text start="298.38" dur="2.01">And here you go, A through P.</text><text start="300.39" dur="2.94">That&amp;#39;s all 16 phones right
there in their order.</text><text start="303.33" dur="2.34">Which means the winner when
I blind took the test myself</text><text start="305.67" dur="3.84">for my standard photo was the Pixel 6A.</text><text start="309.51" dur="3.78">My winner for portrait mode and night mode</text><text start="313.29" dur="0.96">was the Pixel 7.</text><text start="314.25" dur="2.7">But what were the overall
winners according to statistics,</text><text start="316.95" dur="3.96">over the 20 plus million
votes according to science?</text><text start="320.91" dur="1.95">I don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s any
other collection of data</text><text start="322.86" dur="1.23">like this anywhere on the internet.</text><text start="324.09" dur="1.35">So this is super cool to get into.</text><text start="325.44" dur="2.04">So let&amp;#39;s dig into it.</text><text start="327.48" dur="2.64">So first of all, overall winner</text><text start="330.12" dur="2.4">so with the highest average ELO rating</text><text start="332.52" dur="2.61">across all three categories.</text><text start="335.13" dur="4.23">In third place is the Asus Zenfone 9.</text><text start="339.36" dur="3.54">In second place is the Pixel 7 Pro.</text><text start="342.9" dur="3.42">And first place is the Pixel 6A,</text><text start="346.32" dur="3.24">the people&amp;#39;s choice camera of 2022.</text><text start="349.56" dur="2.58">But there is a lot of
fascinating information</text><text start="352.14" dur="0.833">to unpack here.</text><text start="352.973" dur="2.347">So first of all, doing
well in one category</text><text start="355.32" dur="1.98">did not necessarily guarantee doing well</text><text start="357.3" dur="2.34">across any of the other categories, right?</text><text start="359.64" dur="3.3">So the Pixel 7 Pro came in second, fourth,</text><text start="362.94" dur="2.16">and first in the three categories.</text><text start="365.1" dur="4.47">The Pixel 6A came in
third, second, and second.</text><text start="369.57" dur="2.25">But the Oppo Find X5 Pro actually came</text><text start="371.82" dur="3.18">in first for standard,
then third for low light,</text><text start="375" dur="1.92">and 15th for portrait mode.</text><text start="376.92" dur="2.28">This basically means that, if you wanted,</text><text start="379.2" dur="4.14">you could argue for the
importance of the standard photo</text><text start="383.34" dur="2.34">over the low light or
the portrait mode photos.</text><text start="385.68" dur="2.46">So let&amp;#39;s say the standard
photo is like three times</text><text start="388.14" dur="2.55">as important to most people
as the other two categories,</text><text start="390.69" dur="1.47">which feels about right.</text><text start="392.16" dur="3.03">With that weighted importance
on standard photos,</text><text start="395.19" dur="3.78">then the Oppo Find X5 Pro
becomes the overall winner</text><text start="398.97" dur="0.833">which is interesting.</text><text start="399.803" dur="0.833">And in case you&amp;#39;re wondering</text><text start="400.636" dur="0.974">where the iPhone was in all this,</text><text start="401.61" dur="3.45">the iPhone 14 Pro tested in sixth place,</text><text start="405.06" dur="2.16">10th place, and fifth place.</text><text start="407.22" dur="1.8">But in natural curiosity, for me anyway,</text><text start="409.02" dur="3.18">was to ask what were the biggest losers.</text><text start="412.2" dur="2.76">Which ones got absolutely
destroyed the most</text><text start="414.96" dur="1.47">in this test?</text><text start="416.43" dur="3.63">And your undisputed
winners of losing the most</text><text start="420.06" dur="5">is the Sony Xperia 1 IV
and the Moto Edge 30 Ultra.</text><text start="426.09" dur="2.22">These phones performed
terribly in these tests.</text><text start="428.31" dur="2.46">So the Sony, despite
its world-class sensor</text><text start="430.77" dur="1.8">and extremely advanced apps,</text><text start="432.57" dur="2.13">went in full auto, like
the rest of these phones,</text><text start="434.7" dur="1.23">did not produce good pictures</text><text start="435.93" dur="2.19">and ended up with the
lowest average ELO rating</text><text start="438.12" dur="1.77">across all three categories.</text><text start="439.89" dur="2.1">And then the Moto Edge 30 Ultra actually</text><text start="441.99" dur="2.01">had the most overall losses.</text><text start="444" dur="1.8">It took a bizarre sequence of photos,</text><text start="445.8" dur="2.61">including an extremely
dark standard light photo</text><text start="448.41" dur="2.79">and an incredibly over
sharpened low light photo,</text><text start="451.2" dur="3.6">that it&amp;#39;s the only one to
have 2 million total votes</text><text start="454.8" dur="0.833">against it.</text><text start="455.633" dur="2.077">Now here&amp;#39;s another interesting thought.</text><text start="457.71" dur="1.8">Votes per dollar.</text><text start="459.51" dur="2.82">If we wanted to sort by
bang for the buck basically</text><text start="462.33" dur="4.2">which ones, if we account for
the launch price, the MSRP,</text><text start="466.53" dur="3.54">which one was performing the
best relative to its price?</text><text start="470.07" dur="3.45">And the two winners for
votes per dollar by far</text><text start="473.52" dur="1.35">are the Pixel 6A.</text><text start="474.87" dur="3.18">No surprise. Over 4,200 votes per dollar.</text><text start="478.05" dur="3.63">And the Realme 10 Pro+
also sneaks in there,</text><text start="481.68" dur="3.06">the only other phone up
over 4,000 votes per dollar.</text><text start="484.74" dur="2.64">Sneaky good camera phone for $379.</text><text start="487.38" dur="4.32">And then the obvious losers,
again, are the $900 Moto Edge</text><text start="491.7" dur="3.57">and the $1,600 Sony Xperia 1 IV.</text><text start="495.27" dur="1.08">Also I just had to.</text><text start="496.35" dur="1.23">I had to look through the text files</text><text start="497.58" dur="1.5">and find the biggest dunk.</text><text start="499.08" dur="2.88">Just the biggest overall
match-up discrepancy</text><text start="501.96" dur="2.16">between two phones in any category.</text><text start="504.12" dur="0.9">And I found it.</text><text start="505.02" dur="2.82">That would be portrait mode Pixel 7 Pro</text><text start="507.84" dur="2.01">versus Sony Xperia 1 IV</text><text start="509.85" dur="4.14">with the Pixel winning
98% of the votes here.</text><text start="513.99" dur="3.81">So to the 1,523 of you that
voted for the Sony here,</text><text start="517.8" dur="2.01">not sure what you saw that
the rest of us didn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="519.81" dur="2.25">But overall, just more
than seeing which ones</text><text start="522.06" dur="4.38">got the most votes is
seeing why certain phones</text><text start="526.44" dur="2.4">and certain pictures got the most votes.</text><text start="528.84" dur="1.23">And the best way to do that</text><text start="530.07" dur="2.61">was actually just
putting all of the photos</text><text start="532.68" dur="4.17">in order side-by-side in order
of how many votes they got.</text><text start="536.85" dur="1.38">And that&amp;#39;s how we started to see</text><text start="538.23" dur="1.41">some really interesting patterns.</text><text start="539.64" dur="2.34">So like for example, last
time in the head-to-head,</text><text start="541.98" dur="3.78">we kind of established that
in a case of A versus B,</text><text start="545.76" dur="2.16">if one vote is a little
brighter than the other,</text><text start="547.92" dur="1.62">it&amp;#39;ll probably win.</text><text start="549.54" dur="1.02">But how far can that go?</text><text start="550.56" dur="2.4">Is there a such thing as
too bright in this case?</text><text start="552.96" dur="1.89">And it turned out, yes.</text><text start="554.85" dur="3.09">This is all the standard
mode photos in order.</text><text start="557.94" dur="2.19">And yes, the three darkest photos</text><text start="560.13" dur="1.53">are the three biggest losers.</text><text start="561.66" dur="3.33">Hands down, they crushed
any shadow detail in my hair</text><text start="564.99" dur="2.04">and the extremely comfortable
sweater I&amp;#39;m wearing</text><text start="567.03" dur="1.95">on shop.mkbhd.com.</text><text start="568.98" dur="2.28">But right above that</text><text start="571.26" dur="2.73">is three of the absolute brightest photos.</text><text start="573.99" dur="2.7">Like these were just
overexposed straight up.</text><text start="576.69" dur="2.01">Matter of fact, it looks like
we kind of got this order</text><text start="578.7" dur="4.83">of great photos, then too
bright, then too dark.</text><text start="583.53" dur="1.8">So it shows me that good exposure wins.</text><text start="585.33" dur="1.47">But if you&amp;#39;re gonna miss,</text><text start="586.8" dur="2.1">then yeah, people would
rather have it be too bright</text><text start="588.9" dur="0.833">than too dark.</text><text start="589.733" dur="1.747">With night mode altogether and in order,</text><text start="591.48" dur="2.4">you can kind of see a
bit of the same thing.</text><text start="593.88" dur="3.03">So the most neutral, correct
exposures generally won</text><text start="596.91" dur="1.08">if they were sharp.</text><text start="597.99" dur="2.25">This time there&amp;#39;s about
four good exposures.</text><text start="600.24" dur="5">Vivo X80 Pro, Pixel 6A, Oppo
Find X5 Pro, and Pixel 7 Pro.</text><text start="605.94" dur="2.01">Then there&amp;#39;s the two brights,</text><text start="607.95" dur="3.12">which people mostly
preferred over the two darks.</text><text start="611.07" dur="2.31">Also, there were some
seriously wild things happening</text><text start="613.38" dur="1.83">with some of these photos in low light.</text><text start="615.21" dur="2.46">The Vivo, I mean, it absolutely nailed it.</text><text start="617.67" dur="2.49">It&amp;#39;s clearly the low light king.</text><text start="620.16" dur="3.39">The S22 ultra interestingly
came in fifth place</text><text start="623.55" dur="4.08">even when completely missing
focus on my stationary face</text><text start="627.63" dur="2.34">and hitting the background
for some reason.</text><text start="629.97" dur="3.45">The iPhone 14 Pro did an
enormous amount of HDR</text><text start="633.42" dur="2.88">that had me looking kind
of green like a zombie,</text><text start="636.3" dur="2.19">but it still came in 11th place here.</text><text start="638.49" dur="1.53">The Moto Edge Plus, as I mentioned,</text><text start="640.02" dur="2.7">kicked out maybe the
most over sharpened photo</text><text start="642.72" dur="1.35">the world has ever seen.</text><text start="644.07" dur="3.78">And then in dead last is the iPhone SE,</text><text start="647.85" dur="4.23">the only phone in this test
that does not have night mode.</text><text start="652.08" dur="2.61">And the sad thing is
like it does have OIS,</text><text start="654.69" dur="1.89">it does have a decent sensor,</text><text start="656.58" dur="2.04">and it does have a new processor.</text><text start="658.62" dur="1.05">But Apple just feels the need</text><text start="659.67" dur="1.95">to protect their more expensive phones</text><text start="661.62" dur="1.5">with more premium features.</text><text start="663.12" dur="2.46">So they didn&amp;#39;t give the SE night mode,</text><text start="665.58" dur="2.01">and it suffered big time here.</text><text start="667.59" dur="3.42">Then in portrait mode, we have
the most variety of them all</text><text start="671.01" dur="1.68">because not only are we judging things</text><text start="672.69" dur="1.44">that we normally would about a photo</text><text start="674.13" dur="2.64">like sharpness, color exposure, et cetera,</text><text start="676.77" dur="3.12">but we are also now adding cutout quality</text><text start="679.89" dur="3.06">and artificially blurred
background quality.</text><text start="682.95" dur="3.9">And every phone uses a
slightly different focal length</text><text start="686.85" dur="1.65">for their portrait mode by default.</text><text start="688.5" dur="3.18">Some of them do a 2x portrait
mode, some of them 2.5,</text><text start="691.68" dur="3.33">some of them 3x, some of them even do 1x.</text><text start="695.01" dur="2.07">But combining all of these factors,</text><text start="697.08" dur="3.84">the Pixel 7 Pro, absolutely
dominated portrait mode.</text><text start="700.92" dur="2.76">This was the runaway winner
here in this category.</text><text start="703.68" dur="2.28">Great cutout, great exposure,</text><text start="705.96" dur="2.49">great colors and a nice soft background.</text><text start="708.45" dur="1.29">It nailed it, but guess what?</text><text start="709.74" dur="2.64">The Pixel 6A was in second</text><text start="712.38" dur="3.09">and the Realme 10 Pro+
snuck in there in third.</text><text start="715.47" dur="3.33">Right above what I
consider the best cutout</text><text start="718.8" dur="1.59">of the entire competition,</text><text start="720.39" dur="3.3">which came from this Galaxy S22 Ultra.</text><text start="723.69" dur="3.24">I think it&amp;#39;s pretty close to
perfect at edge detection here.</text><text start="726.93" dur="2.34">Pretty similar to the Zenfone 9&amp;#39;s cutout,</text><text start="729.27" dur="1.77">but a better overall photo.</text><text start="731.04" dur="2.43">So it got fourth place instead of seventh.</text><text start="733.47" dur="1.92">I was also curious if there
would be a correlation</text><text start="735.39" dur="2.07">between how many votes a phone got</text><text start="737.46" dur="1.62">and whether or not they used more</text><text start="739.08" dur="1.8">of a telephoto focal length.</text><text start="740.88" dur="1.95">Just because maybe it
would feel more natural</text><text start="742.83" dur="2.79">having a blurred
background if you&amp;#39;re at 3x.</text><text start="745.62" dur="1.47">But when we lined it all up,</text><text start="747.09" dur="2.76">there was almost no trend line
at all and no correlation.</text><text start="749.85" dur="1.23">So that was interesting.</text><text start="751.08" dur="2.7">Really, the only other
definite thing I noticed</text><text start="753.78" dur="1.59">about portrait mode photos</text><text start="755.37" dur="4.29">is that the three worst photos
that got the fewest votes</text><text start="759.66" dur="4.11">by far were also by far
the brightest photos.</text><text start="763.77" dur="3.12">So see, it turns out you
can overdo the brightness.</text><text start="766.89" dur="4.14">And that, I think that is basically it.</text><text start="771.03" dur="2.91">So summary time, just from
all the data that we have.</text><text start="773.94" dur="1.02">Things that we learned.</text><text start="774.96" dur="2.37">Number one is that being really good</text><text start="777.33" dur="2.73">in one of these categories
did not necessarily guarantee</text><text start="780.06" dur="1.38">being good at the others.</text><text start="781.44" dur="2.25">That&amp;#39;s clearly reflected in the data.</text><text start="783.69" dur="5">Two, is that Pixel 6A
and the Realme 10 Pro+</text><text start="788.85" dur="1.95">turned out to be the
best bang for the buck</text><text start="790.8" dur="2.52">as far as a smartphone
camera from the phones</text><text start="793.32" dur="1.59">that came out in 2022.</text><text start="794.91" dur="2.46">And the Pixel 6A being the overall winner</text><text start="797.37" dur="3.9">actually matches with it
winning our bracket style</text><text start="801.27" dur="3.33">social media polling
blind test from last year,</text><text start="804.6" dur="1.62">which the Pixel 5A won.</text><text start="806.22" dur="1.23">And last but not least,</text><text start="807.45" dur="2.79">yeah, brighter photos do typically win,</text><text start="810.24" dur="2.58">but you can in fact be too bright.</text><text start="812.82" dur="3.39">So I think this mission was
a success. We learned a lot.</text><text start="816.21" dur="1.89">I&amp;#39;ll say congrats to the Pixel 6A</text><text start="818.1" dur="2.67">on the People&amp;#39;s Choice Award, so to speak.</text><text start="820.77" dur="0.833">And you know what?</text><text start="821.603" dur="3.727">We&amp;#39;re gonna leave up the
voting website till, let&amp;#39;s say,</text><text start="825.33" dur="1.56">through the end of this year.</text><text start="826.89" dur="1.68">Till the end of January how about.</text><text start="828.57" dur="2.43">So January 31st is the
last day you&amp;#39;ll be able</text><text start="831" dur="4.02">to go to vote.mkbhd.com
and blind test yourself.</text><text start="835.02" dur="1.71">And I think we&amp;#39;ll replace the letters now</text><text start="836.73" dur="1.14">with the actual names of the phones</text><text start="837.87" dur="1.5">now that it&amp;#39;s been revealed.</text><text start="839.37" dur="1.5">But we don&amp;#39;t wanna have to pay</text><text start="840.87" dur="2.25">for all this terabytes of
data processing forever.</text><text start="843.12" dur="0.96">So that&amp;#39;s your deadline.</text><text start="844.08" dur="1.17">So thanks to y&amp;#39;all on the Discord</text><text start="845.25" dur="1.92">for helping us beta test this thing.</text><text start="847.17" dur="2.46">Thanks to Zach for
helping us build this site</text><text start="849.63" dur="3.03">and implement the ELO
style power ranking system.</text><text start="852.66" dur="3.12">And thanks to you for watching.</text><text start="855.78" dur="2.56">Catch you guys to the next one. Peace.</text><text start="858.34" dur="2.417">(soft music)</text></transcript>
