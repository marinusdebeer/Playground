dropped a Twitter thread,</text><text start="5.31" dur="1.5">yes, I still call it Twitter,</text><text start="6.81" dur="2.07">and I severely underestimated</text><text start="8.88" dur="1.77">how many of you guys
would be interested in it.</text><text start="10.65" dur="1.86">But then a lot of the conversation</text><text start="12.51" dur="1.47">that it drove was really interesting,</text><text start="13.98" dur="2.49">and a lot of discussions that
happened afterward were fun</text><text start="16.47" dur="0.833">to participate in,</text><text start="17.303" dur="2.917">so I figured I would drop
even more of the footage here.</text><text start="20.22" dur="3">So I&amp;#39;m back with more of my footage</text><text start="23.22" dur="2.13">and clips from my visit</text><text start="25.35" dur="3.78">to Apple&amp;#39;s secret iPhone
durability testing labs.</text><text start="29.13" dur="0.93">So if you ever wondered</text><text start="30.06" dur="2.82">how an iPhone gets
water resistance tested,</text><text start="32.88" dur="2.91">or drop tested, or shaken like crazy</text><text start="35.79" dur="1.68">before it gets announced on stage,</text><text start="37.47" dur="3.15">these are the labs where
all of that happens.</text><text start="40.62" dur="1.65">And then they have to connect the dots</text><text start="42.27" dur="1.83">between their test results</text><text start="44.1" dur="3.3">and how they actually build
phones, which is fascinating.</text><text start="47.4" dur="1.68">So the first thing that I saw was</text><text start="49.08" dur="1.83">the water resistance testing.</text><text start="50.91" dur="1.05">So I think a lot of us kind of take</text><text start="51.96" dur="2.22">for granted at this point
most high-end smartphones,</text><text start="54.18" dur="3.84">most flagships have IP68 ratings.</text><text start="58.02" dur="1.5">But a lot of people don&amp;#39;t
actually think about it,</text><text start="59.52" dur="0.99">that that is a code,</text><text start="60.51" dur="2.64">where IP stands for ingress protection,</text><text start="63.15" dur="2.13">and then the first number is for solids,</text><text start="65.28" dur="2.34">and then the second number is for liquids.</text><text start="67.62" dur="2.1">And so each of these numbers
gets higher and higher</text><text start="69.72" dur="2.28">as it&amp;#39;s more protected against ingress.</text><text start="72" dur="2.49">So some, like, earbuds or
headphones, for example,</text><text start="74.49" dur="2.22">you might see they are IPX4 rated.</text><text start="76.71" dur="2.4">That just means they&amp;#39;re
not protected from dust,</text><text start="79.11" dur="3.42">but from water, they can
withstand some light splashes</text><text start="82.53" dur="1.29">from any direction.</text><text start="83.82" dur="1.08">So sweat. Great.</text><text start="84.9" dur="1.44">So the first iPhones all the way up</text><text start="86.34" dur="4.02">to the iPhone 6s were not
water resistant at all,</text><text start="90.36" dur="1.5">at least not rated to be,</text><text start="91.86" dur="1.65">but then the first water-resistant iPhone,</text><text start="93.51" dur="3.69">iPhone 7, was IP67 water resistant.</text><text start="97.2" dur="3.33">And then now we see everything being IP68,</text><text start="100.53" dur="1.77">meaning it can literally be underwater</text><text start="102.3" dur="1.29">for an extended period of time.</text><text start="103.59" dur="1.29">And so this is what it looks like</text><text start="104.88" dur="2.34">to actually test that stuff.</text><text start="107.22" dur="2.37">There&amp;#39;s literally specialty equipment just</text><text start="109.59" dur="3.57">to torture phones with water
and make sure they can survive.</text><text start="113.16" dur="2.1">So lots of companies have these things,</text><text start="115.26" dur="1.56">but it was cool to see it in person.</text><text start="116.82" dur="3.48">So the lowest level of this
test is basically a drip ceiling</text><text start="120.3" dur="1.83">to simulate rain and splashing.</text><text start="122.13" dur="1.83">So there&amp;#39;s no real water pressure here.</text><text start="123.96" dur="3.87">But a pass is good for IPX4 on this test.</text><text start="127.83" dur="2.31">But then to simulate some water pressure,</text><text start="130.14" dur="3.24">they have these jets that
rotate around the device</text><text start="133.38" dur="2.49">and spray it with water from all angles.</text><text start="135.87" dur="2.4">Into the speakers, into the earpiece,</text><text start="138.27" dur="2.31">into the ports, everything.</text><text start="140.58" dur="2.55">And if it&amp;#39;s able to pass this test,</text><text start="143.13" dur="1.56">that&amp;#39;s good for IPX5.</text><text start="144.69" dur="2.79">It seems so simple, but it&amp;#39;s
also pretty cool to see.</text><text start="147.48" dur="2.04">I&amp;#39;ve never actually watched this happen.</text><text start="149.52" dur="3.09">To turn it up to 11, they
just put the phone on one end</text><text start="152.61" dur="2.85">and stick basically a literal
fire hose on the other end</text><text start="155.46" dur="3.06">and just blast the phone
with high-pressure water.</text><text start="158.52" dur="0.96">Kind of looks insane,</text><text start="159.48" dur="1.62">but if we want our modern smartphones</text><text start="161.1" dur="2.43">to be able to get splashed
from any angle many times</text><text start="163.53" dur="1.89">over its lifetime and survive,</text><text start="165.42" dur="1.71">then it has to survive this.</text><text start="167.13" dur="2.43">And then it earns its IPX6 rating.</text><text start="169.56" dur="2.79">But then, finally, for IPX7 and IPX8,</text><text start="172.35" dur="1.08">that&amp;#39;s full submersion.</text><text start="173.43" dur="2.25">So they have some lockable sealed tanks.</text><text start="175.68" dur="1.71">But some of you may already know that IPX8</text><text start="177.39" dur="2.4">is supposed to be under
deep water for long time.</text><text start="179.79" dur="2.67">So they actually have
this pressurized tank</text><text start="182.46" dur="2.1">where they can turn up the pressure inside</text><text start="184.56" dur="2.25">to simulate different water depths</text><text start="186.81" dur="2.37">and leave phones in there
as long as they want.</text><text start="189.18" dur="1.29">So now, ideally, today,</text><text start="190.47" dur="3.42">if you drop your phone in the
toilet, or spill water on it,</text><text start="193.89" dur="2.22">or drop it in a lake, whatever,</text><text start="196.11" dur="2.85">for as long as it&amp;#39;s down
there, it should survive.</text><text start="198.96" dur="1.53">Which, again, we kind
of take it for granted,</text><text start="200.49" dur="1.74">but that&amp;#39;s all the seals and the gaskets</text><text start="202.23" dur="2.04">and all the adhesives and
things that go into getting it</text><text start="204.27" dur="2.43">to pass those tests are what get it</text><text start="206.7" dur="1.5">to pass the real-world tests.</text><text start="208.2" dur="2.7">Now, there is an entire
separate type of testing</text><text start="210.9" dur="2.19">that you might have
already seen on YouTube.</text><text start="213.09" dur="1.98">That is, drop testing.</text><text start="215.07" dur="1.59">And it turns out Apple has been doing</text><text start="216.66" dur="3.72">their own internal drop
testing for years now.</text><text start="220.38" dur="1.26">So it turns out, in the same building,</text><text start="221.64" dur="3.78">Apple&amp;#39;s set up this full on
industrial robot by Epson</text><text start="225.42" dur="3.24">that they&amp;#39;ve programmed
to be a drop test robot.</text><text start="228.66" dur="0.84">And then they&amp;#39;ve set it up</text><text start="229.5" dur="1.77">in front of these ultrabright lights</text><text start="231.27" dur="2.28">and super-high-speed
Phantom cameras pointed</text><text start="233.55" dur="3.51">at the exact spot on the ground
where the phone will land.</text><text start="237.06" dur="2.7">So the idea here is they
can program the robot</text><text start="239.76" dur="3.543">to pick up the phone and
drop it onto any surface.</text><text start="246.411" dur="2.589">(robot whirring)</text><text start="249" dur="3.03">And then they can have it
repeat that exact motion</text><text start="252.03" dur="3.42">and that exact same drop
on the exact same angle</text><text start="255.45" dur="2.76">over and over again, but
with different surfaces,</text><text start="258.21" dur="1.56">and they can A/B test them</text><text start="259.77" dur="2.16">and take a look at exactly what happened.</text><text start="261.93" dur="1.35">And then those of you
who are camera nerds,</text><text start="263.28" dur="2.73">you already know these Phantom
cameras are pretty serious.</text><text start="266.01" dur="1.56">I don&amp;#39;t remember the exact frame rate</text><text start="267.57" dur="1.08">they told me they were shooting at,</text><text start="268.65" dur="2.46">but it&amp;#39;s pretty incredible.</text><text start="271.11" dur="2.67">You can actually see the titanium</text><text start="273.78" dur="2.61">on this iPhone 15 Pro wobble</text><text start="276.39" dur="2.52">on its first impact with the ground.</text><text start="278.91" dur="1.89">And its second impact too.</text><text start="280.8" dur="2.4">So yeah, they had all kinds
of different materials</text><text start="283.2" dur="2.94">to do drop tests, from
granite countertops to marble,</text><text start="286.14" dur="3.12">to corkboard and wood, et cetera.</text><text start="289.26" dur="1.41">They even had this massive block</text><text start="290.67" dur="1.35">of asphalt just sitting there,</text><text start="292.02" dur="3.27">just waiting to see how the
iPhone reacts to being dropped</text><text start="295.29" dur="1.38">in the streets, you know?</text><text start="296.67" dur="1.59">But this is a fascinating setup.</text><text start="298.26" dur="1.62">Now, of course, the fact is,</text><text start="299.88" dur="2.19">most phones still just break immediately</text><text start="302.07" dur="1.23">when you drop them on the ground.</text><text start="303.3" dur="2.61">So I kind of wonder how much of this data</text><text start="305.91" dur="1.53">is actually getting translated</text><text start="307.44" dur="2.58">into real changes of phone design.</text><text start="310.02" dur="1.98">But it&amp;#39;s still cool that I
got to see all this stuff.</text><text start="312" dur="1.38">And then the hardest one to capture,</text><text start="313.38" dur="4.053">for me, anyway, is the shaking tests.</text><text start="318.3" dur="2.31">Yeah, that&amp;#39;s exactly what it
sounds like. Shaking tests.</text><text start="320.61" dur="1.68">Apple has rooms full of machines</text><text start="322.29" dur="3.99">that are literally trays of
devices strapped to a surface</text><text start="326.28" dur="2.7">that&amp;#39;s being shaken thousands of times</text><text start="328.98" dur="1.92">at a specific frequency.</text><text start="330.9" dur="1.26">It&amp;#39;s actually kind of hard to record,</text><text start="332.16" dur="2.25">because if my shutter speed
is at the right number,</text><text start="334.41" dur="2.46">it doesn&amp;#39;t even really look
like anything&amp;#39;s moving.</text><text start="336.87" dur="2.4">Kind of like how car wheels
don&amp;#39;t look like they&amp;#39;re spinning</text><text start="339.27" dur="1.47">if you have the right camera settings.</text><text start="340.74" dur="2.58">But I did get a few clips
where like I put my hand on it,</text><text start="343.32" dur="1.92">and you can see it&amp;#39;s moving a lot.</text><text start="345.24" dur="3.39">They&amp;#39;re using this machine to
try to simulate years of wear</text><text start="348.63" dur="2.01">and tear out in the real world.</text><text start="350.64" dur="2.31">Apparently, they can
program in the frequency</text><text start="352.95" dur="3.24">of a certain motorcycle
engine, or a car engine,</text><text start="356.19" dur="2.76">or subway car, or whatever
constant vibration</text><text start="358.95" dur="1.35">that they just want to check up on,</text><text start="360.3" dur="2.22">to make sure everything
holds up to exposure</text><text start="362.52" dur="1.89">to it over a very long time.</text><text start="364.41" dur="1.35">But I really think the
most fascinating thing</text><text start="365.76" dur="2.25">about all this testing is they are trying,</text><text start="368.01" dur="1.17">before the phone even comes out,</text><text start="369.18" dur="2.67">they&amp;#39;re trying to simulate
years of wear and tear</text><text start="371.85" dur="2.073">in the real world, with real customers,</text><text start="374.79" dur="3.09">in a small room under the
basement of Apple Park,</text><text start="377.88" dur="1.62">with, like, the machines
that they&amp;#39;ve designed.</text><text start="379.5" dur="2.52">It&amp;#39;s a fascinating connection
they&amp;#39;ve gotta make.</text><text start="382.02" dur="1.23">And I spoke to John Ternus,</text><text start="383.25" dur="2.7">who&amp;#39;s the head of hardware
engineering at Apple,</text><text start="385.95" dur="2.82">about this process, and
he mentioned, apparently,</text><text start="388.77" dur="4.71">they go through sometimes 10,000 iPhones,</text><text start="393.48" dur="3.03">prototypes, before they
actually ship a final phone,</text><text start="396.51" dur="2.37">with all this durability testing.</text><text start="398.88" dur="0.9">Which sounds crazy.</text><text start="399.78" dur="2.19">I don&amp;#39;t know what number I
thought it was in my head,</text><text start="401.97" dur="3.75">but it seems insane that they&amp;#39;ll
make 10,000 phones to break</text><text start="405.72" dur="0.96">before they ship one.</text><text start="406.68" dur="1.95">And actually, while I had John there,</text><text start="408.63" dur="2.13">I felt like this was a
unique opportunity to ask,</text><text start="410.76" dur="2.61">&amp;#39;cause I&amp;#39;ve never really heard people</text><text start="413.37" dur="3.78">from Apple actually speak
out about the durability,</text><text start="417.15" dur="2.73">but also the repairability of the iPhone.</text><text start="419.88" dur="3.18">Like, we all know Apple&amp;#39;s
reputation for repairability:</text><text start="423.06" dur="0.833">not great.</text><text start="423.893" dur="3.367">Like, the iPhone&amp;#39;s notoriously
very difficult to repair.</text><text start="427.26" dur="1.35">But also, now it&amp;#39;s a little clearer</text><text start="428.61" dur="2.07">because the more I&amp;#39;ve thought about it,</text><text start="430.68" dur="1.29">the more it feels like, I mean,</text><text start="431.97" dur="2.49">Apple&amp;#39;s just shown me a
ton of durability labs,</text><text start="434.46" dur="3.33">and durability feels like it&amp;#39;s directly</text><text start="437.79" dur="2.4">at odds with repairability.</text><text start="440.19" dur="3.27">Like, it actually feels like
it&amp;#39;s basically a sliding scale,</text><text start="443.46" dur="3.39">with durability on one side
and repairability on the other.</text><text start="446.85" dur="3.12">And the more durable you
want to make your thing,</text><text start="449.97" dur="2.94">the less repairable
you&amp;#39;re making your thing.</text><text start="452.91" dur="2.31">And all these decisions
that go into making</text><text start="455.22" dur="1.95">and designing a product
are kind of pushing it</text><text start="457.17" dur="1.92">back and forth along this scale.</text><text start="459.09" dur="1.38">So take a listen to this.</text><text start="460.47" dur="1.26">- But sometimes, for me,</text><text start="461.73" dur="2.04">I find it helpful to kind
of think about the bookends.</text><text start="463.77" dur="2.76">Like, if you imagine a product
that never fails, right,</text><text start="466.53" dur="1.59">that just doesn&amp;#39;t fail.</text><text start="468.12" dur="0.833">And on the other end,</text><text start="468.953" dur="2.287">a product that maybe isn&amp;#39;t very reliable,</text><text start="471.24" dur="1.71">but is super easy to repair.</text><text start="472.95" dur="0.833">- Right.</text><text start="473.783" dur="1.027">- A product that never fails</text><text start="474.81" dur="1.77">is obviously better for the customer.</text><text start="476.58" dur="1.17">It&amp;#39;s better for the environment.</text><text start="477.75" dur="1.35">- Okay, it&amp;#39;s interesting
you put it that way,</text><text start="479.1" dur="2.12">&amp;#39;cause on one end you have
the product that never fails.</text><text start="481.22" dur="1.39">On the other hand, you have the product</text><text start="482.61" dur="3.66">that can be replaced infinitely,
but it&amp;#39;s not as reliable.</text><text start="486.27" dur="0.833">- Yep.</text><text start="487.103" dur="2.227">- That downside of being
not as reliable comes</text><text start="489.33" dur="1.68">from being infinitely repairable.</text><text start="491.01" dur="0.84">But I think someone would argue</text><text start="491.85" dur="3.48">that the downside of being
really hard to repair comes</text><text start="495.33" dur="2.493">from being almost infinitely durable.</text><text start="499.11" dur="3.39">- Sure, but they&amp;#39;re not
always mutually exclusive.</text><text start="502.5" dur="1.23">Like, those are kind of the bookends.</text><text start="503.73" dur="2.97">So let me give you, like,
a couple of examples.</text><text start="506.7" dur="2.97">I think a battery on an iPhone</text><text start="509.67" dur="1.26">as being an important one.</text><text start="510.93" dur="2.31">On an iPhone, on any phone,
a battery is something,</text><text start="513.24" dur="1.95">if you want to extend
the life of the product,</text><text start="515.19" dur="2.31">that&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s gonna
need to be replaced, right?</text><text start="517.5" dur="1.473">Batteries wear out.</text><text start="520.41" dur="1.71">As we&amp;#39;ve been making
iPhones for a long time,</text><text start="522.12" dur="2.61">in the early days, one
of the most common types</text><text start="524.73" dur="2.22">of failures was water ingress, right?</text><text start="526.95" dur="2.46">Where you drop it in a pool,</text><text start="529.41" dur="2.01">or you, you know, spill your drink on it,</text><text start="531.42" dur="0.99">and the unit fails.</text><text start="532.41" dur="2.88">And so we&amp;#39;ve been making
strides over all those years</text><text start="535.29" dur="1.74">to get better and better and better</text><text start="537.03" dur="2.04">in terms of minimizing those failures.</text><text start="539.07" dur="1.86">And I don&amp;#39;t know how
many years it&amp;#39;s been now,</text><text start="540.93" dur="1.8">but we got to a point of IP68,</text><text start="542.73" dur="2.37">which is kind of a
rating for water ingress,</text><text start="545.1" dur="1.47">which is really impressive.</text><text start="546.57" dur="1.62">And I think you get to
see some of these tests,</text><text start="548.19" dur="0.833">right?
- Yeah.</text><text start="549.023" dur="2.677">- And it&amp;#39;s great because we
get these stories of people,</text><text start="551.7" dur="2.07">you know, literally, I
dropped my phone in the lake.</text><text start="553.77" dur="1.17">I couldn&amp;#39;t get it for two weeks.</text><text start="554.94" dur="2.94">I fished it out, it still
works. They&amp;#39;re super excited.</text><text start="557.88" dur="2.85">That said, to get the product there,</text><text start="560.73" dur="2.76">you&amp;#39;ve gotta design a
lot of seals, adhesives,</text><text start="563.49" dur="2.43">other things to make it perform that way,</text><text start="565.92" dur="2.28">which makes it a little harder
to do that battery repair.</text><text start="568.2" dur="1.35">You still need to do the battery repair,</text><text start="569.55" dur="1.62">so we need to make sure we have a solution</text><text start="571.17" dur="2.64">for customers to do that, which we do.</text><text start="573.81" dur="2.94">But it&amp;#39;s objectively
better for the customer</text><text start="576.75" dur="1.95">to have that reliability.</text><text start="578.7" dur="1.71">And it&amp;#39;s ultimately better for the planet,</text><text start="580.41" dur="1.38">because the failure rates</text><text start="581.79" dur="2.58">since we got to that
point have just dropped.</text><text start="584.37" dur="0.9">It&amp;#39;s plummeted, right?</text><text start="585.27" dur="2.01">The number of repairs that need to happen.</text><text start="587.28" dur="1.02">And every time you&amp;#39;re doing a repair,</text><text start="588.3" dur="1.86">you&amp;#39;re bringing in new materials,</text><text start="590.16" dur="1.68">you know, to replace whatever broke.</text><text start="591.84" dur="2.04">So you can actually do the math</text><text start="593.88" dur="1.92">and figure out there&amp;#39;s a threshold</text><text start="595.8" dur="2.49">at which if I can make it this durable,</text><text start="598.29" dur="3.27">then it&amp;#39;s better to have it a
little bit harder to repair,</text><text start="601.56" dur="1.44">&amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s gonna net out ahead.</text><text start="603" dur="0.96">- So yeah, that checks out.</text><text start="603.96" dur="1.71">I found that kind of interesting</text><text start="605.67" dur="1.11">that we&amp;#39;ve never really heard anyone</text><text start="606.78" dur="1.83">from Apple speak directly about this.</text><text start="608.61" dur="1.11">Now, of course, in a dream world,</text><text start="609.72" dur="3.03">if Apple&amp;#39;s goal is to
make the ultimate phone</text><text start="612.75" dur="2.13">that never ever breaks,</text><text start="614.88" dur="2.67">then they probably shouldn&amp;#39;t
be making it from glass.</text><text start="617.55" dur="3.78">&amp;#39;Cause in the words of
JerryRigEverything, glass is glass.</text><text start="621.33" dur="0.833">Glass breaks.</text><text start="622.163" dur="1.747">But still, they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text><text start="623.91" dur="1.47">as far towards that end as possible.</text><text start="625.38" dur="1.98">And it is interesting to hear a little bit</text><text start="627.36" dur="1.68">of the behind the scenes
on the philosophy there.</text><text start="629.04" dur="0.833">But yeah, that&amp;#39;s been it.</text><text start="629.873" dur="1.087">That&amp;#39;s my behind-the-scenes look</text><text start="630.96" dur="2.07">at Apple&amp;#39;s durability testing labs</text><text start="633.03" dur="1.32">that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before.</text><text start="634.35" dur="1.86">Make sure you subscribe to see more stuff,</text><text start="636.21" dur="2.31">very cool, like this coming up soon,</text><text start="638.52" dur="3.12">and let me know what you
think about this sliding scale</text><text start="641.64" dur="2.25">of durability versus repair.</text><text start="643.89" dur="2.906">Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.</text><text start="646.796" dur="3.333">(relaxing upbeat music)</text></transcript>
