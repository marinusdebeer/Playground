MKBHD here,</text><text start="71.604" dur="4.771">And today we&amp;#39;re going to
be talking about the 1984 Mac.</text><text start="76.442" dur="1.301">&lt;i&gt; The original.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="77.81" dur="2.969">&lt;i&gt; So this came out
 nine years before I was born,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="80.846" dur="3.304">so by the time I was actually
using computers,</text><text start="84.217" dur="2.602">this thing would have been
gathering dust in my
parents&amp;#39; basement.</text><text start="86.886" dur="2.002">This wasn&amp;#39;t the first ever
personal computer,</text><text start="88.955" dur="2.402">but this was the one
that changed the way we think</text><text start="91.424" dur="2.335">about what computers are
and what they can do.</text><text start="93.826" dur="1.301">It&amp;#39;s so easy to think of Apple</text><text start="95.194" dur="3.003">as this massive company,
because they are one now.</text><text start="98.264" dur="1.134">But it wasn&amp;#39;t always that way,</text><text start="99.465" dur="1.201">and this is one
of the computers</text><text start="100.733" dur="2.469">that helped define
what they&amp;#39;ve become today.</text><text start="103.269" dur="2.369">So, uh, let&amp;#39;s take
a closer look in the box.</text><text start="105.705" dur="2.902">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="108.674" dur="3.036">So, we got your user guide.
Oh, look at that.</text><text start="111.777" dur="3.036">That&amp;#39;s how you should be
using your Mac. Just kick back.</text><text start="114.88" dur="2.97">Apple stickers.
These are probably worth a lot.</text><text start="117.917" dur="1.968">Also, the plastic has
an Apple logo on it.</text><text start="119.952" dur="1.602">Even the plastic
is Apple plastic.</text><text start="121.621" dur="1.768">It&amp;#39;s special.</text><text start="123.456" dur="2.102">And there are two floppy disks--</text><text start="125.625" dur="2.635">&amp;quot;A Guided Tour of Macintosh&amp;quot;
and your system disk.</text><text start="128.327" dur="2.936">Don&amp;#39;t lose that.</text><text start="131.33" dur="1.969">Something about tech
at this time</text><text start="133.366" dur="2.068">is always this color
for some reason.</text><text start="135.501" dur="3.07">I don&amp;#39;t know why,
but that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at.</text><text start="138.638" dur="4.604">Ah, this is the keyboard.
Guess what color.</text><text start="143.309" dur="2.135">1980s brown.</text><text start="145.511" dur="2.803">All right, so I&amp;#39;m fully ready
for the Mac at this point.</text><text start="148.381" dur="1.034">That&amp;#39;s convenient, actually.</text><text start="149.482" dur="2.502">There&amp;#39;s a handle
right at the top.</text><text start="152.051" dur="2.335">We can just pick up
the whole Mac just like that.</text><text start="154.453" dur="2.336">Just like-- just like
a bowling ball, basically.</text><text start="156.856" dur="2.369">That&amp;#39;s about the weight
of a good bowling ball, too.</text><text start="159.292" dur="1.601">You know, tech demos these days
are always trying to show you</text><text start="160.96" dur="2.569">what you can do with it.
This was a very effective demo.</text><text start="163.596" dur="3.403">Oh, yeah. Come with me.
I have my computer with me.</text><text start="167.066" dur="1.601">Of course, you need to plug it
into the wall and everything,</text><text start="168.734" dur="1.335">but I like that handle.</text><text start="170.135" dur="2.771">So what do you say we, uh,
get this thing turned on?</text><text start="174.94" dur="2.503">( beeps )</text><text start="177.51" dur="3.037">( whirring )</text><text start="181.847" dur="1.835">( buzzing )</text><text start="183.749" dur="1.869">It&amp;#39;s making noises for sure.</text><text start="188.988" dur="2.469">All right.

a question mark.</text><text start="194.827" dur="2.669">Oh, I need the system disk,
don&amp;#39;t I?</text><text start="197.563" dur="2.936">Even in all this space,
there&amp;#39;s no internal memory.</text><text start="200.566" dur="3.203">There&amp;#39;s no way for it to know
how to start up without this.</text><text start="203.836" dur="2.636">This is the important piece
right here.</text><text start="206.539" dur="2.236">This is the OS.
This is the system.</text><text start="213.779" dur="2.536">That&amp;#39;s still super-satisfying.</text><text start="216.382" dur="1.468">Would you look at that?</text><text start="217.917" dur="1.868">&amp;quot;Welcome to Macintosh.&amp;quot;</text><text start="219.852" dur="1.134">Let&amp;#39;s get into it.</text><text start="221.053" dur="2.502">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="223.622" dur="2.803">&lt;i&gt; The OG Macintosh is something
 I know very little about.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="226.492" dur="3.436">&lt;i&gt; In fact, I didn&amp;#39;t even own
 a Mac until 2010.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="229.995" dur="1.835">&lt;i&gt; But I always see that &amp;#39;84 Mac&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="231.897" dur="2.636">&lt;i&gt; referenced as one of
 the most important computers&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="234.6" dur="3.336">&lt;i&gt; of all time, which seems like
 a pretty big deal.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="238.003" dur="2.636">&lt;i&gt; So what is it about
 the original 1984 Mac&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="240.706" dur="1.969">&lt;i&gt; that changed the game

- Oh, look at that!</text><text start="258.557" dur="4.371">And there it is, the original

the computer industry</text><text start="285.484" dur="3.103">&lt;i&gt; was really found

 It was something
 that companies did&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="294.193" dur="2.602">&lt;i&gt; to crunch massive amounts
 of data.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="296.862" dur="2.035">The original computers, they
were very cinematic in a way.</text><text start="298.964" dur="2.102">&lt;i&gt; They took up an entire room.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="301.133" dur="1.868">&lt;i&gt;They had the giant reel-to-reel

 making computers,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="329.662" dur="3.169">but they had no concept
of the home computer.</text><text start="332.898" dur="2.069">&lt;i&gt; How are you gonna take
 an idea like the computer,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="335.034" dur="2.702">&lt;i&gt; this big room-size

 a mainstream thing?&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="339.538" dur="2.903">Well, the answer
is the microprocessor.</text><text start="342.508" dur="2.202">&lt;i&gt; Pioneered in the early &amp;#39;70s,
 it basically said&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="344.777" dur="1.935">&lt;i&gt; we can take the brain
 of the computer&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="346.779" dur="2.035">&lt;i&gt; and shrink it down
 to micro-size.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="348.881" dur="3.803">Humphrey:&lt;i&gt;
 So that really allows for
 smaller, faster,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="352.751" dur="1.301">&lt;i&gt; and much cheaper hardware.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="354.119" dur="1.835">&lt;i&gt; And I think Steve Jobs
 was such a visionary&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="356.021" dur="3.003">that he saw where
that could go.</text><text start="359.091" dur="2.969">&lt;i&gt; Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="362.127" dur="2.97">Ronald Wayne, they were

back then this was obviously</text><text start="495.327" dur="1.201">something that
was revolutionary</text><text start="496.595" dur="3.17">until this over here--
the RadioShack Tandy.</text><text start="499.832" dur="2.936">And it&amp;#39;s crazy, because

and the power button on this</text><text start="527.66" dur="2.669">are already immensely better
than any computer I have now.</text><text start="530.396" dur="1.868">- Yeah.
- The power buttons
  on today&amp;#39;s computers?</text><text start="532.331" dur="2.802">- They don&amp;#39;t live up to these.
- Then we come down here,</text><text start="535.2" dur="1.869">and this is where things
kind of get crazy.</text><text start="537.136" dur="3.603">So this is the first
introduction to a personal
computer by IBM.</text><text start="540.806" dur="2.269">&lt;i&gt; This came out around 1981.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="543.142" dur="3.069">IBM was the computer company
at that time, so they&amp;#39;re huge.</text><text start="546.278" dur="2.536">Marques:
It&amp;#39;s got a much more
monolithic look.</text><text start="548.881" dur="2.135">And IBM was kind of late
to get into the, sort of,
personal computer...</text><text start="551.083" dur="1.835">- Right.
- ...because they were mostly
  focused on business.</text><text start="552.985" dur="2.302">This wasn&amp;#39;t something
they thought was going
to be a success.</text><text start="555.354" dur="4.938">And this is kind of
what started the huge conflict
with Mac versus PC.</text><text start="560.359" dur="2.669">- This is it?
  There&amp;#39;s notably no mouse.
- Yeah.</text><text start="563.095" dur="1.301">And what&amp;#39;s crazy
is this is the only way
that you were able</text><text start="564.463" dur="1.568">to communicate with your
computer-- command lines.</text><text start="566.098" dur="3.303">- You had to know what to
  type to make it work.
- Yeah.</text><text start="569.468" dur="2.235">It&amp;#39;s cool,
but it&amp;#39;s not very fun.</text><text start="571.77" dur="4.238">- Right.
- Then next, this is
  the Compaq-Portable 286,</text><text start="576.075" dur="1.601">&lt;i&gt; and what&amp;#39;s nuts about this&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="577.743" dur="2.335">&lt;i&gt; is this was meant to be
 taken places.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="580.145" dur="2.87">There&amp;#39;s these little notches
right here, so this keyboard
actually folds up into this.</text><text start="583.082" dur="1.935">And there&amp;#39;s
a luggage handle on the back.</text><text start="585.084" dur="1.768">Just go take a little look.
Just go look.</text><text start="586.919" dur="1.401">If you&amp;#39;re going to call it
portable, you need a handle.</text><text start="588.387" dur="3.57">Portable? Um, I&amp;#39;d put that
in air quotes for sure.</text><text start="592.024" dur="2.769">It&amp;#39;s like a suitcase.</text><text start="594.86" dur="4.204">So, the personal computer
from the mega-goliath IBM</text><text start="599.131" dur="1.735">sets, like,
waves for the industry.</text><text start="600.933" dur="3.903">And then the copycats,
they&amp;#39;re trying to do things</text><text start="604.903" dur="2.035">like be a little cheaper
or a little more portable</text><text start="607.005" dur="2.936">or have their little gimmick
that sells them over IBM.</text><text start="610.008" dur="3.137">- This was the start
  of the clones, so--
- The clone wars.</text><text start="613.212" dur="1.602">The clone wars. I mean,
it definitely happened,</text><text start="614.88" dur="4.838">and that was in sort of
this time frame before
the 1984 Mac.</text><text start="619.785" dur="3.136">- That leads us to this.
- The Mac.</text><text start="622.988" dur="2.936">- It&amp;#39;s so beautiful.
- It&amp;#39;s notably smaller</text><text start="625.991" dur="2.369">-&lt;i&gt; than the other two by a lot. &lt;/i&gt;
-&lt;i&gt; And it&amp;#39;s so insane,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="628.427" dur="3.637">because everything
was stored on these disks.</text><text start="632.131" dur="3.77">So if you wanted to boot
the system, you&amp;#39;d have to
use the floppy disk.</text><text start="635.968" dur="1.668">And then if you wanted
to play a game, you&amp;#39;d
have to take that out,</text><text start="637.703" dur="3.169">put another disk in.
And then if it&amp;#39;s like,
&amp;quot;Oh, hold on a second.</text><text start="640.939" dur="1.769">I need something back
from this system memory,&amp;quot;</text><text start="642.775" dur="1.568">- you&amp;#39;d have to swap &amp;#39;em out.
- Yeah.</text><text start="644.41" dur="3.503">So it was such a process
because it is loading
everything into the RAM,</text><text start="647.98" dur="1.801">and you obviously don&amp;#39;t have
a lot of it to work with.</text><text start="649.848" dur="2.436">- Not a ton of storage.
- And I always will remember,</text><text start="652.351" dur="2.535">I think I was probably
in college whenever
Apple was like,</text><text start="654.953" dur="2.97">&amp;quot;We are not gonna have a floppy
drive in our computers.&amp;quot;</text><text start="657.99" dur="2.402">We&amp;#39;re like,
&amp;quot;No, what do you mean?
We need that.&amp;quot;</text><text start="660.459" dur="1.701">Apple is kind of known
for killing off ports</text><text start="662.227" dur="1.068">they don&amp;#39;t think
we need anymore.</text><text start="663.361" dur="2.069">- Headphone jack?
- Headphone jack.</text><text start="665.497" dur="3.003">-&lt;i&gt; Don&amp;#39;t need it. &lt;/i&gt;
-&lt;i&gt; Don&amp;#39;t really need
 that anymore.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="668.567" dur="1.568">-&lt;i&gt; FireWire I think
 they killed off. &lt;/i&gt;
-&lt;i&gt; CD drive.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="670.202" dur="2.569">Marques:&lt;i&gt;
 CD drive, they were early
 to get rid of that.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="672.838" dur="2.535">-&lt;i&gt; Full size USB. &lt;/i&gt;
-&lt;i&gt; Yep, all of it.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="675.44" dur="1.435">But, yeah,
floppy drive&amp;#39;s another one.</text><text start="676.941" dur="2.436">Justine:
This was one of the first
computers with a mouse.</text><text start="679.444" dur="2.536">There are no arrow keys
on this keyboard.</text><text start="682.047" dur="2.769">- Oh, right.
- That was to force the user
  to learn to use the mouse.</text><text start="684.883" dur="1.134">And I thought that was something
that&amp;#39;s really interesting,</text><text start="686.084" dur="1.902">because even though
you do use a mouse,</text><text start="688.053" dur="2.335">I think those arrow keys
are pretty helpful.</text><text start="690.455" dur="2.002">This may be the first instance
of Apple killing off something</text><text start="692.524" dur="2.569">- and then bringing
  it back later.
- Yes, yes.</text><text start="695.16" dur="3.804">- Okay, fair.
- So we gotta turn it on.</text><text start="699.031" dur="2.102">Okay, here we go.
I&amp;#39;m gonna give this to you.</text><text start="701.2" dur="1.768">Yeah. Oh, there it is.</text><text start="703.035" dur="1.868">- It&amp;#39;s saying &amp;quot;no disk.&amp;quot;
- Oh, gosh. Okay, hold on.</text><text start="704.97" dur="2.836">I gotta come around.
I gotta see this.</text><text start="707.873" dur="2.235">- &amp;quot;Welcome to Macintosh.&amp;quot;
- Look at this.</text><text start="710.175" dur="3.036">Looking at this next to
the last two computers,</text><text start="713.278" dur="3.003">I mean, green text on
a black screen, mouse, UI--</text><text start="716.348" dur="3.203">- This 1984 Mac really did
  change everything.
- Right.</text><text start="719.618" dur="2.936">It&amp;#39;s what made graphical
user interface popular.</text><text start="722.621" dur="2.202">Marques:
Dragging something
to a trash can</text><text start="724.89" dur="3.97">is such an obvious
mental visual to have.</text><text start="728.927" dur="1.869">- Yeah.
- But that&amp;#39;s one of the first
  times they do that.</text><text start="730.862" dur="4.204">Yeah. I mean, this is
essentially the same setup
that we currently have now.</text><text start="735.133" dur="1.268">- It&amp;#39;s a Mac OS.
- More or less, yeah.</text><text start="736.468" dur="1.568">I mean, you still have
that Apple menu up there.</text><text start="738.103" dur="3.103">Look at this!
Oh, man, I&amp;#39;m freaking out.
This is so great.</text><text start="741.273" dur="1.902">Do you want to try
typing on it?</text><text start="743.242" dur="3.336">- ( keyboard clacking )
- The sound you get, too,
  is, like, kind of unique.</text><text start="746.645" dur="3.236">( clacking )</text><text start="749.948" dur="1.969">- Yeah, it&amp;#39;s good.
- It&amp;#39;s so great.</text><text start="751.984" dur="2.202">- They don&amp;#39;t make &amp;#39;em
  like they used to.
- They don&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="754.253" dur="1.301">Marques:&lt;i&gt;
 Now that I&amp;#39;ve seen&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="755.621" dur="2.869">&lt;i&gt; some of the Macintosh&amp;#39;s
 competitors firsthand,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="758.557" dur="3.303">&lt;i&gt; I want to know
 how did Apple take on
 its biggest threat,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="761.927" dur="2.302">&lt;i&gt; computer giant IBM?&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="764.296" dur="3.27">Back then, Apple was still
the little David company
versus the Goliath.</text><text start="767.633" dur="1.601">Newscaster:&lt;i&gt;
 Industry analysts
 predicted that Apple,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="769.301" dur="1.868">&lt;i&gt; like many other
 smaller companies,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="771.236" dur="1.235">&lt;i&gt; would be forced out
 of business.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="772.537" dur="2.536">I think Steve Jobs enjoyed
being the underdog.</text><text start="775.14" dur="4.037">I think Apple is the only thing
standing between them</text><text start="779.244" dur="1.568">and total industry dominance.</text><text start="780.879" dur="1.268">Humphrey:&lt;i&gt;
 So Steve Jobs and the rest
 of their crew,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="782.214" dur="2.536">&lt;i&gt; they knew they were going to
 have to come up&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="784.816" dur="2.036">&lt;i&gt; with something spectacular
 to put a dent in the universe.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="786.919" dur="2.268">I was the Creative Director
of Apple for,</text><text start="789.254" dur="2.035">like, 17 years altogether.</text><text start="791.356" dur="1.902">There were a number of things
about working with Steve.</text><text start="793.325" dur="3.603">First thing was he was smart.
And I mean, like, really smart.</text><text start="796.995" dur="2.069">&lt;i&gt; But what really set him apart&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="799.131" dur="1.835">&lt;i&gt; was the marketing
 side of him.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="801.033" dur="1.268">&lt;i&gt; I&amp;#39;ve worked with
 many big companies.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="802.368" dur="3.135">&lt;i&gt; I&amp;#39;ve never met a CEO
 who had that passion&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="805.57" dur="2.369">&lt;i&gt; and talent for marketing.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="808.006" dur="1.969">He knew that every product
had to tell a story.</text><text start="810.042" dur="2.435">Humphrey:&lt;i&gt;
 So Apple created a commercial.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="812.544" dur="2.703">&lt;i&gt; It was in, I think,
 the third quarter
 of the Super Bowl,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="815.314" dur="3.002">so you had all of the eyeballs
of America on this thing.</text><text start="818.383" dur="3.57">&lt;i&gt; They got Ridley Scott
 of all people to direct
 this commercial.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="822.02" dur="3.237">Ackerman:&lt;i&gt;

 on George Orwell&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;1984.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="825.324" dur="2.602">Humphrey:&lt;i&gt;
 There was Big Brother
 out there watching you,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="827.993" dur="2.502">and they sort of likened IBM
to Big Brother.</text><text start="830.562" dur="2.602">Ackerman:&lt;i&gt;

introduce itself</text><text start="898.563" dur="2.703">&lt;i&gt; was Steve&amp;#39;s big moment to say,
 &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re different.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="901.333" dur="4.771">Marques:&lt;i&gt; The 1984 Mac
 was different than everything
 else at the time,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="906.171" dur="4.07">&lt;i&gt; but it was still limited
 compared to what we have now.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="910.308" dur="2.236">&lt;i&gt; There wasn&amp;#39;t much
 internal storage on the Mac,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="912.611" dur="1.901">&lt;i&gt; but it left room for
 third party developers&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="914.579" dur="2.736">&lt;i&gt; to create a multitude
 of software.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="917.382" dur="3.136">&lt;i&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve invited a special guest

- Whoa.</text><text start="989.721" dur="1.468">- Muscle memory.
- Yeah, it&amp;#39;s muscle memory.</text><text start="991.256" dur="4.204">- Huh.

  It&amp;#39;s plotting North America.</text><text start="995.527" dur="1.301">- So you can probably
  zoom back in.

  &amp;quot;Asteroids.&amp;quot;
- Yeah.</text><text start="1035.667" dur="1.968">So you click it,

  Come on.</text><text start="1044.209" dur="2.936">I didn&amp;#39;t move at all.
Wait, I don&amp;#39;t know
how to move my, uh...</text><text start="1047.212" dur="2.402">- There you go.
  You got it to rotate.
- Z and X, okay.</text><text start="1049.681" dur="2.803">- Z and X are my rotation.
- ( beeps )</text><text start="1052.551" dur="3.937">- Oh, you got yourself blasted.
- The physics of this
  are fascinating.</text><text start="1056.555" dur="2.669">- Okay. I think I can--
  oh, oh, oh, oh!
- There you go.</text><text start="1059.291" dur="1.935">It&amp;#39;s just eating us alive.
There you go.</text><text start="1061.293" dur="2.035">- I&amp;#39;m gonna spin you around
  and get this one right here.
- I&amp;#39;m spinning around.</text><text start="1063.395" dur="1.235">How about that move?
How about that move?</text><text start="1064.696" dur="1.935">Get some of that.
Get some of that, asteroid.</text><text start="1066.698" dur="2.068">With practice,
it wouldn&amp;#39;t take two people.</text><text start="1068.833" dur="2.603">- Take me down there. Yes.
- There it is.</text><text start="1071.503" dur="3.036">- 2,080? Oh, killing it.
- 2,080 for just one thing.</text><text start="1074.606" dur="2.068">Killing it.
I think &amp;quot;Asteroids&amp;quot; is dope,
right off the bat.</text><text start="1076.741" dur="1.501">I think it&amp;#39;s dope.
I think it&amp;#39;s so dope.</text><text start="1078.309" dur="1.068">- I got no problem
  with &amp;quot;Asteroids.&amp;quot;
- I&amp;#39;m doping up.</text><text start="1079.444" dur="1.168">- That was awesome.
- So here&amp;#39;s the floppy.</text><text start="1080.678" dur="2.57">So what I have to do
to start the next one</text><text start="1083.315" dur="1.835">is I have to get rid
of this floppy
and start the next one?</text><text start="1085.217" dur="2.535">- Cha-chunk it.
- I have to cha-chunk it?</text><text start="1087.819" dur="2.502">Do you know how to get back
to the main screen from here?</text><text start="1090.388" dur="2.436">Well, you gotta eject
and it&amp;#39;s not ejecting.</text><text start="1092.891" dur="2.569">Now, what we would
have to do,</text><text start="1095.527" dur="1.368">and I&amp;#39;m not saying--
see this hole?</text><text start="1096.962" dur="3.236">- Mm-hmm.
- You would take
  a bent paper clip,</text><text start="1100.265" dur="2.002">push it in that hole,
and it would eject,</text><text start="1102.334" dur="3.369">but that seems like
a catastrophic move,
doesn&amp;#39;t it?</text><text start="1105.77" dur="3.47">Yeah, there&amp;#39;s gotta be a way.</text><text start="1109.307" dur="2.169">So does anybody have
a paper clip?</text><text start="1111.543" dur="4.638">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1116.248" dur="3.937">So, teach a man to fish--
gently push it in this hole.</text><text start="1120.252" dur="1.702">- Gently.
- ( clicks )</text><text start="1122.02" dur="1.835">- Oh, I had to go-- okay,
  all right, all right.
- There you go.</text><text start="1123.922" dur="2.402">But still, that was
a catastrophic failure.</text><text start="1126.391" dur="2.302">I think we want to cycle
the power off.</text><text start="1128.76" dur="2.636">- Off.
- And then let that CRT,</text><text start="1131.463" dur="4.237">that cathode ray tube
shut itself down.</text><text start="1135.767" dur="2.702">Let the electronics drain.</text><text start="1138.536" dur="3.037">- Drain, man.
- ( Marques chuckles )</text><text start="1141.64" dur="3.102">- ( beeps ) 
- Three, two.</text><text start="1144.809" dur="3.07">- Look how happy he or she is.
- That is adorable.</text><text start="1147.946" dur="2.002">It&amp;#39;s adorbs.
Totally adorbs.</text><text start="1150.015" dur="3.269">Marques:
Okay, the last one
is &amp;quot;Mac Surgeon.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1153.351" dur="3.537">All right, &amp;quot;Mac Surgeon.&amp;quot;
What do you want? Body parts?
And here we go.</text><text start="1156.955" dur="3.903">&amp;quot;Mr. Thomas Jones,
a 65-year-old-man with a history
of heart problems,</text><text start="1160.925" dur="1.802">came in with problems
of lower back pain.</text><text start="1162.794" dur="1.968">You thought he felt
a pulsating mass in the abdomen.</text><text start="1164.829" dur="3.17">You ordered X-rays of the
abdomen. They showed nothing.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1168.066" dur="2.536">- I think we gotta order
  an ultrasonic.
- That&amp;#39;s the spine?</text><text start="1170.669" dur="2.802">- We&amp;#39;re learning as we go.
- Please insert
  the disk &amp;quot;Others.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1173.538" dur="2.803">- This was how we rolled, man.
- Oh, my goodness.</text><text start="1176.408" dur="3.069">It was not the good old days.
It was the old days.</text><text start="1179.544" dur="3.77">- Let&amp;#39;s operate.
- Let&amp;#39;s operate. Sure.</text><text start="1183.381" dur="1.368">- He&amp;#39;s got a tear.
- Let&amp;#39;s make an incision.</text><text start="1184.816" dur="1.735">- Where? Right about here?
- Yeah, right up the center.</text><text start="1186.618" dur="2.936">- Oh. There you go.
- There it goes. Went around
  the belly button.</text><text start="1189.621" dur="3.003">Pressure&amp;#39;s now a hundred--
then what are we doing?</text><text start="1192.691" dur="1.935">Marques: How realistic is--
are we sewing this back up?</text><text start="1194.693" dur="2.936">I guess so.
I&amp;#39;m really not sure
what we&amp;#39;re doing.</text><text start="1197.696" dur="2.201">Ooh, this one.
This is a needle and thread.</text><text start="1199.964" dur="2.803">Okay.
His blood pressure&amp;#39;s dropping.</text><text start="1202.834" dur="2.536">- He&amp;#39;ll be fine.
- Well, okay. You may be right.</text><text start="1205.437" dur="2.435">- Marques: What?
- He&amp;#39;s bleeding like crazy, man.</text><text start="1207.939" dur="3.37">- Uh, maybe he&amp;#39;s not
  doing so good.
- ( flatline )</text><text start="1211.376" dur="1.068">&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, doctor.
The patient&amp;#39;s heart
has stopped.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1212.51" dur="3.937">You say that like
that&amp;#39;s a big deal.</text><text start="1216.514" dur="2.269">- Um, we could play again?
- Well...</text><text start="1218.85" dur="2.836">- But it&amp;#39;s quite troubling.
- So where are you at
  on this one?</text><text start="1221.753" dur="3.203">- I think this has
  potential for dope.
- On the nope or dope scale?</text><text start="1225.023" dur="2.402">But I&amp;#39;d have to spend
a lot more time.</text><text start="1227.492" dur="2.369">This seems like one
that has a bit of
a higher learning curve.</text><text start="1229.928" dur="2.569">Yes. Higher learning curve.</text><text start="1232.564" dur="4.104">- Yeah. I&amp;#39;m gonna
  give this a nope.
- Yes!</text><text start="1236.735" dur="2.602">So, I appreciate you helping out
with the Dope Or Nope segment.</text><text start="1239.404" dur="1.802">I&amp;#39;m learning a lot
about the original Mac.</text><text start="1241.273" dur="3.103">- This has been a lot of fun.
  Appreciate it.
- Let&amp;#39;s change the world.</text><text start="1249.047" dur="1.468">Marques:&lt;i&gt;
 Steve Jobs knew that in order&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1250.582" dur="2.969">&lt;i&gt; to differentiate the Macintosh
 from its competitors,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1253.618" dur="1.902">&lt;i&gt; he&amp;#39;d need to get it
 on the radar&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1255.587" dur="3.937">&lt;i&gt; of both the tech crowd
 and the &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; crowd.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1259.591" dur="2.769">Humphrey:&lt;i&gt;
 Steve Jobs really did
 a great job&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1262.427" dur="2.302">of getting Macintosh into
the hands of influencers.</text><text start="1264.796" dur="3.703">&lt;i&gt; He gifted it
 to John Lennon&amp;#39;s son Sean.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1268.566" dur="2.302">&lt;i&gt; And then Andy Warhol
 got his hands on one,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1270.935" dur="3.67">&lt;i&gt; and actually ended up
 using it in one of his
 art installations.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1274.672" dur="1.435">&lt;i&gt; Steve Jobs created that buzz&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1276.174" dur="2.269">&lt;i&gt; because if
 the cool people like it,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1278.51" dur="1.768">then, of course,
everybody&amp;#39;s gonna like it.</text><text start="1280.345" dur="2.669">Ackerman:&lt;i&gt;
 The Macintosh really conquered
 the popular conception&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1283.081" dur="1.201">&lt;i&gt; of what a computer should be.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1284.349" dur="1.368">&lt;i&gt; And they said,
 &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re gonna make sure&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1285.784" dur="1.168">&lt;i&gt; you have the software tools
 that you need most&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1287.018" dur="2.703">&lt;i&gt; so you&amp;#39;re gonna buy
 our machine.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1289.788" dur="1.968">&lt;i&gt; Here&amp;#39;s MacWrite.
 Here&amp;#39;s MacPaint.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1291.823" dur="3.136">When MacPaint came out,
it allowed creatives</text><text start="1295.026" dur="3.704">&lt;i&gt; to make what they do
 orders of magnitude easier.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1298.797" dur="3.069">&lt;i&gt; So you really only need
 your own creativity,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1301.933" dur="2.202">&lt;i&gt; and it&amp;#39;s absolutely
 a straight line to Photoshop.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1304.202" dur="1.601">It all started with MacPaint.</text><text start="1305.87" dur="2.703">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1308.64" dur="1.768">Marques:&lt;i&gt;
 Some artists,
 like Pinot Ichwandardi,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1310.475" dur="2.535">&lt;i&gt; are still using
 MacPaint today.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1313.077" dur="2.636">&lt;i&gt; Many of his works
 have gone viral,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1315.78" dur="2.869">&lt;i&gt; like his animation
 of Donald Glover&amp;#39;s
 &amp;quot;This is America.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1318.716" dur="2.236">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1325.657" dur="2.235">Wow.
It&amp;#39;s the Brooklyn Bridge,</text><text start="1327.959" dur="1.668">but represented with a super,</text><text start="1329.694" dur="1.368">super detailed, like,
individual pixels.</text><text start="1331.129" dur="1.769">Yeah...</text><text start="1333.998" dur="1.002">Marques:
Whoa.</text><text start="1337.135" dur="1.435">Yeah.</text><text start="1339.671" dur="2.202">Wow, that&amp;#39;s crazy.</text><text start="1341.94" dur="2.735">Why continue to use
this computer</text><text start="1344.742" dur="2.604">versus all
the crazy modern stuff
we have available now?</text><text start="1359.157" dur="1.435">I&amp;#39;m a terrible artist.</text><text start="1361.926" dur="0.934">We&amp;#39;ll try it,
we&amp;#39;ll try it.</text><text start="1362.927" dur="3.004">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1370.768" dur="2.77">Everything they do
is gonna be new to people
at this time.</text><text start="1373.605" dur="2.436">- Yeah.
- So everything they do is sort
  of revolutionary in a way.</text><text start="1377.242" dur="1.568">Let me put the finishing
touches on this.</text><text start="1380.612" dur="1.434">I mean, I drew a whole tree,
and you can--</text><text start="1382.113" dur="1.435">can you tell it&amp;#39;s a tree?</text><text start="1390.154" dur="3.904">I appreciate how generous
you&amp;#39;re being about my drawing.</text><text start="1394.125" dur="3.637">- ( laughing )
- I sent you a video
  not too long ago...</text><text start="1397.829" dur="1.368">- Mm-hmm.
- ...with a little bit
  of movement in it.</text><text start="1399.264" dur="1.935">This is that video.</text><text start="1401.266" dur="3.469">And you had some time to make
an animated version of it,</text><text start="1404.802" dur="3.104">- which I&amp;#39;m super excited
  to possibly see.
- Yeah.</text><text start="1418.216" dur="2.936">Marques:
And it would kind of be
the first animation software</text><text start="1421.219" dur="1.768">anyone could get
their hands on...</text><text start="1423.054" dur="2.769">- Yeah.
- ...as far as personal
  hobbyist animation.</text><text start="1425.89" dur="1.536">Yeah, yeah.</text><text start="1432.697" dur="1.802">Look at that.
That&amp;#39;s so good.</text><text start="1438.67" dur="1.535">- ( laughter )
- Yeah.</text><text start="1452.116" dur="1.436">Wait, I gotta look back
at the video now.</text><text start="1456.621" dur="2.937">Yeah. The amount of pixels
being held next to each other.</text><text start="1460.725" dur="2.236">Yeah, thank you.</text><text start="1464.896" dur="3.003">&lt;i&gt; ( music playing )&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1467.966" dur="2.902">&lt;i&gt; Even if the 1984 Mac
wasn&amp;#39;t your childhood computer,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1470.935" dur="3.136">&lt;i&gt; we&amp;#39;ve all been impacted
 by Apple&amp;#39;s innovation&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1474.138" dur="2.736">&lt;i&gt; over the last three decades.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1476.941" dur="3.971">The legacy of the Macintosh
is the fact that</text><text start="1480.979" dur="4.17">&lt;i&gt; Steve Jobs was able to put
a computer in all of our homes.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1485.216" dur="2.836">Bill Nye:&lt;i&gt;
 They literally flipped
 the chart at Apple.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1488.119" dur="3.17">&lt;i&gt; &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re gonna make the user
 the main person here.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1491.356" dur="4.237">- It&amp;#39;s just a cool idea.
- It changed the computer from
  being an industrial tool</text><text start="1495.66" dur="3.003">&lt;i&gt; to something that is like
 a pair of eyeglasses.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1498.73" dur="2.168">&lt;i&gt; Something that&amp;#39;s useful,
 but very personal,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1500.965" dur="1.969">&lt;i&gt; and you make that choice
 based on how you feel&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1503.001" dur="2.902">it reflects you outward
as well as inward.</text><text start="1505.97" dur="1.969">Panitz:&lt;i&gt;
 The Macintosh computer&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1508.006" dur="2.201">&lt;i&gt; not only changed the way
 we use computers,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1510.274" dur="3.504">but also has pigeonholed
the computer industry</text><text start="1513.845" dur="2.736">&lt;i&gt; into just doing what they do.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1516.648" dur="2.402">It was the human
technology company,</text><text start="1519.117" dur="3.203">&lt;i&gt; and it was about pushing
 the human race forward,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1522.387" dur="3.403">&lt;i&gt; and Steve did
 an amazingly good job&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1525.857" dur="3.103">of pushing
the human race forward.</text><text start="1529.027" dur="1.868">Marques:&lt;i&gt;

 and swiping on a screen,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1537.869" dur="2.836">there is a gigantic chunk
of humanity</text><text start="1540.772" dur="3.469">&lt;i&gt; that knows computers
 as a mouse,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1544.308" dur="3.304">a keyboard, a screen,
and an OS.</text><text start="1547.679" dur="5.171">&lt;i&gt; And that is thanks
 in major part to the 1984 Mac&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1552.917" dur="2.202">&lt;i&gt; and the vision behind it.
 It&amp;#39;s pretty incredible.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1555.186" dur="2.803">Thanks for watching.
