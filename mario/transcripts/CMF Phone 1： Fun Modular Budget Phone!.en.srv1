<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="2.807">(logo chiming)</text><text start="2.807" dur="3.083">(soft upbeat music)</text><text start="13.86" dur="3.99">- All right, so CMF Phone 1 by Nothing</text><text start="17.85" dur="1.89">is kind of a confusing name,</text><text start="19.74" dur="2.31">but what this phone&amp;#39;s trying to do,</text><text start="22.05" dur="0.833">not confusing at all.</text><text start="22.883" dur="0.833">Love it or hate it,</text><text start="23.716" dur="3.254">this is one of the most
interesting new phones in the world</text><text start="26.97" dur="0.833">at the moment.</text><text start="27.803" dur="1.964">Because Nothing came along
a few years ago and said,</text><text start="29.767" dur="3.36">&amp;quot;Hey, what if we tried to
make an average budget phone</text><text start="33.127" dur="4.493">&amp;quot;but with a focus on software and design?&amp;quot;</text><text start="37.62" dur="2.01">And it kinda worked, those
phones are pretty good.</text><text start="39.63" dur="4.77">And so now, CMF is the
budget sub-brand of Nothing,</text><text start="44.4" dur="1.057">and they&amp;#39;ve come along and said,</text><text start="45.457" dur="4.313">&amp;quot;Hey, well, what if we did
the same thing but even more?&amp;quot;</text><text start="49.77" dur="2.16">So that&amp;#39;s how you end up with this.</text><text start="51.93" dur="2.91">This is a $200 Android phone</text><text start="54.84" dur="2.64">that on paper doesn&amp;#39;t
really stand out specs-wise</text><text start="57.48" dur="3.81">in the sea of other $200
Android phones that you can get</text><text start="61.29" dur="2.19">but it absolutely does stand out</text><text start="63.48" dur="1.98">with its software and design.</text><text start="65.46" dur="2.1">And I just wanna start
with the design first</text><text start="67.56" dur="1.95">because that&amp;#39;s the most interesting thing</text><text start="69.51" dur="1.2">about this phone by a mile.</text><text start="70.71" dur="2.79">So this is the CMF phone in black.</text><text start="73.5" dur="2.49">And on the surface it&amp;#39;s
nothing too crazy, right?</text><text start="75.99" dur="1.35">It&amp;#39;s got flat sides,</text><text start="77.34" dur="1.68">pretty average bezels all the way around</text><text start="79.02" dur="1.95">this big AMOLED display,</text><text start="80.97" dur="2.73">and dual cameras up in
the corner on the back.</text><text start="83.7" dur="1.71">But then you realize two things,</text><text start="85.41" dur="2.07">first, there&amp;#39;s a knob,</text><text start="87.48" dur="3.63">like a dial down here at the
bottom corner of the phone.</text><text start="91.11" dur="2.82">And second, there&amp;#39;s also a
bunch of these metal screws</text><text start="93.93" dur="1.59">all the way around the outside.</text><text start="95.52" dur="3.84">And that&amp;#39;s because this plastic
back is completely removable</text><text start="99.36" dur="2.19">and replaceable in a
couple different colors,</text><text start="101.55" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s black, there&amp;#39;s also
orange, there is a blue</text><text start="105.57" dur="1.53">and there is a light blue,</text><text start="107.1" dur="2.19">which also kinda has a
little green hue to it</text><text start="109.29" dur="0.99">depending on who you ask.</text><text start="110.28" dur="4.08">So right off the bat, this
idea is pretty unique.</text><text start="114.36" dur="2.73">Like for any phone,
especially at this price,</text><text start="117.09" dur="3.39">I remember back in the Moto
Maker days a while ago,</text><text start="120.48" dur="1.77">you could sort of customize your phone</text><text start="122.25" dur="1.62">but that was also much more permanent.</text><text start="123.87" dur="0.96">And it&amp;#39;s been many years</text><text start="124.83" dur="2.73">since we had removable backs on phones.</text><text start="127.56" dur="2.01">And even though nothing else comes off</text><text start="129.57" dur="1.41">and the battery isn&amp;#39;t removable</text><text start="130.98" dur="3.63">and the back still feels
super cheap and flexible,</text><text start="134.61" dur="2.4">because it is, but once it&amp;#39;s on the phone,</text><text start="137.01" dur="1.41">it feels pretty rigid and sturdy</text><text start="138.42" dur="3.15">and it&amp;#39;s still cool to see the
ability to change the color</text><text start="141.57" dur="1.95">and it&amp;#39;s a convenient little upsell</text><text start="143.52" dur="2.37">for the company that&amp;#39;s
selling the phone itself</text><text start="145.89" dur="0.833">for so cheap.</text><text start="146.723" dur="1.597">So then in the box for the cover,</text><text start="148.32" dur="3.69">you also get this little
orange combo sim ejector tool</text><text start="152.01" dur="2.91">and flat head screwdriver
since you&amp;#39;ll need this tool</text><text start="154.92" dur="1.95">to remove the sim card tray</text><text start="156.87" dur="2.73">and all of the screws to get the back off.</text><text start="159.6" dur="3.42">And then it comes with a
matching sim card tray and dial</text><text start="163.02" dur="2.4">to pop on the back so that
everything matches up.</text><text start="165.42" dur="2.4">But you can also totally
mix and match if you want,</text><text start="167.82" dur="1.41">it kinda makes the phone maybe feel</text><text start="169.23" dur="1.56">a little bit more like your own.</text><text start="170.79" dur="1.77">So the color changing back is one thing,</text><text start="172.56" dur="2.67">but then there&amp;#39;s also this
knob I keep pointing at</text><text start="175.23" dur="3.15">down here in the corner, and
this is a separate feature.</text><text start="178.38" dur="3.27">So I remember they first
started teasing this on Twitter,</text><text start="181.65" dur="1.86">we were trying to figure out
like on the Waveform Podcast,</text><text start="183.51" dur="1.41">like what is this gonna be?</text><text start="184.92" dur="1.77">Is this a volume knob?</text><text start="186.69" dur="2.13">Is this gonna be just like a fidget toy</text><text start="188.82" dur="2.49">or is it a mapable
thing with the software?</text><text start="191.31" dur="2.1">Like what&amp;#39;s the knob?</text><text start="193.41" dur="4.26">And it turns out, it&amp;#39;s a
mounting, attaching point,</text><text start="197.67" dur="0.87">for some accessories.</text><text start="198.54" dur="2.22">So it&amp;#39;s not like something
that spins freely,</text><text start="200.76" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s kinda just a fancy
thumbscrew with a colorful cap.</text><text start="204.24" dur="2.25">And if you take it off, you can replace it</text><text start="206.49" dur="2.64">with one of three accessories
that they&amp;#39;ve made so far.</text><text start="209.13" dur="1.38">There is a kickstand,</text><text start="210.51" dur="3.18">which lets you prop up your
phone on like a flat table</text><text start="213.69" dur="1.14">or a surface.</text><text start="214.83" dur="2.16">There&amp;#39;s also a card holder wallet,</text><text start="216.99" dur="2.67">which lets me put up to
four cards in the back</text><text start="219.66" dur="1.65">and then slap it on the back with magnets</text><text start="221.31" dur="1.71">and carry it around with me.</text><text start="223.02" dur="2.013">And there&amp;#39;s a lanyard,</text><text start="225.93" dur="1.32">not sure how many people</text><text start="227.25" dur="1.53">are gonna put their phone on a lanyard</text><text start="228.78" dur="2.55">but you now at least have the option to,</text><text start="231.33" dur="2.79">you can securely attach it
to the corner of the phone.</text><text start="234.12" dur="2.763">So is this a gimmick?</text><text start="238.08" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;m gonna vote no, I think
that kickstand is the one thing</text><text start="242.43" dur="1.98">that I would actually
want to have on my phone</text><text start="244.41" dur="2.34">or at least the option to have
on my phone whenever I want.</text><text start="246.75" dur="3.18">It&amp;#39;s kinda nice that that&amp;#39;s
available for it but in general,</text><text start="249.93" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s just the main point of it
is it&amp;#39;s one more useful thing</text><text start="253.44" dur="3.18">to separate it from
other phones at 200 bucks</text><text start="256.62" dur="1.02">in the design department.</text><text start="257.64" dur="2.85">I was gonna say, it feels kinda
like an ultra budget version</text><text start="260.49" dur="2.85">of MagSafe where instead
of having magnets,</text><text start="263.34" dur="2.94">you literally have to screw
the thing onto your phone.</text><text start="266.28" dur="3.54">But then I realized, wait,
this magnet accessory,</text><text start="269.82" dur="0.833">which is the plate</text><text start="270.653" dur="2.617">that you screw under the back
of your phone for the wallet,</text><text start="273.27" dur="3.06">connects with this
suspiciously familiar looking</text><text start="276.33" dur="2.1">ring of magnets in the middle.</text><text start="278.43" dur="3.33">So just for kicks, I slapped
a MagSafe mount on there</text><text start="281.76" dur="2.25">and it stuck like really well.</text><text start="284.01" dur="4.29">So I actually think if you
want to buy like a car mount</text><text start="288.3" dur="3.36">or some accessory to attach to this phone,</text><text start="291.66" dur="2.4">I actually think you
could buy a MagSafe one.</text><text start="294.06" dur="1.8">This is the Moment MagSafe puck</text><text start="295.86" dur="4.32">and it will hold the phone from the back,</text><text start="300.18" dur="1.32">so the more you know.</text><text start="301.5" dur="1.59">Now it obviously takes a bit of work;</text><text start="303.09" dur="2.25">several screws, the sim card ejector tool</text><text start="305.34" dur="1.29">and the twisting and all that</text><text start="306.63" dur="2.7">to take these accessories
off the back of the phone</text><text start="309.33" dur="1.56">and put a new one on,</text><text start="310.89" dur="3.48">so this isn&amp;#39;t something
you&amp;#39;d probably do every day</text><text start="314.37" dur="2.25">or multiple times per
day or anything like that</text><text start="316.62" dur="1.98">but it works.</text><text start="318.6" dur="1.17">You have the ability to.</text><text start="319.77" dur="1.74">And then when there&amp;#39;s nothing
on the back of the phone,</text><text start="321.51" dur="3.39">this dial actually kind of
protrudes the exact same amount</text><text start="324.9" dur="2.01">as the camera bump in the opposite corner,</text><text start="326.91" dur="2.91">so it prevents it from
rocking back and forth at all.</text><text start="329.82" dur="1.71">Well played, CMF, well played.</text><text start="331.53" dur="2.55">So they&amp;#39;ve got lots of neat
little hardware customizations</text><text start="334.08" dur="1.77">but the other important
thing about a phone</text><text start="335.85" dur="2.82">is what it&amp;#39;s actually like to use.</text><text start="338.67" dur="2.19">So I&amp;#39;ve been using the CMF Phone 1</text><text start="340.86" dur="3.81">for the better part of about
a week now and to be honest,</text><text start="344.67" dur="3.3">it feels just like I&amp;#39;m
using a Nothing phone,</text><text start="347.97" dur="0.93">which is a compliment.</text><text start="348.9" dur="3.54">Matter of fact, it&amp;#39;s literally
running Nothing OS 2.6</text><text start="352.44" dur="2.37">and aside from the light
up glyph interface,</text><text start="354.81" dur="2.16">it&amp;#39;s not missing a single feature</text><text start="356.97" dur="3.03">that the more premium
nothing phones actually have.</text><text start="360" dur="2.13">It&amp;#39;s got the cloned apps feature</text><text start="362.13" dur="1.53">where you can have more than one instance</text><text start="363.66" dur="1.86">of a single app installed.</text><text start="365.52" dur="1.08">It&amp;#39;s got Game Mode,</text><text start="366.6" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s got the clever little
one-handed pull down gesture</text><text start="370.05" dur="2.49">where you can pull down the
notifications without reaching.</text><text start="372.54" dur="1.68">And of course, all the aesthetics,</text><text start="374.22" dur="2.46">you know, the icon pack,
the home screen widgets,</text><text start="376.68" dur="2.28">the dots font, all that fun stuff.</text><text start="378.96" dur="2.28">You still have that
spot where you can view</text><text start="381.24" dur="3.27">all of your notification
history, underrated feature.</text><text start="384.51" dur="3.15">You know, it behaves exactly
like a Nothing phone.</text><text start="387.66" dur="1.8">And using this phone,</text><text start="389.46" dur="3.33">I can honestly say that
there were stretches of time</text><text start="392.79" dur="3.72">where I&amp;#39;d forget I was
using an ultra cheap phone.</text><text start="396.51" dur="2.73">Like it&amp;#39;s a fairly bright
responsive display,</text><text start="399.24" dur="2.1">it&amp;#39;s typically five to 700 nits,</text><text start="401.34" dur="3">but it&amp;#39;s an AMOLED that
peaks at 2,000 nits.</text><text start="404.34" dur="3.75">And it&amp;#39;s adaptive between 60 and 120hz</text><text start="408.09" dur="2.28">with a 240hz touch sample rate,</text><text start="410.37" dur="2.22">so it&amp;#39;s decently smooth and quick.</text><text start="412.59" dur="2.01">So just flipping around through</text><text start="414.6" dur="2.16">the daily inconsequential stuff</text><text start="416.76" dur="4.05">like scrolling through social
media or reading emails</text><text start="420.81" dur="1.59">or light web browsing,</text><text start="422.4" dur="1.47">for that stuff,</text><text start="423.87" dur="3.6">of course, this phone is
totally fine, super smooth.</text><text start="427.47" dur="1.26">The chip powering everything here</text><text start="428.73" dur="3.48">is the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 5G.</text><text start="432.21" dur="3.18">It&amp;#39;s about on par with
the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</text><text start="435.39" dur="1.2">as far as benchmarks</text><text start="436.59" dur="1.98">and they pair it with either
six or eight gigs of RAM,</text><text start="438.57" dur="1.11">depending on what spec you get,</text><text start="439.68" dur="2.79">it&amp;#39;s really decently well
equipped for 200 bucks.</text><text start="442.47" dur="1.92">But you can definitely get this phone</text><text start="444.39" dur="2.34">to show its price though,
like it&amp;#39;s not perfect.</text><text start="446.73" dur="1.35">These aren&amp;#39;t complaints,</text><text start="448.08" dur="2.79">these are just facts about the trade-offs</text><text start="450.87" dur="3">you obviously have to make to
get a phone to be this cheap.</text><text start="453.87" dur="2.97">So like this phone has a 5000mAh battery</text><text start="456.84" dur="1.59">and a really solid battery life,</text><text start="458.43" dur="2.04">but there&amp;#39;s no wireless charging</text><text start="460.47" dur="2.31">and of course, there&amp;#39;s no
charger included in the box.</text><text start="462.78" dur="2.85">If you&amp;#39;re wondering though,
it supports up to 33 watts.</text><text start="465.63" dur="2.61">But then this phone also has no NFC,</text><text start="468.24" dur="3.57">it has a really crappy
cheap vibration motor.</text><text start="471.81" dur="3.33">It has a single mono speaker
down here at the bottom</text><text start="475.14" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s surprisingly easy to
just block with one finger.</text><text start="479.1" dur="2.01">The optical under screen
fingerprint sensor,</text><text start="481.11" dur="1.29">I actually think that&amp;#39;s pretty impressive</text><text start="482.4" dur="0.87">for this price range</text><text start="483.27" dur="3.06">but it&amp;#39;s also been noticeably
on the slower side for me</text><text start="486.33" dur="3.63">and sometimes ask for multiple
reads before unlocking.</text><text start="489.96" dur="2.1">And then these plastic backs,</text><text start="492.06" dur="0.833">you know like I said,</text><text start="492.893" dur="1.297">they feel fine when they&amp;#39;re attached</text><text start="494.19" dur="2.82">to the frame of the phone,
but like a car bumper,</text><text start="497.01" dur="1.89">when they&amp;#39;re not attached to the frame,</text><text start="498.9" dur="2.22">you can really feel how flimsy they are.</text><text start="501.12" dur="3.33">These are plastic, the
buttons in here are,</text><text start="504.45" dur="3.27">they feel like they&amp;#39;re
literally held on by elastic</text><text start="507.72" dur="3">that I feel like I could
snap at any moment.</text><text start="510.72" dur="2.67">I mean, they haven&amp;#39;t yet but
they just look like they could.</text><text start="513.39" dur="1.5">And of course with removable backs,</text><text start="514.89" dur="2.16">the whole phone can&amp;#39;t be
super water resistant,</text><text start="517.05" dur="3.33">so it&amp;#39;s just IP 52 rated,
basically just good for a splash.</text><text start="520.38" dur="1.77">And we all know budget phone cameras</text><text start="522.15" dur="1.71">have never been anything special,</text><text start="523.86" dur="1.77">this phone is rocking a Sony sensor.</text><text start="525.63" dur="3">It&amp;#39;s a 50 megapixel primary
sensor for the camera</text><text start="528.63" dur="3.03">and it takes, I would
say, serviceable photos.</text><text start="531.66" dur="1.53">They&amp;#39;re not terrible, I would say.</text><text start="533.19" dur="3.45">You know, it&amp;#39;s an IMX882, so
it&amp;#39;s actually the same sensor</text><text start="536.64" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s in the POCO F6
and the Realme 12 Pro</text><text start="541.26" dur="1.89">and some other pretty budget phones,</text><text start="543.15" dur="2.13">and also the Moto Edge for some reason.</text><text start="545.28" dur="0.833">But anyway,</text><text start="546.113" dur="4.147">there&amp;#39;s also no OIS so when
the light starts going away,</text><text start="550.26" dur="1.35">it gets rough pretty quick.</text><text start="551.61" dur="2.283">And then that second sensor up at the top,</text><text start="555.6" dur="1.5">well, that&amp;#39;s not a camera at all,</text><text start="557.1" dur="3">that actually, it almost
never really does anything.</text><text start="560.1" dur="1.53">Turns out it&amp;#39;s just a depth sensor</text><text start="561.63" dur="3.87">for specifically shooting
2X Portrait Mode photos</text><text start="565.5" dur="3.18">to get a bit of a cleaner,
more accurate bokeh cutout.</text><text start="568.68" dur="3.21">But it didn&amp;#39;t also complain
much at all when I took photos</text><text start="571.89" dur="3.57">with it covered or anytime
while shooting actually.</text><text start="575.46" dur="2.37">So, hey, budget phones make sacrifices,</text><text start="577.83" dur="2.37">that&amp;#39;s not a new concept here</text><text start="580.2" dur="2.64">but I like the set of trade-offs</text><text start="582.84" dur="0.87">that they made with this one.</text><text start="583.71" dur="1.86">I mean, squinting back at it,</text><text start="585.57" dur="2.37">it doesn&amp;#39;t look bad for a $200 phone</text><text start="587.94" dur="1.98">and I think the set of
trade-offs that they made</text><text start="589.92" dur="4.623">in the name of really
good design and software,</text><text start="595.59" dur="0.833">I like it.</text><text start="596.423" dur="1.957">Now this phone is mainly
targeted towards India,</text><text start="598.38" dur="0.833">that&amp;#39;s the market</text><text start="599.213" dur="2.347">that it&amp;#39;s supposed to
be most competitive in,</text><text start="601.56" dur="3.42">and in that market, yeah,
there&amp;#39;s other cheap phones.</text><text start="604.98" dur="1.44">They&amp;#39;re a little more expensive than this</text><text start="606.42" dur="1.77">but they will also have</text><text start="608.19" dur="1.86">like the two years of software updates</text><text start="610.05" dur="1.74">and three years of security updates.</text><text start="611.79" dur="4.68">They will also have big screens
and relatively thin bezels</text><text start="616.47" dur="1.41">and MediaTek chips.</text><text start="617.88" dur="1.32">They&amp;#39;re usually not AMOLEDs though,</text><text start="619.2" dur="1.02">so that&amp;#39;s good about this one.</text><text start="620.22" dur="3.09">And a lot of &amp;#39;em will also
