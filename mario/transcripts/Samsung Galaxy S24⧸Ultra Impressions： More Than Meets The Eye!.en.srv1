<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.253" dur="2.177">(bright music)</text><text start="2.43" dur="1.8">- Yo, welcome to your first look</text><text start="4.23" dur="3.75">at the Samsung Galaxy S24 Series.</text><text start="7.98" dur="1.44">And I think they&amp;#39;re way more interesting</text><text start="9.42" dur="1.65">than they look on the outside.</text><text start="11.07" dur="1.11">So we got three new phones today:</text><text start="12.18" dur="4.02">Galaxy S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra.</text><text start="16.2" dur="2.507">And as expected, yes,
they look very similar</text><text start="18.707" dur="2.803">to the S23 lineup, especially design-wise,</text><text start="21.51" dur="1.59">but it&amp;#39;s when you get under the hood</text><text start="23.1" dur="4.62">and especially with software
and the whole Samsung AI thing,</text><text start="27.72" dur="1.29">that it gets way more interesting.</text><text start="29.01" dur="1.29">So first, let me start with everything</text><text start="30.3" dur="3">that&amp;#39;s physically new, &amp;#39;cause
the list actually isn&amp;#39;t long.</text><text start="33.3" dur="3.09">So on the outside, S24 and S24+ are going</text><text start="36.39" dur="1.89">to look just like last year,</text><text start="38.28" dur="2.19">same dimensions, same body sizes,</text><text start="40.47" dur="2.01">the camera rings, the button placement.</text><text start="42.48" dur="3.57">There&amp;#39;s just new colors:
black, gray, violet and yellow.</text><text start="46.05" dur="1.32">All matte instead of glossy,</text><text start="47.37" dur="1.59">which I was not expecting, but I like it.</text><text start="48.96" dur="4.05">And then it&amp;#39;s squared off,
basically exactly like an iPhone.</text><text start="53.01" dur="1.44">Now, I know, you know,
sometimes people say,</text><text start="54.45" dur="2.31">oh, there&amp;#39;s this feature that
kind of resembles the iPhone</text><text start="56.76" dur="1.17">or it looks a little like the iPhone.</text><text start="57.93" dur="2.04">No, these flat sides and the flat screen</text><text start="59.97" dur="3.48">look exactly like the
iPhone all the way around,</text><text start="63.45" dur="1.08">just being honest here,</text><text start="64.53" dur="2.7">but now inside that body,
the bezels are again,</text><text start="67.23" dur="1.65">slightly thinner all the way around,</text><text start="68.88" dur="4.05">making way for slightly larger
displays on S24 and S24+.</text><text start="72.93" dur="3.45">So now it&amp;#39;s 6.2 inches and 6.7 inches,</text><text start="76.38" dur="1.92">and then these panels
themselves are actually</text><text start="78.3" dur="2.4">sneaky major upgrades,
especially the bigger one.</text><text start="80.7" dur="4.95">So they&amp;#39;re both now a
ridiculously bright 2,600 nits,</text><text start="85.65" dur="4.17">and the Plus that got bumped
up from 1080 p to Quad HD,</text><text start="89.82" dur="2.28">and it looks like you do
have the option to use it</text><text start="92.1" dur="3.93">at 120 hertz while it is
Quad HD, just like the Ultra,</text><text start="96.03" dur="1.23">which I mean, that&amp;#39;s pretty sick.</text><text start="97.26" dur="2.55">It&amp;#39;s 1080 by default, but
that&amp;#39;s definitely an upgrade</text><text start="99.81" dur="1.8">they didn&amp;#39;t have to do
and I appreciate that.</text><text start="101.61" dur="2.55">And then the phones also have
slightly larger batteries,</text><text start="104.16" dur="2.91">both of &amp;#39;em, up to 4,000
milliamp hours on the S24</text><text start="107.07" dur="3">and 4,900 milliamp hours on the S24+.</text><text start="110.07" dur="1.02">And then the big dog,</text><text start="111.09" dur="2.97">the S24 Ultra is actually
even more tweaked.</text><text start="114.06" dur="2.4">So again, it looks similar, obviously,</text><text start="116.46" dur="1.95">but it&amp;#39;s trimmed up just a tiny bit.</text><text start="118.41" dur="1.32">It&amp;#39;s just a little bit thinner,</text><text start="119.73" dur="2.73">and then these side rails are now titanium</text><text start="122.46" dur="2.7">instead of aluminum,
whoever heard that before.</text><text start="125.16" dur="4.2">And the display up at the front
is now completely 100% flat</text><text start="129.36" dur="2.34">from corner to corner,
and I&amp;#39;m really liking it.</text><text start="131.7" dur="1.8">So you might remember we went from having</text><text start="133.5" dur="3.36">really dramatically curved
edges on the old Ultra phones</text><text start="136.86" dur="3.27">and Notes from back in the
day, to a gentle curve,</text><text start="140.13" dur="2.55">to almost no curve, but
now it&amp;#39;s no curve at all,</text><text start="142.68" dur="1.59">which means it&amp;#39;s totally flat,</text><text start="144.27" dur="2.58">and there&amp;#39;s actually much less
bezels all the way around.</text><text start="146.85" dur="1.26">And the screen goes to the very edges.</text><text start="148.11" dur="3.21">And then also the Ultra is
matte in all of its new colors,</text><text start="151.32" dur="2.67">black like usual, but a new titanium color</text><text start="153.99" dur="2.22">and a violet and yellow.</text><text start="156.21" dur="1.11">Then on the inside they&amp;#39;re all running</text><text start="157.32" dur="3.06">the new Snapdragon 8 Gen
3 chip across the board.</text><text start="160.38" dur="3.69">And then the cameras, the
cameras appear to be more or less</text><text start="164.07" dur="3.239">the same as last year
with the S24 and S24+,</text><text start="167.309" dur="3.871">but the S24 Ultra, they&amp;#39;ve
shook it up just a little bit.</text><text start="171.18" dur="1.17">So the Ultra phone we&amp;#39;ve gotten used</text><text start="172.35" dur="1.17">to having this space zoom.</text><text start="173.52" dur="1.86">So it was the 200 megapixel main camera,</text><text start="175.38" dur="3.57">but then it had two
telephotos: a 3x and a 10x.</text><text start="178.95" dur="1.77">But with this new S24 Ultra,</text><text start="180.72" dur="2.31">you still get the 200
megapixel main camera,</text><text start="183.03" dur="4.92">but then a 3x telephoto and
then a new 5x telephoto,</text><text start="187.95" dur="1.14">which is kind of curious,</text><text start="189.09" dur="2.19">but I actually think it makes sense here.</text><text start="191.28" dur="3.06">Basically the 10x is a huge jump of zoom</text><text start="194.34" dur="1.95">and I think Samsung is realizing not a lot</text><text start="196.29" dur="2.7">of people are actually zooming to 10x,</text><text start="198.99" dur="1.11">is just my theory anyway,</text><text start="200.1" dur="2.46">so instead of having a 10x telephoto lens,</text><text start="202.56" dur="1.98">which was only 10 megapixels,</text><text start="204.54" dur="4.41">this new redesigned 5x is 50 megapixels.</text><text start="208.95" dur="3.15">So the 5x, you know, that&amp;#39;s a
much more common zoom range,</text><text start="212.1" dur="2.43">and then the higher
megapixel count should mean</text><text start="214.53" dur="2.85">that when you hit the 10x
button that&amp;#39;s in the camera,</text><text start="217.38" dur="2.52">it crops into the middle 50% of the frame</text><text start="219.9" dur="2.49">and you should still have nearly
the same quality of a shot</text><text start="222.39" dur="2.52">as the old low-res 10x.</text><text start="224.91" dur="2.97">Now, this is all a theory, a lens theory,</text><text start="227.88" dur="1.53">but I&amp;#39;m gonna have to
test all this stuff out</text><text start="229.41" dur="1.71">and of course see how well
it works for the full review.</text><text start="231.12" dur="2.1">So definitely make sure you
get subscribed to see that</text><text start="233.22" dur="0.99">when it comes out.</text><text start="234.21" dur="0.833">Shout out to MatPat.</text><text start="235.043" dur="2.137">Now, other than that, it
feels like it&amp;#39;s pretty much</text><text start="237.18" dur="1.56">the same set of cameras across the board,</text><text start="238.74" dur="2.1">and the Ultra that also still has</text><text start="240.84" dur="1.86">a 5,000 milliamp-hour battery</text><text start="242.7" dur="2.55">with the S-Pen slotted
in the side as usual.</text><text start="245.25" dur="2.1">So if you want all the new
specs across the board,</text><text start="247.35" dur="1.71">here&amp;#39;s a nice little
chart we&amp;#39;ve made for you,</text><text start="249.06" dur="1.68">so you can pause and see the numbers</text><text start="250.74" dur="1.71">and the prices and everything.</text><text start="252.45" dur="3.93">I do wish to S24 started
at 256 gigs in 2024,</text><text start="256.38" dur="3.03">but anyway, we gotta talk about
this new chip for a minute.</text><text start="259.41" dur="1.17">So all these phones are running</text><text start="260.58" dur="2.94">the new Snapdragon 8 Gen
3 chip across the board,</text><text start="263.52" dur="3">great flagship chip,
beginning of its life cycle,</text><text start="266.52" dur="1.65">so you know, there&amp;#39;s a
couple phones trickling out</text><text start="268.17" dur="1.86">with this one now, and
there will be way more.</text><text start="270.03" dur="1.47">And of course I have to test things,</text><text start="271.5" dur="2.19">like the performance and the battery life</text><text start="273.69" dur="1.89">and how heating works out,</text><text start="275.58" dur="3.96">but it&amp;#39;s also very clear
that Qualcomm has built in</text><text start="279.54" dur="3.27">a bunch of AI processing
features into this chip.</text><text start="282.81" dur="3.15">And so now it&amp;#39;s up to the
manufacturers who use the chip</text><text start="285.96" dur="1.47">to decide what to do with it,</text><text start="287.43" dur="1.44">and so there&amp;#39;s phones
coming out left and right</text><text start="288.87" dur="2.28">with all kinds of AI features,</text><text start="291.15" dur="3.38">and I think a lot of &amp;#39;em are
actually the most useful parts</text><text start="294.53" dur="2.44">of some of these phones, and
let me know if you agree.</text><text start="296.97" dur="2.43">So the big one that I
think most people will find</text><text start="299.4" dur="4.14">the most useful on this phone
is the instant visual search.</text><text start="303.54" dur="1.62">So no matter where you are on the phone,</text><text start="305.16" dur="0.9">whatever you&amp;#39;re doing,</text><text start="306.06" dur="2.28">if you just hold down the home button,</text><text start="308.34" dur="2.16">or if you have gestures, just
hold down the gesture bar,</text><text start="310.5" dur="3.57">you can then either tap or
circle something on your screen</text><text start="314.07" dur="1.56">to instantly Google search it.</text><text start="315.63" dur="1.71">And it&amp;#39;s just, the few
times I played with it,</text><text start="317.34" dur="1.26">it&amp;#39;s really fast,</text><text start="318.6" dur="2.82">and this whole visual
search feature thing,</text><text start="321.42" dur="1.26">it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s totally new.</text><text start="322.68" dur="1.56">Like, we&amp;#39;ve had Reverse Image Search</text><text start="324.24" dur="3.42">and Google Lens for years,
but I&amp;#39;m loving the convenience</text><text start="327.66" dur="1.92">of just, you know, being on a website,</text><text start="329.58" dur="2.43">seeing an image or something
you just wanna know more about,</text><text start="332.01" dur="3">and then just long pressing,
Googling it real quick,</text><text start="335.01" dur="1.924">and getting the info.</text><text start="336.934" dur="0.896">Or even something in your gallery,</text><text start="337.83" dur="2.07">you know, maybe there&amp;#39;s a
landmark or something in a photo</text><text start="339.9" dur="2.07">and you just Google the image.</text><text start="341.97" dur="0.93">I mean I think it&amp;#39;s awesome.</text><text start="342.9" dur="2.28">I think people are gonna
be probably using it a lot.</text><text start="345.18" dur="1.77">It&amp;#39;s also just something you have to spend</text><text start="346.95" dur="1.08">a little time getting used to,</text><text start="348.03" dur="2.22">&amp;#39;cause everyone knows you
can type things into Google,</text><text start="350.25" dur="4.02">but to just visual search
Google stuff, super useful.</text><text start="354.27" dur="1.62">Then basically there&amp;#39;s a
bunch of other little places</text><text start="355.89" dur="2.49">in the phone where you
see the little stars,</text><text start="358.38" dur="1.77">the little barred stars.</text><text start="360.15" dur="3.69">If you see those, then you
know there&amp;#39;s some AI lurking</text><text start="363.84" dur="1.59">ready to help you out, just press it.</text><text start="365.43" dur="2.31">So the voice recorder app gets AI,</text><text start="367.74" dur="2.64">so now it does much
improved speaker labels</text><text start="370.38" dur="2.94">and transcriptions, and
it can actually summarize</text><text start="373.32" dur="1.89">your voice recording after you record</text><text start="375.21" dur="1.44">into a bunch of bullet points.</text><text start="376.65" dur="1.71">The Notes app gets AI.</text><text start="378.36" dur="2.37">Now it can do things like
straighten out your handwriting</text><text start="380.73" dur="2.94">or turn your notes into bullet points,</text><text start="383.67" dur="1.47">or summarize your notes.</text><text start="385.14" dur="2.25">It&amp;#39;s just, you gotta find those
little stars and press &amp;#39;em.</text><text start="387.39" dur="2.34">And the Galaxy S24 Ultra,
it feels like it becomes</text><text start="389.73" dur="1.95">more than just the ultimate
note-taking device,</text><text start="391.68" dur="2.01">but now it&amp;#39;s even more useful on top</text><text start="393.69" dur="3.45">of the already borderline
magical handwriting recognition</text><text start="397.14" dur="2.01">and all that stuff, so I love that.</text><text start="399.15" dur="2.4">The phone app gets AI.</text><text start="401.55" dur="1.5">So this stuff might
start to sound familiar,</text><text start="403.05" dur="2.31">but let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re gonna
have a phone call with someone</text><text start="405.36" dur="1.38">who speaks a different language.</text><text start="406.74" dur="4.17">It will do live
transcription and translation</text><text start="410.91" dur="2.67">audibly in real time as you&amp;#39;re
having the conversation.</text><text start="413.58" dur="1.74">So let&amp;#39;s say I only speak English</text><text start="415.32" dur="2.52">and you&amp;#39;re gonna call someone
who only speaks Korean,</text><text start="417.84" dur="1.32">so you have to go into the phone app</text><text start="419.16" dur="3">and download the language
pack before the call,</text><text start="422.16" dur="2.16">so it does all this transcription offline</text><text start="424.32" dur="2.13">with a model stored on the device,</text><text start="426.45" dur="1.38">and it seems like the
models are, you know,</text><text start="427.83" dur="2.07">somewhere from 100 to 500 megs each,</text><text start="429.9" dur="3.42">and when you get on the phone,
you just speak your language</text><text start="433.32" dur="2.67">and the phone will visually
and audibly translate</text><text start="435.99" dur="2.16">what you&amp;#39;re saying for the
person on the other end.</text><text start="438.15" dur="1.44">They hear their own language.</text><text start="439.59" dur="2.67">Then they speak their
language and the same thing.</text><text start="442.26" dur="2.07">You hear them, but then
you immediately hear</text><text start="444.33" dur="2.28">a translated version in your own language.</text><text start="446.61" dur="0.9">And it&amp;#39;s pretty fast.</text><text start="447.51" dur="3.45">I mean, I&amp;#39;ve never used live
translation this smooth before.</text><text start="450.96" dur="1.26">Now, I also don&amp;#39;t speak Korean,</text><text start="452.22" dur="1.98">so I&amp;#39;m not about to vouch
for how accurate it is,</text><text start="454.2" dur="1.89">but you know, I&amp;#39;m gonna
try this with Spanish</text><text start="456.09" dur="2.61">and try to verify a little
more when I review the phone,</text><text start="458.7" dur="2.73">but there&amp;#39;s even the
option to not even hear</text><text start="461.43" dur="3.75">the other person speak, but
just hear the translated voice,</text><text start="465.18" dur="1.47">which is bold, but it also speaks</text><text start="466.65" dur="1.38">to how accurate they think it is.</text><text start="468.03" dur="3.36">And then of course the photo app gets AI.</text><text start="471.39" dur="2.52">This one&amp;#39;s not a shocker, but
it&amp;#39;s also kind of shocking</text><text start="473.91" dur="3.45">how close it is to some other
things that we&amp;#39;ve seen before.</text><text start="477.36" dur="1.5">So once you have a photo,</text><text start="478.86" dur="2.49">you hit the info button with the stars,</text><text start="481.35" dur="1.77">and you can do a couple simple things</text><text start="483.12" dur="1.65">like add background blur</text><text start="484.77" dur="2.22">or erase an object in the background</text><text start="486.99" dur="2.73">or remaster a photo, which
seems like it&amp;#39;s just doing</text><text start="489.72" dur="2.79">some color and lighting and
balance tweaks automatically.</text><text start="492.51" dur="1.29">That&amp;#39;s cool. It works.</text><text start="493.8" dur="2.07">I think a lot of people will
just find that stuff useful</text><text start="495.87" dur="2.88">right off the bat, but once
you go into the editor,</text><text start="498.75" dur="1.98">you&amp;#39;ll see in the bottom left hand corner</text><text start="500.73" dur="2.46">a familiar group of stars that are back.</text><text start="503.19" dur="4.718">It&amp;#39;s literally a full on magic
editor, just like the Pixel.</text><text start="507.908" dur="3.262">(laughs) So you jump in
there, you can circle things,</text><text start="511.17" dur="1.56">highlight things to move around,</text><text start="512.73" dur="1.95">and of course it&amp;#39;s even
more precise with the S-Pen,</text><text start="514.68" dur="2.16">but then it literally does the same thing.</text><text start="516.84" dur="2.37">It takes a few seconds to
generate to fill the background,</text><text start="519.21" dur="2.49">it plays a nice little animation,
and then when it&amp;#39;s done,</text><text start="521.7" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s spits out a few
options of a new photo</text><text start="524.76" dur="2.73">that is just completely fake.</text><text start="527.49" dur="2.58">And also, I don&amp;#39;t know, there
seems to be less restrictions</text><text start="530.07" dur="1.71">with this one than Google&amp;#39;s, at least,</text><text start="531.78" dur="2.07">because I remember the
Pixel was very picky</text><text start="533.85" dur="1.8">about letting me move people around,</text><text start="535.65" dur="2.25">but I encountered nothing that this one</text><text start="537.9" dur="1.32">was not willing to mess with,</text><text start="539.22" dur="2.22">so the good thing is in the final result,</text><text start="541.44" dur="1.56">there is a baked in watermark</text><text start="543" dur="1.5">at the bottom left-hand corner.</text><text start="544.5" dur="2.28">So you&amp;#39;ll know in your gallery
if you&amp;#39;re looking at an image</text><text start="546.78" dur="1.86">that has those stars as a watermark,</text><text start="548.64" dur="2.37">that it didn&amp;#39;t actually look
like that when you captured it.</text><text start="551.01" dur="2.94">And you can also apparently
turn a regular video</text><text start="553.95" dur="5">into a slow motion video as
the AI generates new frames</text><text start="559.35" dur="2.16">in between actually captured frames,</text><text start="561.51" dur="1.44">and that can slow down the video for you.</text><text start="562.95" dur="1.32">I don&amp;#39;t know how well that&amp;#39;s gonna work.</text><text start="564.27" dur="1.05">Again, if it&amp;#39;s as good</text><text start="565.32" dur="2.19">as some of the generative
AI stuff I&amp;#39;ve seen,</text><text start="567.51" dur="1.53">could be shockingly good,</text><text start="569.04" dur="1.71">but that&amp;#39;s just another AI feature.</text><text start="570.75" dur="2.79">Either way, clearly
there&amp;#39;s a lot going on.</text><text start="573.54" dur="1.23">Now, it&amp;#39;s kind of funny.</text><text start="574.77" dur="3.584">Bixby (laughs) is like
sort of the main character</text><text start="578.354" dur="3.466">of AI on Samsung phones in the past,</text><text start="581.82" dur="2.7">and I don&amp;#39;t really see any
indication that Bixby itself</text><text start="584.52" dur="1.8">is actually taking big leaps forward.</text><text start="586.32" dur="0.99">It&amp;#39;s still on the phones.</text><text start="587.31" dur="1.95">It still works, but we&amp;#39;ll have to see.</text><text start="589.26" dur="0.833">I&amp;#39;m gonna test that.</text><text start="590.093" dur="1.627">I gotta test how good these screens are,</text><text start="591.72" dur="2.46">how well these new cameras
work, and all that stuff.</text><text start="594.18" dur="1.53">And maybe there&amp;#39;s some
other stuff buried in</text><text start="595.71" dur="1.32">that I haven&amp;#39;t found yet</text><text start="597.03" dur="2.73">that isn&amp;#39;t just blatantly
copying Apple&amp;#39;s homework.</text><text start="599.76" dur="1.68">And also, if you want your phone to look</text><text start="601.44" dur="1.23">at least a little different,</text><text start="602.67" dur="1.53">I checked with channel sponsor dbrand,</text><text start="604.2" dur="1.56">and they confirmed that
they&amp;#39;re ready to go</text><text start="605.76" dur="2.34">with the Grip Case shipping
around the same time</text><text start="608.1" dur="2.04">that Samsung will be
shipping out these phones.</text><text start="610.14" dur="1.32">One thing I&amp;#39;ve always
liked about the Grip Case</text><text start="611.46" dur="2.64">is they actually individually
do the precise cutouts</text><text start="614.1" dur="0.93">of the camera lenses</text><text start="615.03" dur="2.19">instead of just one
big lazy window cutout.</text><text start="617.22" dur="3.36">Oh and bonus, they added
MagSafe compatibility this year</text><text start="620.58" dur="1.2">for the S24 series.</text><text start="621.78" dur="2.34">So if you want a clean, protective,</text><text start="624.12" dur="2.34">matte black magnetic case,</text><text start="626.46" dur="1.32">well, that links in the description.</text><text start="627.78" dur="2.25">Either way, let me know what
you think of these new phones</text><text start="630.03" dur="2.236">and let me know what you
wanna see in the full review.</text><text start="632.266" dur="2.234">(smooth music)
Some interesting stuff here,</text><text start="634.5" dur="0.96">I&amp;#39;ll say that.</text><text start="635.46" dur="2.85">Thanks for watching,
catch you in the next one.</text><text start="638.31" dur="0.833">Peace.</text><text start="640.151" dur="2.859">(smooth music continues)</text></transcript>
