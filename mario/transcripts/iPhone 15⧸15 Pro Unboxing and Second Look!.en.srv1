<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.45" dur="2.61">- All right, so this is an iPhone 15</text><text start="3.06" dur="4.35">and a 15 Plus and a 15
Pro and a 15 Pro Max,</text><text start="7.41" dur="1.35">every new phone in the lineup.</text><text start="8.76" dur="2.97">New colors, new materials, new ports.</text><text start="11.73" dur="1.44">There&amp;#39;s some good stuff to unbox here,</text><text start="13.17" dur="1.62">so let&amp;#39;s do it.</text><text start="14.79" dur="2.58">So starting with iPhone 15 and 15 Plus.</text><text start="17.37" dur="5">This iPhone 15 here is the
new blue color, and it is,</text><text start="22.62" dur="0.833">I&amp;#39;m just gonna go ahead</text><text start="23.453" dur="2.227">and rename this color to barely blue.</text><text start="25.68" dur="1.14">I think that&amp;#39;s an appropriate name,</text><text start="26.82" dur="3.45">because it really is barely
giving hints of blue.</text><text start="30.27" dur="2.16">You can really see it
on the side rails too.</text><text start="32.43" dur="3.66">But yeah, really subtle colors
across the board this year.</text><text start="36.09" dur="2.31">Anyway, the other things in
the box are the paperwork,</text><text start="38.4" dur="2.16">the single white Apple sticker,</text><text start="40.56" dur="2.04">and there is no SIM card ejector tool here</text><text start="42.6" dur="2.31">since they&amp;#39;re all eSIM,
at least in the US now.</text><text start="44.91" dur="2.4">But most importantly, the
new cable in the iPhone box</text><text start="47.31" dur="1.83">for all new iPhones</text><text start="49.14" dur="4.53">is a single, white, braided
USB-C to USB-C cable.</text><text start="53.67" dur="1.2">I think this is the first time the iPhone</text><text start="54.87" dur="2.55">is shipping with a braided
nice cable like this.</text><text start="57.42" dur="1.62">So hopefully it&amp;#39;ll be a higher quality</text><text start="59.04" dur="1.92">and more durable than old cables</text><text start="60.96" dur="1.32">we&amp;#39;ve been getting for years.</text><text start="62.28" dur="2.91">So, cool, USB-C cable, USB-C phone.</text><text start="65.19" dur="1.74">Now, if we take a look at the Plus,</text><text start="66.93" dur="1.53">same idea, bigger box,</text><text start="68.46" dur="3">but this new incredibly pale yellow.</text><text start="71.46" dur="3">I mean, again, in perfect
lighting at the Apple event</text><text start="74.46" dur="1.47">I think it looked a
little bit more colorful,</text><text start="75.93" dur="2.52">but it just looks extremely pale out here.</text><text start="78.45" dur="3.27">And then we&amp;#39;ve got the Pro boxes
for the Pro phones as well.</text><text start="81.72" dur="2.49">Still white boxes, but dark wallpapers.</text><text start="84.21" dur="4.26">So the iPhone 15 Pro I have
here is the new dark blue color.</text><text start="88.47" dur="2.49">I almost want to call this
one barely blue again,</text><text start="90.96" dur="1.35">but this time it&amp;#39;s darker</text><text start="92.31" dur="1.44">and kind of borders on gray</text><text start="93.75" dur="1.56">when the light hits it
from certain angles.</text><text start="95.31" dur="0.833">Very safe.</text><text start="96.143" dur="1.507">Same stuff in the box after that though,</text><text start="97.65" dur="1.98">the paperwork, the white Apple sticker,</text><text start="99.63" dur="2.31">and the new braided USB-C cable.</text><text start="101.94" dur="2.19">And then our iPhone 15 Pro Max here</text><text start="104.13" dur="2.7">is the new Natural Titanium color.</text><text start="106.83" dur="2.07">And I gotta say, guys,</text><text start="108.9" dur="2.28">I think this is gonna be the one to get.</text><text start="111.18" dur="2.7">It&amp;#39;s the best color in person in the hand.</text><text start="113.88" dur="1.26">I&amp;#39;ll talk more about why in a minute,</text><text start="115.14" dur="1.5">but there you have it.</text><text start="116.64" dur="2.85">The slightly new unboxing experience</text><text start="119.49" dur="2.4">on iPhone 15s and 15 Pros.</text><text start="121.89" dur="1.2">So by the time you see this,</text><text start="123.09" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;ve been testing these
phones for about six days now.</text><text start="127.11" dur="2.34">Not quite enough time for
a review by my standards,</text><text start="129.45" dur="0.93">but still plenty of time</text><text start="130.38" dur="1.53">to give you some interesting thoughts,</text><text start="131.91" dur="2.52">some things that I&amp;#39;ve picked
up on, and some quirks.</text><text start="134.43" dur="2.28">So first of all, these pale colors.</text><text start="136.71" dur="1.11">I don&amp;#39;t really know how else to say it.</text><text start="137.82" dur="1.83">Like, this might be totally fine with you.</text><text start="139.65" dur="0.833">I always get told</text><text start="140.483" dur="1.417">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna put
a case on their phone,</text><text start="141.9" dur="1.26">which they probably are.</text><text start="143.16" dur="1.95">But hey, Apple did spend
a ton of time and money</text><text start="145.11" dur="3.39">making this new softer touch
satin finish on the back,</text><text start="148.5" dur="0.96">and some of us,</text><text start="149.46" dur="3.09">some of us will carry our
phones around with no case,</text><text start="152.55" dur="1.8">so it&amp;#39;s worth mentioning.</text><text start="154.35" dur="0.99">For the Pro phones</text><text start="155.34" dur="2.22">there&amp;#39;s actually an extra
layer of interesting though,</text><text start="157.56" dur="2.13">because they&amp;#39;ve switched
that rail material,</text><text start="159.69" dur="1.83">the part that you actually
touch on the outside,</text><text start="161.52" dur="3.93">from shiny stainless
steel to brushed titanium.</text><text start="165.45" dur="2.01">We&amp;#39;ve all heard about
how much lighter it is,</text><text start="167.46" dur="1.77">and it&amp;#39;s something like 10% lighter,</text><text start="169.23" dur="1.86">which is enough for me
to notice and enjoy.</text><text start="171.09" dur="2.25">But the other thing is I
thought the brushed finish</text><text start="173.34" dur="2.28">would sort of eliminate
fingerprints on the sides.</text><text start="175.62" dur="0.833">Absolutely not.</text><text start="176.453" dur="1.177">I was wrong about that.</text><text start="177.63" dur="0.833">I mean, it&amp;#39;s less,</text><text start="178.463" dur="1.357">it&amp;#39;s not as bad as stainless steel,</text><text start="179.82" dur="1.62">but especially on these darker colors</text><text start="181.44" dur="2.34">like the black or this blue,</text><text start="183.78" dur="1.65">you can totally see fingerprints</text><text start="185.43" dur="2.13">and sort of where your hand oils</text><text start="187.56" dur="2.22">are marking up the sides of the phone.</text><text start="189.78" dur="1.08">And then on top of that,</text><text start="190.86" dur="2.34">this is not anodized
like aluminum might be.</text><text start="193.2" dur="2.67">This is the new PVD coating
they talked about on stage.</text><text start="195.87" dur="1.77">And it&amp;#39;s only been a week here for me,</text><text start="197.64" dur="1.62">and so I don&amp;#39;t know exactly how well</text><text start="199.26" dur="1.32">this will hold up over time,</text><text start="200.58" dur="2.64">but what I do know is if you get a scratch</text><text start="203.22" dur="2.49">deep enough into this coating,</text><text start="205.71" dur="2.67">it&amp;#39;s gotta be the Natural
Titanium color underneath,</text><text start="208.38" dur="1.47">which is very light.</text><text start="209.85" dur="1.05">And so that might look rough,</text><text start="210.9" dur="1.92">if you drop this phone with no case</text><text start="212.82" dur="2.91">and get like a big gash
on your dark colored phone</text><text start="215.73" dur="1.56">and have light marks all over it.</text><text start="217.29" dur="1.14">All of that to say,</text><text start="218.43" dur="3.93">I do really think that this
Natural Titanium or the light</text><text start="222.36" dur="3.45">is gonna be the better color
to get on the Pros this year.</text><text start="225.81" dur="2.01">Okay, some things I&amp;#39;ve
noticed in my first week.</text><text start="227.82" dur="1.53">So first of all, on the Pro,</text><text start="229.35" dur="2.01">the bezels are technically
a little bit thinner,</text><text start="231.36" dur="2.04">which makes the body a little smaller,</text><text start="233.4" dur="2.37">but you really don&amp;#39;t notice
that much after a few minutes.</text><text start="235.77" dur="2.1">What you do notice more actually visually</text><text start="237.87" dur="1.77">is the slightly softer curves</text><text start="239.64" dur="1.2">all the way around these phones,</text><text start="240.84" dur="1.86">seriously, on the 15 and 15 Pro.</text><text start="242.7" dur="2.49">Because on the 14 it was so square,</text><text start="245.19" dur="2.91">like it just went straight to
the edge with a flat display</text><text start="248.1" dur="2.58">and then it dropped right
into the rail at 90 degrees.</text><text start="250.68" dur="0.99">On these new phones,</text><text start="251.67" dur="1.47">the edge of the front glass</text><text start="253.14" dur="2.55">actually has a little bit
of curve at the very edges,</text><text start="255.69" dur="2.13">so it&amp;#39;s a softer curve into the rail.</text><text start="257.82" dur="2.19">Then the rail itself has softer curves</text><text start="260.01" dur="2.52">than the totally sharp
corners from last year.</text><text start="262.53" dur="1.2">So I think it&amp;#39;s a nice hybrid</text><text start="263.73" dur="1.71">of making it just more comfortable</text><text start="265.44" dur="1.08">in the hand with these curves,</text><text start="266.52" dur="2.25">but still keeping the generally boxy look.</text><text start="268.77" dur="1.71">Now, with USB-C on these phones,</text><text start="270.48" dur="2.46">we already learned that you
can just plug in a cable</text><text start="272.94" dur="1.62">to charge an accessory, right?</text><text start="274.56" dur="2.25">So it&amp;#39;s no reverse wireless charging,</text><text start="276.81" dur="2.1">but you can at least plug in a USB-C cable</text><text start="278.91" dur="1.98">straight to AirPods</text><text start="280.89" dur="1.98">or an Apple Watch MagSafe
charger, whatever,</text><text start="282.87" dur="2.1">and it will charge from
your phone&amp;#39;s battery.</text><text start="284.97" dur="1.68">So that&amp;#39;s already pretty interesting,</text><text start="286.65" dur="1.65">but I decided it&amp;#39;s worth learning</text><text start="288.3" dur="1.59">all the rules and behaviors</text><text start="289.89" dur="2.73">of plugging things into the iPhone 15s.</text><text start="292.62" dur="0.833">So here they are.</text><text start="293.453" dur="3.547">So if you plug in any
older Lightning iPhone</text><text start="297" dur="1.47">into a USB-C iPhone,</text><text start="298.47" dur="1.56">regardless of the charge state,</text><text start="300.03" dur="2.97">the USB-C iPhone will always give battery</text><text start="303" dur="1.38">to the Lightning iPhone,</text><text start="304.38" dur="2.4">every single time no matter what.</text><text start="306.78" dur="2.73">Now, if you plug in another USB-C iPhone</text><text start="309.51" dur="2.04">into your USB-C iPhone,</text><text start="311.55" dur="2.34">it actually does a handshake
where they talk to each other,</text><text start="313.89" dur="2.37">figure out which one
has the lower battery,</text><text start="316.26" dur="2.257">and then the one with the
higher state of charge goes,</text><text start="318.517" dur="1.493">&amp;quot;All right, I&amp;#39;m a battery bank,</text><text start="320.01" dur="1.59">and I will start charging the one</text><text start="321.6" dur="1.44">with the lower stated of charge,&amp;quot;</text><text start="323.04" dur="1.29">all the way till you unplug it.</text><text start="324.33" dur="1.23">So I thought that was pretty interesting</text><text start="325.56" dur="1.2">and it works pretty well.</text><text start="326.76" dur="3.18">Then I decided to try a
couple of Android phones</text><text start="329.94" dur="2.19">and see if the same handshake happened.</text><text start="332.13" dur="1.23">Basically what we found</text><text start="333.36" dur="2.64">is if you plug into your
friend&amp;#39;s Android phone</text><text start="336" dur="1.56">who has more battery than you</text><text start="337.56" dur="2.28">and that phone has USB PD,</text><text start="339.84" dur="2.04">it will actually act like a battery bank.</text><text start="341.88" dur="2.1">But if the phone doesn&amp;#39;t have USB PD,</text><text start="343.98" dur="2.37">which is a bunch actually right now,</text><text start="346.35" dur="1.05">it&amp;#39;s pretty inconsistent</text><text start="347.4" dur="1.23">and you could end up charging it</text><text start="348.63" dur="1.74">or it could end up charging you.</text><text start="350.37" dur="1.95">Literally unplug and try it again.</text><text start="352.32" dur="2.16">But if it has USB Power Delivery,</text><text start="354.48" dur="2.43">it will actually do the same
handshake that the iPhones do.</text><text start="356.91" dur="1.62">It&amp;#39;s only 4 1/2 watts out,</text><text start="358.53" dur="0.9">so it&amp;#39;s not huge.</text><text start="359.43" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s not gonna fast charge or anything.</text><text start="361.11" dur="2.22">But, you know, it is
ideal for accessories.</text><text start="363.33" dur="1.8">You can literally use the cable in the box</text><text start="365.13" dur="2.19">to charge up the new AirPods</text><text start="367.32" dur="1.56">or whatever else you wanna try.</text><text start="368.88" dur="3.21">But yeah, you can rescue
another smartphone in a pinch.</text><text start="372.09" dur="3.24">So then the new Action button on the Pros.</text><text start="375.33" dur="1.2">I was very curious about this.</text><text start="376.53" dur="2.37">I was not sure if it would
have some restrictions</text><text start="378.9" dur="2.49">or if there&amp;#39;s some things
that it wouldn&amp;#39;t let you do,</text><text start="381.39" dur="3.75">and it turns out I haven&amp;#39;t
been able to find any so far.</text><text start="385.14" dur="2.28">It seems like it basically
lets you do anything you want,</text><text start="387.42" dur="1.38">and I&amp;#39;m very happy about that.</text><text start="388.8" dur="1.11">I mean, this was a feature</text><text start="389.91" dur="1.98">of a lot of Android phones in the past.</text><text start="391.89" dur="1.71">There were some LG phones that did this,</text><text start="393.6" dur="2.79">some Sony phones, I wanna
say some ASUS phones.</text><text start="396.39" dur="1.92">I&amp;#39;m hoping it starts to make
a bit of a comeback here,</text><text start="398.31" dur="2.91">because on this new iPhone it is great.</text><text start="401.22" dur="1.35">So you jump into the settings</text><text start="402.57" dur="1.74">and go to Action button,</text><text start="404.31" dur="2.25">and it loads up this whole crazy UI</text><text start="406.56" dur="2.94">that&amp;#39;s just nothing like any
of the other settings pages</text><text start="409.5" dur="0.833">on the iPhone,</text><text start="410.333" dur="3.067">like they just stapled
this in here, but okay.</text><text start="413.4" dur="1.71">And as I showed you in
the impressions video,</text><text start="415.11" dur="0.84">you can do any number</text><text start="415.95" dur="2.01">of pre-programmed things with this button.</text><text start="417.96" dur="3.06">By default, it is still the
mute switch that it replaces,</text><text start="421.02" dur="2.04">and it has those two
different haptic patterns.</text><text start="423.06" dur="1.5">So when you mute it in your pocket,</text><text start="424.56" dur="1.17">you know exactly what you&amp;#39;re doing</text><text start="425.73" dur="1.89">without even checking
you did it correctly.</text><text start="427.62" dur="1.17">But honestly, I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="428.79" dur="2.16">I leave my phone on mute
most of the time anyway.</text><text start="430.95" dur="2.22">So you can also have it open up the camera</text><text start="433.17" dur="1.32">in any of the camera modes.</text><text start="434.49" dur="1.74">But then again, the camera shortcut</text><text start="436.23" dur="1.65">is, like, right on your
lock screen already,</text><text start="437.88" dur="1.59">and I&amp;#39;m pretty used to that.</text><text start="439.47" dur="1.11">Same thing with the flashlight.</text><text start="440.58" dur="0.833">You could do that,</text><text start="441.413" dur="2.917">but it&amp;#39;s also already on
everyone&amp;#39;s lock screen.</text><text start="444.33" dur="1.2">I like the voice memo trigger.</text><text start="445.53" dur="0.96">It&amp;#39;s actually pretty convenient</text><text start="446.49" dur="2.04">because it immediately starts recording</text><text start="448.53" dur="1.26">when you press and hold the button.</text><text start="449.79" dur="4.41">But my favorite by a mile is
the Siri Shortcuts function</text><text start="454.2" dur="2.46">because it basically lets
you do anything else.</text><text start="456.66" dur="2.49">You can stack up a bunch
of different functions</text><text start="459.15" dur="1.83">that are, like, location dependent,</text><text start="460.98" dur="2.67">or you can have it call a certain contact</text><text start="463.65" dur="1.2">or do certain things,</text><text start="464.85" dur="1.74">or if you just wanna literally open</text><text start="466.59" dur="2.1">any app on your phone with zero lag.</text><text start="468.69" dur="2.52">So it could be your to-do
list app or your calendar app</text><text start="471.21" dur="3.03">or just open YouTube with
any one button press.</text><text start="474.24" dur="0.9">Whatever you want.</text><text start="475.14" dur="3.27">For me, I&amp;#39;m gonna map my Action button</text><text start="478.41" dur="3.81">on my brand new iPhone
to the Google Assistant,</text><text start="482.22" dur="2.55">the best assistant
available on the iPhone.</text><text start="484.77" dur="2.1">Also, Apple, if you&amp;#39;re listening,</text><text start="486.87" dur="2.82">I also wish you could map a double press</text><text start="489.69" dur="2.64">or a triple press of the Action button</text><text start="492.33" dur="2.163">to a new specific function.</text><text start="495.48" dur="1.14">Just think about it.</text><text start="496.62" dur="0.84">Also, I was kind of curious</text><text start="497.46" dur="2.04">how cases would handle
this new Action button.</text><text start="499.5" dur="1.35">So I asked channel sponsor dbrand</text><text start="500.85" dur="1.68">to send over their new Ghost case,</text><text start="502.53" dur="0.833">and I have it here.</text><text start="503.363" dur="1.537">Personally, pretty solid.</text><text start="504.9" dur="2.37">I think this matte black
skeleton design looks sick.</text><text start="507.27" dur="2.4">And yes, I can confirm
that even with the case,</text><text start="509.67" dur="2.25">the Action button still
feels nice and clicky.</text><text start="511.92" dur="0.833">Now, I might be thinking,</text><text start="512.753" dur="2.617">all right, what&amp;#39;s so special
about this clear case?</text><text start="515.37" dur="1.44">I&amp;#39;ve seen a million clear cases.</text><text start="516.81" dur="1.56">And between the skeleton and MagSafe,</text><text start="518.37" dur="0.96">there&amp;#39;s a bunch of other stuff,</text><text start="519.33" dur="1.56">but my favorite personally</text><text start="520.89" dur="1.92">is if you&amp;#39;ve ever owned
a clear case before,</text><text start="522.81" dur="1.41">you probably know that after a while</text><text start="524.22" dur="2.55">it kind of ends up looking like this,</text><text start="526.77" dur="1.35">which is disgusting and yellow.</text><text start="528.12" dur="1.2">But dbrand has promised me</text><text start="529.32" dur="2.64">that they&amp;#39;ve specifically
engineered the Ghost case</text><text start="531.96" dur="2.163">to be impossible to yellow,</text><text start="535.08" dur="1.47">and they use those words themselves.</text><text start="536.55" dur="1.59">So they actually give you</text><text start="538.14" dur="3.66">a lifetime case replacement
guarantee if it every yellows.</text><text start="541.8" dur="3.12">So that&amp;#39;s either a real promise</text><text start="544.92" dur="2.67">or free cases for life, the way I see it.</text><text start="547.59" dur="0.96">Either way, if you&amp;#39;re interested,</text><text start="548.55" dur="0.99">I&amp;#39;ll leave a link below the like button</text><text start="549.54" dur="0.93">if you wanna check it out.</text><text start="550.47" dur="1.17">That&amp;#39;s the dbrand Ghost case.</text><text start="551.64" dur="1.77">Now, I&amp;#39;ve also been taking
some pictures and videos</text><text start="553.41" dur="0.87">with these new cameras</text><text start="554.28" dur="1.56">to get a sense of how they perform.</text><text start="555.84" dur="1.41">I will be taking many, many more,</text><text start="557.25" dur="2.61">posting them on on Twitter
if you wanna follow me there.</text><text start="559.86" dur="1.26">Instagram as well.</text><text start="561.12" dur="1.38">I also fully plan on shooting</text><text start="562.5" dur="2.82">the next Auto Focus car
channel video with this phone,</text><text start="565.32" dur="2.01">so you already know you
can go subscribe over there</text><text start="567.33" dur="1.38">to see how the video looks,</text><text start="568.71" dur="1.5">to hear how the microphones sound.</text><text start="570.21" dur="2.31">One thing that they did mention
in the keynote specifically</text><text start="572.52" dur="2.37">was there was a new
coating over the lenses</text><text start="574.89" dur="1.77">that I immediately thought,</text><text start="576.66" dur="3.75">oh, does this fix the horrible
nighttime flare issues</text><text start="580.41" dur="1.77">with the iPhone&amp;#39;s video?</text><text start="582.18" dur="1.8">First thing I did was go to a dark room,</text><text start="583.98" dur="2.16">bring it out at night,
shoot with some lights.</text><text start="586.14" dur="2.61">No, it didn&amp;#39;t fix it, unfortunately.</text><text start="588.75" dur="0.833">I&amp;#39;m sure the coating</text><text start="589.583" dur="1.447">does some other great
stuff during the daytime,</text><text start="591.03" dur="2.37">but there&amp;#39;s still flare issues, sadly.</text><text start="593.4" dur="0.833">But also, lastly,</text><text start="594.233" dur="3.187">I wanna clarify the new camera
behavior on the Pro phones.</text><text start="597.42" dur="0.99">In the impressions video,</text><text start="598.41" dur="1.435">I was a little down on the whole, like,</text><text start="599.845" dur="3.545">1x versus 1.2x versus 1.5x thing,</text><text start="603.39" dur="2.4">because I thought it was
literally just a digital crop,</text><text start="605.79" dur="2.19">which would be pretty pointless to me.</text><text start="607.98" dur="3.6">But it&amp;#39;s actually closer to a
set of Super Res Zoom presets</text><text start="611.58" dur="2.49">that you can actually then
digitally zoom between.</text><text start="614.07" dur="2.34">I&amp;#39;ll detail all of this
in the full reviews.</text><text start="616.41" dur="2.64">And here&amp;#39;s some benchmark scores</text><text start="619.05" dur="1.56">in case you&amp;#39;re curious
about that sort of thing</text><text start="620.61" dur="1.77">for performance for the A17 Pro,</text><text start="622.38" dur="1.71">which is actually new.</text><text start="624.09" dur="1.71">But generally, I think that wraps up</text><text start="625.8" dur="2.04">my first, second impressions,</text><text start="627.84" dur="2.49">my second look now that
I got &amp;#39;em in the studio.</text><text start="630.33" dur="3.39">Really I feel like the base iPhone 15s,</text><text start="633.72" dur="2.35">if you wanna buy one of
these or pre-order &amp;#39;em,</text><text start="636.99" dur="3.27">it&amp;#39;s a bigger improvement
than it seems on paper.</text><text start="640.26" dur="2.61">Like, nothing is actually new here,</text><text start="642.87" dur="3.75">but because it&amp;#39;s bringing things
from last year&amp;#39;s Pro phone,</text><text start="646.62" dur="1.68">it&amp;#39;s actually a very solid phone.</text><text start="648.3" dur="3.21">And then the Pro, it&amp;#39;s
a lot more interesting</text><text start="651.51" dur="2.52">because there&amp;#39;s some
genuinely new stuff happening.</text><text start="654.03" dur="2.01">I&amp;#39;ve seen new stuff with the cameras.</text><text start="656.04" dur="2.01">Also, it seems like someone found out</text><text start="658.05" dur="1.92">the batteries are slightly
bigger across the board,</text><text start="659.97" dur="0.9">which is good too.</text><text start="660.87" dur="1.8">We&amp;#39;ll see if that holds up.</text><text start="662.67" dur="0.87">But generally, let me know</text><text start="663.54" dur="1.97">what you wanna see in the full reviews</text><text start="665.51" dur="1.09">in the comment section below,</text><text start="666.6" dur="1.71">because I will be working on those</text><text start="668.31" dur="1.59">over the next couple days and weeks,</text><text start="669.9" dur="2.19">and hopefully you&amp;#39;ll see that soon.</text><text start="672.09" dur="2.1">Either way, thanks for watching.</text><text start="674.19" dur="0.833">Catch you in the next one.</text><text start="675.023" dur="0.833">Peace.</text><text start="676.741" dur="3.5">(mellow electronic music)</text></transcript>
