<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.061" dur="3.083">(light upbeat music)</text><text start="8.91" dur="3.57">- So you remember like a
year ago, when Dyson came out</text><text start="12.48" dur="2.13">with these things,</text><text start="14.61" dur="2.31">the Dyson Headphones Combo</text><text start="16.92" dur="3.24">Wearable Air Purifier nightmare gadget.</text><text start="20.16" dur="3.51">I tested them, I reviewed
them, I gave it a chance,</text><text start="23.67" dur="2.58">it ended up still being
the single dumbest product</text><text start="26.25" dur="0.9">I&amp;#39;ve ever reviewed.</text><text start="27.15" dur="0.833">Still is.</text><text start="27.983" dur="2.617">So imagine my surprise when
Dyson unveils a new product</text><text start="30.6" dur="3.9">a year later and it&amp;#39;s just headphones.</text><text start="34.5" dur="3.24">It&amp;#39;s just like they removed
the stupid air purifier part</text><text start="37.74" dur="4.68">and left behind the giant
metal pair of Dyson headphones</text><text start="42.42" dur="3.21">that were kind of overshadowed last time.</text><text start="45.63" dur="3.33">This is them and they are $500.</text><text start="48.96" dur="2.64">So yeah, of course I&amp;#39;m
gonna give them a shot,</text><text start="51.6" dur="1.23">because, you know, on the off chance</text><text start="52.83" dur="1.86">that someone out there was turned off</text><text start="54.69" dur="2.04">by the super spreader air filter thing,</text><text start="56.73" dur="2.04">but was still intrigued by the idea</text><text start="58.77" dur="2.19">of a pair of super high-end Dyson</text><text start="60.96" dur="1.44">active noise canceling headphones.</text><text start="62.4" dur="1.65">I&amp;#39;m dedicated to giving you a fair shake.</text><text start="64.05" dur="4.32">And the thing is, it might
not seem to make much sense</text><text start="68.37" dur="4.47">until you consider that
AirPods Max also exist.</text><text start="72.84" dur="1.74">In fact, the more you compare them,</text><text start="74.58" dur="3.09">the more it feels like
Dyson just saw AirPods Max</text><text start="77.67" dur="2.22">just getting dusty sitting in the corner,</text><text start="79.89" dur="3.69">no updates after four years,
still has a lightning port,</text><text start="83.58" dur="2.79">still super heavy, just unchanged</text><text start="86.37" dur="4.05">and still getting sales at $550,</text><text start="90.42" dur="2.31">and thought, &amp;quot;Okay, well,</text><text start="92.73" dur="2.79">surely that audience is looking
for an alternative, right?&amp;quot;</text><text start="95.52" dur="1.32">And when you put them side by side,</text><text start="96.84" dur="2.04">it becomes actually
pretty clear to me that</text><text start="98.88" dur="1.98">what Dyson seems to have done is aimed</text><text start="100.86" dur="2.97">to basically one up Apple&amp;#39;s
headphones in as many ways</text><text start="103.83" dur="1.8">as they possibly could, while still being</text><text start="105.63" dur="1.8">in the same exact category</text><text start="107.43" dur="3.57">of huge heavy noise-canceling headphones.</text><text start="111" dur="3.57">So like I said, these
things retail at 500 bucks,</text><text start="114.57" dur="1.95">but that is 50 bucks cheaper than Apple&amp;#39;s.</text><text start="116.52" dur="2.58">It has replaceable ear
cups for 50 bucks a piece.</text><text start="119.1" dur="2.28">Believe it or not, that
also undercuts Apple.</text><text start="121.38" dur="2.82">The rated battery life is 55 hours,</text><text start="124.2" dur="1.71">which is just dramatically better,</text><text start="125.91" dur="2.64">more than doubles,
AirPods Max is 20 hours.</text><text start="128.55" dur="1.89">Also Dyson&amp;#39;s headphones work the same</text><text start="130.44" dur="2.01">on both iPhone and Android.</text><text start="132.45" dur="3.39">And of course, these also
have a real off button.</text><text start="135.84" dur="2.25">So, yeah.</text><text start="138.09" dur="1.83">But anyway, I think I have
to start with the fact</text><text start="139.92" dur="5">that these headphones are somehow
heavier even than Apple&amp;#39;s.</text><text start="144.96" dur="2.58">These are the heaviest
headphones I&amp;#39;ve ever tested.</text><text start="147.54" dur="4.89">451 grams, which is not great on paper.</text><text start="152.43" dur="2.73">But the thing that they at
least do well is they kind of,</text><text start="155.16" dur="2.22">they distribute it well across your head.</text><text start="157.38" dur="2.73">Now everything on these
headphones is metal,</text><text start="160.11" dur="4.23">like not just the ear cups but
also the hinges, the top band</text><text start="164.34" dur="3.54">and then basically just this
top cushion is super soft.</text><text start="167.88" dur="2.85">The left and right ones
actually aren&amp;#39;t super soft,</text><text start="170.73" dur="0.99">even though they look the same.</text><text start="171.72" dur="2.13">And that&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;ve
put batteries in here.</text><text start="173.85" dur="3.51">So the weight now is actually
higher off of the ear cups,</text><text start="177.36" dur="1.77">which is how they managed to be,</text><text start="179.13" dur="2.76">I&amp;#39;d say, just as
comfortable as AirPods Max.</text><text start="181.89" dur="1.86">They feel different, but,
you know, not a high bar.</text><text start="183.75" dur="1.08">They&amp;#39;re still super heavy.</text><text start="184.83" dur="3.69">It&amp;#39;s just they&amp;#39;re not super
uncomfortable for sitting around</text><text start="188.52" dur="1.95">and passively listening for a while.</text><text start="190.47" dur="2.28">And honestly, there&amp;#39;s
actually a lot of interesting,</text><text start="192.75" dur="2.22">sometimes clever design
with these headphones.</text><text start="194.97" dur="3.18">The main one really being these
interchangeable back plates</text><text start="198.15" dur="1.05">and ear cushions.</text><text start="199.2" dur="1.65">I&amp;#39;ll get to how they sound, don&amp;#39;t worry.</text><text start="200.85" dur="4.65">But these ear cups are a
quarter twist and an unlock away</text><text start="205.5" dur="2.55">from being totally replaceable.</text><text start="208.05" dur="3.96">And then these back
material is, it&amp;#39;s just a cap</text><text start="212.01" dur="3.12">that is also a quarter twist away</text><text start="215.13" dur="2.01">from being totally replaceable as well.</text><text start="217.14" dur="2.94">So they can both be replaced
with different colors</text><text start="220.08" dur="2.7">and then you can mix and
match different combos</text><text start="222.78" dur="1.74">of ear cups and back plates.</text><text start="224.52" dur="1.29">Now you don&amp;#39;t actually get</text><text start="225.81" dur="1.95">like a bunch of these with the headphones.</text><text start="227.76" dur="1.8">Like I said, they&amp;#39;re 50 bucks a pair.</text><text start="229.56" dur="1.89">So basically when you go to their website,</text><text start="231.45" dur="3.24">you choose between these
four base color combos</text><text start="234.69" dur="1.35">and I&amp;#39;d say choose wisely,</text><text start="236.04" dur="2.73">because then any extras you
want, you gotta pay for.</text><text start="238.77" dur="2.31">So you might&amp;#39;ve seen what people
were doing a few years ago</text><text start="241.08" dur="1.11">with like mixing and matching</text><text start="242.19" dur="2.07">different ear cup colors with AirPods Max.</text><text start="244.26" dur="2.31">Dyson basically, I think, saw this</text><text start="246.57" dur="2.587">but took it to the next
logical level and just said,</text><text start="249.157" dur="2.453">&amp;quot;All right, we&amp;#39;ll build
it right in as a feature</text><text start="251.61" dur="1.11">and upsell you.&amp;quot;</text><text start="252.72" dur="2.1">And it&amp;#39;s fine, it works.</text><text start="254.82" dur="1.44">Is it a bit of a gimmick?</text><text start="256.26" dur="1.59">Kinda. Yeah, sure.</text><text start="257.85" dur="2.28">But you can also tell
they put in real work</text><text start="260.13" dur="2.22">with the lock-and-twist mechanisms,</text><text start="262.35" dur="1.68">so they don&amp;#39;t come off easily.</text><text start="264.03" dur="2.91">But you can also always
unlock and swap out a new cap</text><text start="266.94" dur="2.07">which have lots of different
finishes, by the way.</text><text start="269.01" dur="0.87">There&amp;#39;s the aluminum one,</text><text start="269.88" dur="1.41">which is really shiny and metallic,</text><text start="271.29" dur="2.76">but the colored ones
have like a matte finish.</text><text start="274.05" dur="1.92">They almost look like a ColorWear collab.</text><text start="275.97" dur="1.5">Another clever little design thing,</text><text start="277.47" dur="3.99">and this actually comes from
the previous Tyson headphones,</text><text start="281.46" dur="1.98">is this clever little
joystick on the back,</text><text start="283.44" dur="1.14">on the back right hand side.</text><text start="284.58" dur="3.18">This is almost all of
the physical controls</text><text start="287.76" dur="1.62">for these headphones, and it&amp;#39;s great,</text><text start="289.38" dur="1.5">because it has a bunch of functionality.</text><text start="290.88" dur="2.19">You can press in to play pause,</text><text start="293.07" dur="2.37">you can go up or down for volume,</text><text start="295.44" dur="2.34">left or right, moves you through tracks,</text><text start="297.78" dur="2.22">and it sticks out, so
it&amp;#39;s easy to find blind,</text><text start="300" dur="0.96">you don&amp;#39;t even have to see it.</text><text start="300.96" dur="2.37">Then the only other physical control is</text><text start="303.33" dur="1.89">double tapping the left ear cup</text><text start="305.22" dur="3.3">to turn on and off noise
cancellation or transparency mode.</text><text start="308.52" dur="3.93">Unfortunately, this control
is extremely finicky</text><text start="312.45" dur="3.51">and only works like 50% of the time,</text><text start="315.96" dur="2.94">which sounds insane, until you realize</text><text start="318.9" dur="3.69">this is not a touch surface,</text><text start="322.59" dur="2.94">it&amp;#39;s just a cap on top of the headphones.</text><text start="325.53" dur="2.58">So I imagine it&amp;#39;s some
sort of like force sensor,</text><text start="328.11" dur="3.42">so you like really have
to smack the headphones</text><text start="331.53" dur="1.53">to change it.</text><text start="333.06" dur="0.96">Yeah, that&amp;#39;s not great.</text><text start="334.02" dur="2.07">But a couple other small observations,</text><text start="336.09" dur="4.8">the chime that plays when
you first put them on</text><text start="340.89" dur="2.19">is super loud every time.</text><text start="343.08" dur="2.85">I don&amp;#39;t know why. Please turn that down.</text><text start="345.93" dur="2.97">But then these headphones also
only twist in one direction,</text><text start="348.9" dur="4.08">so that way that&amp;#39;s how
you get them to fold flat.</text><text start="352.98" dur="4.02">Although, they don&amp;#39;t
actually totally fold at all.</text><text start="357" dur="5">So to bring them with you, you
need this. This is the case.</text><text start="362.97" dur="1.5">I mean I guess you don&amp;#39;t need this case,</text><text start="364.47" dur="1.38">but this is the one it comes with.</text><text start="365.85" dur="3.87">This is it&amp;#39;s basically
two flat boards of silicon</text><text start="369.72" dur="2.13">connected by some elastic,</text><text start="371.85" dur="1.89">and you kinda just push the
headphones down right in there.</text><text start="373.74" dur="1.53">You do have to shrink
them down a little bit.</text><text start="375.27" dur="1.59">And there is one pocket near the top</text><text start="376.86" dur="2.4">for any cables you wanna take with you.</text><text start="379.26" dur="1.32">Sure, that&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="380.58" dur="1.89">These headphones also
have on-head detection,</text><text start="382.47" dur="2.55">so they can automatically
play when you put them on</text><text start="385.02" dur="1.86">and then automatically pause
whatever you&amp;#39;re listening to</text><text start="386.88" dur="0.93">when you take &amp;#39;em off.</text><text start="387.81" dur="2.31">Pretty standard for high-end headphones.</text><text start="390.12" dur="3.33">And they also have multi-point,
multi-device connectivity.</text><text start="393.45" dur="1.83">So I add these paired to both my iPhone</text><text start="395.28" dur="1.8">and my Pixel at the same time.</text><text start="397.08" dur="2.43">And the Dyson app is pretty solid.</text><text start="399.51" dur="1.86">It lets you change and see modes,</text><text start="401.37" dur="2.91">and it still does that real time thing</text><text start="404.28" dur="3.39">where it shows you like a
graph of the last 30 seconds</text><text start="407.67" dur="2.25">of how loud it is outside the headphones</text><text start="409.92" dur="2.16">versus how loud it is
inside the headphones.</text><text start="412.08" dur="0.96">So you can see that delta</text><text start="413.04" dur="1.47">when you have noise cancellation on.</text><text start="414.51" dur="0.93">Fine. Cool.</text><text start="415.44" dur="2.22">I guess it&amp;#39;s not the most
useful feature in the world,</text><text start="417.66" dur="1.98">but it&amp;#39;s still cool to
look at once in a while.</text><text start="419.64" dur="2.49">But then of course, how do they sound?</text><text start="422.13" dur="0.93">They&amp;#39;re headphones after all,</text><text start="423.06" dur="1.26">that&amp;#39;s what people want to know.</text><text start="424.32" dur="3.9">So as your resident non-audiophile,</text><text start="428.22" dur="3.42">but someone who has listened
to a lot of headphones,</text><text start="431.64" dur="4.26">these sound solid but not amazing.</text><text start="435.9" dur="2.82">I actually did listen
to a lot of back to back</text><text start="438.72" dur="1.5">with the AirPods Max,</text><text start="440.22" dur="3.15">&amp;#39;cause that feels like the
appropriate comparison here,</text><text start="443.37" dur="4.77">and the AirPods sound better
in basically every single genre</text><text start="448.14" dur="2.94">but by like 10 to 25%.</text><text start="451.08" dur="2.7">And you can play with
the EQ in the Dyson app,</text><text start="453.78" dur="3.57">but there&amp;#39;s only three
presets, so there&amp;#39;s neutral,</text><text start="457.35" dur="2.19">that is the flattest most
honest representation.</text><text start="459.54" dur="2.01">It is actually surprisingly neutral.</text><text start="461.55" dur="3.21">Enhanced, sounds closest to AirPods Max</text><text start="464.76" dur="1.14">and it&amp;#39;s pretty good.</text><text start="465.9" dur="1.92">That&amp;#39;s my personal favorite
for listening to music.</text><text start="467.82" dur="2.49">There&amp;#39;s nice big range, deep sub-base,</text><text start="470.31" dur="2.28">and then still has crisp
detailed mids and highs.</text><text start="472.59" dur="2.64">And then bass boost sounds horrible</text><text start="475.23" dur="2.52">but it does what it says,
if you&amp;#39;re into that.</text><text start="477.75" dur="1.92">I think the struggle
really is mostly to create</text><text start="479.67" dur="2.7">like an open like wide
feeling sound stage.</text><text start="482.37" dur="2.04">The inside of the ear cups
actually is pretty shallow.</text><text start="484.41" dur="2.25">It&amp;#39;s legit touching my
ear with the fabric.</text><text start="486.66" dur="2.7">So it&amp;#39;s just not the widest sound stage</text><text start="489.36" dur="1.92">and there isn&amp;#39;t as much
instrument separation</text><text start="491.28" dur="0.87">as I was hoping for.</text><text start="492.15" dur="1.59">But in general they sound</text><text start="493.74" dur="2.94">like any other rock solid B+</text><text start="496.68" dur="1.44">noise-canceling headphones would</text><text start="498.12" dur="2.01">for around like a $300 price point.</text><text start="500.13" dur="2.43">There are also eight
microphones all the way around</text><text start="502.56" dur="1.59">for active noise cancellation</text><text start="504.15" dur="1.62">and they are decently good</text><text start="505.77" dur="1.26">at getting rid of some white noise,</text><text start="507.03" dur="1.53">but they are not the strongest.</text><text start="508.56" dur="2.85">Like Sonys, Bose, and AirPods</text><text start="511.41" dur="2.22">all cancel way more background noise</text><text start="513.63" dur="2.25">and then the transparency mode is okay.</text><text start="515.88" dur="2.7">The real strength of these
headphones, if you must know,</text><text start="518.58" dur="1.44">is definitely the battery life.</text><text start="520.02" dur="2.55">What they&amp;#39;ve done with like
getting the battery cleverly</text><text start="522.57" dur="3.63">on the band instead of
resting on your ears</text><text start="526.2" dur="1.32">made a surprisingly big difference.</text><text start="527.52" dur="2.94">And it&amp;#39;s a lot of battery.
This battery life is amazing.</text><text start="530.46" dur="2.25">Like I&amp;#39;ve only had to charge it once</text><text start="532.71" dur="1.74">during this super heavy use</text><text start="534.45" dur="2.2">of like week a half
testing I&amp;#39;ve been doing.</text><text start="537.75" dur="4.68">Yeah, like 50+ hours with a
NC on is like world beating.</text><text start="542.43" dur="1.32">So, great battery life.</text><text start="543.75" dur="1.53">Plus, they actually have an off button,</text><text start="545.28" dur="1.86">which they can&amp;#39;t all say they do.</text><text start="547.14" dur="3.3">But at the end of the day these
are still Dyson headphones.</text><text start="550.44" dur="1.32">Like why do these exist?</text><text start="551.76" dur="1.38">That&amp;#39;s the real question</text><text start="553.14" dur="3.27">that I&amp;#39;ve been wondering
this whole time testing &amp;#39;em.</text><text start="556.41" dur="4.41">And I think the obvious
Business 101 answer is</text><text start="560.82" dur="2.88">Dyson spent real R&amp;amp;D money</text><text start="563.7" dur="2.34">making this stupid pair of headphones</text><text start="566.04" dur="2.31">that have an air filter attached to them</text><text start="568.35" dur="2.64">and figured they might as
well get their money&amp;#39;s worth</text><text start="570.99" dur="2.01">and also ship something that might have</text><text start="573" dur="1.77">a little bit of a larger
addressable market,</text><text start="574.77" dur="2.37">which is just headphones.</text><text start="577.14" dur="0.96">So now there&amp;#39;s headphones.</text><text start="578.1" dur="4.23">So if you aim these
squarely at AirPods Max,</text><text start="582.33" dur="0.833">which is what I did,</text><text start="583.163" dur="2.197">I feel like that&amp;#39;s the
closest thing to them,</text><text start="585.36" dur="3.03">then they don&amp;#39;t seem as ridiculous.</text><text start="588.39" dur="2.22">I mean they&amp;#39;re built just as well.</text><text start="590.61" dur="2.01">They have much more clever,</text><text start="592.62" dur="2.43">interesting customization going on.</text><text start="595.05" dur="1.8">They have decent sound.</text><text start="596.85" dur="2.73">They also have like a
solid physical controls,</text><text start="599.58" dur="1.68">and they&amp;#39;re much better with batteries.</text><text start="601.26" dur="3.3">So yeah, I guess since they&amp;#39;re
cheaper they make sense.</text><text start="604.56" dur="2.49">But however, if you compare them</text><text start="607.05" dur="5">to basically any other
high-end normal pair</text><text start="612.45" dur="2.79">of noise-canceling
headphones in the 350 range</text><text start="615.24" dur="2.07">from any of the other majors,</text><text start="617.31" dur="3.27">then yeah, these are
overpriced, straight up.</text><text start="620.58" dur="3.54">So that&amp;#39;s the verdict. Now you know.</text><text start="624.12" dur="2.31">At least the people from Dyson</text><text start="626.43" dur="3.123">can say they shipped something.</text><text start="631.08" dur="3.03">Thanks for watching. Get
you guys the next one.</text><text start="634.11" dur="0.927">Peace.</text><text start="635.037" dur="2.667">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>
