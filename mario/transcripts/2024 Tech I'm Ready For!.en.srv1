we&amp;#39;re expecting for 2024?</text><text start="12.36" dur="1.89">Now, there was plenty
of great tech in 2023:</text><text start="14.25" dur="2.94">From smartphones to cameras to VR stuff</text><text start="17.19" dur="3.03">to computers and headphones,
a bunch of good EVs,</text><text start="20.22" dur="2.22">and a bunch of even better EV promises.</text><text start="22.44" dur="1.65">But 2024 is looking up.</text><text start="24.09" dur="1.71">So these are, to me,</text><text start="25.8" dur="2.46">the most interesting
new bits of tech stuff</text><text start="28.26" dur="2.16">that we can look forward
to for this upcoming year.</text><text start="30.42" dur="1.29">Actually, right at the
beginning of every year</text><text start="31.71" dur="3.18">is CES in January, where
it&amp;#39;s out in Las Vegas.</text><text start="34.89" dur="2.37">This year, again, I will
not be there in person,</text><text start="37.26" dur="1.29">but I will have my eyes on it,</text><text start="38.55" dur="2.13">and I will be seeing if
there&amp;#39;s anything interesting</text><text start="40.68" dur="2.82">that sort of bubbles up
above the rest of the noise.</text><text start="43.5" dur="0.9">I can always count on you guys</text><text start="44.4" dur="2.43">to send me that stuff on
Twitter if you see anything.</text><text start="46.83" dur="2.16">But then also, typically kicking
off every year with a bang</text><text start="48.99" dur="2.07">is a January Samsung event.</text><text start="51.06" dur="4.38">So we&amp;#39;re expecting S24
reveal stuff pretty soon.</text><text start="55.44" dur="1.23">Also, based on the leaks,</text><text start="56.67" dur="4.92">it looks like S24 family is
gonna look very similar to S23.</text><text start="61.59" dur="1.02">So it&amp;#39;ll be curious to see what stuff</text><text start="62.61" dur="0.9">they actually do change.</text><text start="63.51" dur="2.1">But that&amp;#39;s another January thing.</text><text start="65.61" dur="1.11">We&amp;#39;re about to get that soon.</text><text start="66.72" dur="2.04">But the big headliner that appears to be</text><text start="68.76" dur="4.14">right around the corner, it
feels like, is Apple Vision Pro.</text><text start="72.9" dur="4.2">This feels like maybe the most
unprecedented Apple launch</text><text start="77.1" dur="3.6">in a long time, certainly
in my career online.</text><text start="80.7" dur="1.98">Just because, you know,
love &amp;#39;em, hate &amp;#39;em,</text><text start="82.68" dur="2.13">Apple is one of the biggest
tech companies in the world,</text><text start="84.81" dur="2.7">and them doing such a
weird launch like this</text><text start="87.51" dur="1.83">is pretty fascinating.</text><text start="89.34" dur="1.56">So they&amp;#39;ve shown it on stage,</text><text start="90.9" dur="1.32">they did that announcement video.</text><text start="92.22" dur="2.52">And they announced it
months ahead of time,</text><text start="94.74" dur="3.24">but they have not shown
a single Apple employee</text><text start="97.98" dur="3.03">or executive wearing it even once.</text><text start="101.01" dur="2.04">And they&amp;#39;ve let people
actually test this thing out,</text><text start="103.05" dur="1.29">including myself many times,</text><text start="104.34" dur="2.546">but nobody has been
allowed to film themself</text><text start="106.886" dur="1.834">using it at all.</text><text start="108.72" dur="0.833">And just in general,</text><text start="109.553" dur="1.537">there&amp;#39;s still a lot of
unanswered questions</text><text start="111.09" dur="1.89">about how it&amp;#39;s going to work,</text><text start="112.98" dur="1.56">what it&amp;#39;s going to be really good at,</text><text start="114.54" dur="2.16">what you&amp;#39;re going to want to use it for.</text><text start="116.7" dur="1.95">Are you going to have to
go into an Apple store</text><text start="118.65" dur="1.29">to get custom fit</text><text start="119.94" dur="1.8">to actually be able to
buy one of these things?</text><text start="121.74" dur="2.79">It&amp;#39;s just shaping up to be
one of the most interesting</text><text start="124.53" dur="2.55">new products in a long time.</text><text start="127.08" dur="1.41">Now, it&amp;#39;s super expensive.</text><text start="128.49" dur="2.07">We all know that. 3,500 bucks.</text><text start="130.56" dur="1.95">So it&amp;#39;s, for sure, not for everyone.</text><text start="132.51" dur="2.52">Most people I know don&amp;#39;t
even plan on getting one,</text><text start="135.03" dur="2.19">but it is for those early adopters</text><text start="137.22" dur="1.83">who are curious about the VR stuff.</text><text start="139.05" dur="2.07">And those who do,</text><text start="141.12" dur="3">I already know will be very
impressed by the pass-through,</text><text start="144.12" dur="1.11">which is incredible.</text><text start="145.23" dur="2.88">By the immersion and the
resolution, which is really good.</text><text start="148.11" dur="3.27">By the eye tracking, which
is borderline magical.</text><text start="151.38" dur="2.25">But also, it feels like it&amp;#39;s
going to be hard to review</text><text start="153.63" dur="1.95">because it doesn&amp;#39;t really compete against</text><text start="155.58" dur="1.86">any of the other VR headsets.</text><text start="157.44" dur="2.82">Like, it is much more expensive
than any of the others.</text><text start="160.26" dur="2.31">So it doesn&amp;#39;t compete against them,</text><text start="162.57" dur="2.34">but then also, it feels
like, okay, that means</text><text start="164.91" dur="2.7">it has no competition,
which is kind of weird, too.</text><text start="167.61" dur="1.74">It&amp;#39;s just, it&amp;#39;s fascinating.</text><text start="169.35" dur="0.96">I will say if you wanna go back</text><text start="170.31" dur="1.44">and watch my initial impressions</text><text start="171.75" dur="2.01">after I first tried Apple Vision Pro</text><text start="173.76" dur="2.73">the day it got announced, I
will link that video below.</text><text start="176.49" dur="1.35">That&amp;#39;s one thing, you know,</text><text start="177.84" dur="1.62">I think this headset is going to be</text><text start="179.46" dur="2.13">technically impressive to
the people that try it.</text><text start="181.59" dur="2.19">But the other half of the story
that&amp;#39;s completely unwritten</text><text start="183.78" dur="2.22">is, what apps are gonna come out for it?</text><text start="186" dur="1.65">What are the killer features</text><text start="187.65" dur="2.28">and the use cases going to turn out to be</text><text start="189.93" dur="3.03">that it turns out Apple
Vision Pro is really good at?</text><text start="192.96" dur="2.4">I had his vision of, like,
wearing it on the airplane</text><text start="195.36" dur="0.833">and watching a movie,</text><text start="196.193" dur="2.707">wearing the headset
for a four-hour flight,</text><text start="198.9" dur="0.99">but it&amp;#39;s also so heavy,</text><text start="199.89" dur="1.86">that I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;d
wanna wear it for that long?</text><text start="201.75" dur="2.25">And will the battery
actually last that long?</text><text start="204" dur="2.4">There&amp;#39;s so many questions,
not a lot of answers yet,</text><text start="206.4" dur="2.04">so looking forward to that for this year.</text><text start="208.44" dur="2.34">But you know what I have
almost no doubt about?</text><text start="210.78" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;m calling it now, remember
the word &amp;quot;multimodal.&amp;quot;</text><text start="214.02" dur="1.92">Just for 2024,</text><text start="215.94" dur="3.75">this is going to be the
year of multimodal AI.</text><text start="219.69" dur="1.74">See, we&amp;#39;ve seen so much of the focus on AI</text><text start="221.43" dur="1.62">for these past couple years.</text><text start="223.05" dur="2.37">Or, the past two years or so,
it feels like a long time.</text><text start="225.42" dur="2.79">But it&amp;#39;s mainly just been
these chatbots, right?</text><text start="228.21" dur="1.83">Where they&amp;#39;re trained
on all this information,</text><text start="230.04" dur="1.44">and then you give it a text prompt,</text><text start="231.48" dur="1.32">and it gives you a text answer.</text><text start="232.8" dur="3.15">So it could generate, you know,
some new interesting prompts</text><text start="235.95" dur="1.59">or it can summarize something for you</text><text start="237.54" dur="2.25">or it can sort of spit
out something creative.</text><text start="239.79" dur="1.83">But it&amp;#39;s text in, text out.</text><text start="241.62" dur="3">But we are right now at the
beginning of starting to see</text><text start="244.62" dur="3.3">what&amp;#39;s called multimodal AI,
which all that really means</text><text start="247.92" dur="2.46">is it&amp;#39;s more than one
different type of medium</text><text start="250.38" dur="2.34">input into this AI system.</text><text start="252.72" dur="4.08">So it&amp;#39;ll be able to
understand text or audio</text><text start="256.8" dur="2.52">or images or video</text><text start="259.32" dur="2.79">and be able to work with that
and still give you an output.</text><text start="262.11" dur="2.34">So Google got in trouble
a couple of days ago</text><text start="264.45" dur="1.2">because they faked a video.</text><text start="265.65" dur="1.41">And it&amp;#39;s still on their YouTube channel.</text><text start="267.06" dur="1.92">It&amp;#39;s a six-minute video of them</text><text start="268.98" dur="3.87">asking their new multimodal
Gemini Ultra AI model</text><text start="272.85" dur="1.56">a bunch of different questions in a row</text><text start="274.41" dur="3.51">about, you know, stuff it
sees being put on a table,</text><text start="277.92" dur="1.23">drawings.</text><text start="279.15" dur="2.34">You know, this guy puts objects
in the frame, et cetera,</text><text start="281.49" dur="2.611">and it&amp;#39;s very conversational
about all this stuff.</text><text start="284.101" dur="2.699">(cups scraping)</text><text start="286.8" dur="1.55">- [Gemini] The cup to the left.</text><text start="289.38" dur="1.44">- [Demonstrator] Nice!</text><text start="290.82" dur="0.99">- So that was fake.</text><text start="291.81" dur="1.83">Or, at least, heavily edited.</text><text start="293.64" dur="2.46">But I honestly didn&amp;#39;t really care.</text><text start="296.1" dur="2.58">The idea, to me, of it
actually being that advanced,</text><text start="298.68" dur="0.96">it never crossed my mind</text><text start="299.64" dur="1.71">that that could be actually realtime.</text><text start="301.35" dur="1.92">But the idea,</text><text start="303.27" dur="2.16">the idea of being able to feed</text><text start="305.43" dur="3.36">your virtual assistant anything,</text><text start="308.79" dur="2.52">that, to me, is the leveling up of this AI</text><text start="311.31" dur="1.08">that we&amp;#39;ve been hoping for.</text><text start="312.39" dur="2.07">Just being able to give it
whatever&amp;#39;s in front of you.</text><text start="314.46" dur="2.64">Just be able to show it
something or type out text</text><text start="317.1" dur="1.62">or read it something or whatever,</text><text start="318.72" dur="2.465">and all of that still works?</text><text start="321.185" dur="2.275">I&amp;#39;m excited for eventually having</text><text start="323.46" dur="2.31">a multimodal Google Assistant,
whenever that happens.</text><text start="325.77" dur="1.38">I also even did a Short recently</text><text start="327.15" dur="2.55">about the Meta AI smart glasses.</text><text start="329.7" dur="1.17">They have a camera on the front,</text><text start="330.87" dur="1.59">but they also have an AI model</text><text start="332.46" dur="1.74">in the glasses themselves,
in the computer.</text><text start="334.2" dur="3.18">And that AI model is now,
in an early access program,</text><text start="337.38" dur="3.15">multimodal, and so you can
look at stuff with the glasses,</text><text start="340.53" dur="1.56">and it&amp;#39;ll be able to help you with it.</text><text start="342.09" dur="3.48">Look, all I&amp;#39;m saying is multimodal AI.</text><text start="345.57" dur="2.04">Just remember that word for now.</text><text start="347.61" dur="1.53">And that&amp;#39;s not even counting
all the rest of the stuff</text><text start="349.14" dur="1.65">AI is genuinely useful for</text><text start="350.79" dur="1.5">that&amp;#39;s not even consumer-facing,</text><text start="352.29" dur="3.75">from finding patterns in
immense amounts of data</text><text start="356.04" dur="3.63">to be able to better predict
and control wildfires</text><text start="359.67" dur="4.38">or to be able to invent new
materials or cure diseases.</text><text start="364.05" dur="1.2">What a world we live in.</text><text start="365.25" dur="2.16">- We truly live in an age of wonders.</text><text start="367.41" dur="1.89">- Now, new hardware is always fun, right?</text><text start="369.3" dur="1.35">You know, new phones, new tablets,</text><text start="370.65" dur="1.5">new computers, all that stuff.</text><text start="372.15" dur="1.26">You wanna know something
interesting, though,</text><text start="373.41" dur="1.68">about last year?</text><text start="375.09" dur="4.833">Not a single new iPad
was released in 2023.</text><text start="381.15" dur="0.833">Makes you think.</text><text start="381.983" dur="1.267">Now, the thing about the iPad</text><text start="383.25" dur="3.03">is Apple does tend to
make a couple occasional,</text><text start="386.28" dur="2.76">like, amazing hardware
changes to the iPad Pro.</text><text start="389.04" dur="1.5">I think the iPad Pro is genuinely one</text><text start="390.54" dur="2.7">of the most impressive
pieces of hardware tech</text><text start="393.24" dur="1.71">that I&amp;#39;ve ever used.</text><text start="394.95" dur="1.59">And then they do that every year or two,</text><text start="396.54" dur="1.95">but then at the end of the day you use it,</text><text start="398.49" dur="2.04">and it&amp;#39;s still an iPad.</text><text start="400.53" dur="1.2">So I say this with some hesitation,</text><text start="401.73" dur="1.98">but I am actually really looking forward</text><text start="403.71" dur="3.66">to seeing the rumored new OLED iPad Pro</text><text start="407.37" dur="0.833">in 2024.</text><text start="408.203" dur="2.317">That&amp;#39;s something we&amp;#39;ve heard
that we might get for a while.</text><text start="410.52" dur="2.34">We already have an OLED S8 Ultra.</text><text start="412.86" dur="1.83">That tablet is amazing looking,</text><text start="414.69" dur="3.48">and I wanna see a super bright
OLED display on an iPad.</text><text start="418.17" dur="1.38">We&amp;#39;ll see if that shows up soon.</text><text start="419.55" dur="2.16">But one more interesting design change</text><text start="421.71" dur="1.65">we&amp;#39;re actually expecting with Apple,</text><text start="423.36" dur="2.13">is actually the Watch 10,</text><text start="425.49" dur="2.46">the Series 10 10th generation Apple Watch.</text><text start="427.95" dur="1.26">All signs are pointing towards</text><text start="429.21" dur="1.68">a truly redesigned Apple Watch</text><text start="430.89" dur="1.71">for the first time really ever</text><text start="432.6" dur="1.83">in this year&amp;#39;s Apple Watch 10.</text><text start="434.43" dur="0.99">Now, I mean, let&amp;#39;s be real:</text><text start="435.42" dur="2.67">Apple Watch has looked kind
of the same for a long time.</text><text start="438.09" dur="1.5">Yes, the Ultra is a little different.</text><text start="439.59" dur="2.22">It&amp;#39;s a little bigger, a
little flatter on the front.</text><text start="441.81" dur="2.73">But the Series 9 looks
just like a Series 8,</text><text start="444.54" dur="3.21">which looks just like a
Series 7, Series 6, Series 5.</text><text start="447.75" dur="1.65">So they&amp;#39;re all the same shape,</text><text start="449.4" dur="2.67">other than basically the bezel
getting a little bit thinner.</text><text start="452.07" dur="1.32">Now, change for the sake of change</text><text start="453.39" dur="1.47">isn&amp;#39;t really useful on its face,</text><text start="454.86" dur="1.32">but I just think the Apple Watch</text><text start="456.18" dur="2.55">feels like it actually could
use a fresh coat of paint,</text><text start="458.73" dur="3.24">just a little design, a little
refresh to get up to date</text><text start="461.97" dur="2.37">with the Galaxy Watches of the world.</text><text start="464.34" dur="2.46">Nice circles. I think it would look nice.</text><text start="466.8" dur="1.44">Also, have you heard that the Apple Watch</text><text start="468.24" dur="3.39">is, like, dangerously close
to being banned in the US?</text><text start="471.63" dur="2.43">Which is a whole separate story</text><text start="474.06" dur="2.19">maybe worth a whole separate video.</text><text start="476.25" dur="0.833">We&amp;#39;ll stay tuned on that.</text><text start="477.083" dur="1.417">Oh, and RCS on the iPhone.</text><text start="478.5" dur="1.71">I&amp;#39;m excited for RCS</text><text start="480.21" dur="3.42">to finally come to the
iPhone sometime in 2024.</text><text start="483.63" dur="2.25">They haven&amp;#39;t said when, but
Apple&amp;#39;s committed to it.</text><text start="485.88" dur="2.67">I usually don&amp;#39;t root for tech to die,</text><text start="488.55" dur="3.27">but I do think it&amp;#39;s time to
be done with SMS forever.</text><text start="491.82" dur="1.89">So, welcome on board.</text><text start="493.71" dur="1.08">Now, this one&amp;#39;s more general,</text><text start="494.79" dur="3.24">but I am actually hoping this year</text><text start="498.03" dur="3.48">for some actually interesting smartphones.</text><text start="501.51" dur="0.9">I&amp;#39;ll put it that way.</text><text start="502.41" dur="2.13">Because obviously,</text><text start="504.54" dur="2.19">this is probably a
little bit of a crazy ask</text><text start="506.73" dur="1.47">because smartphones are clearly mature,</text><text start="508.2" dur="1.47">and they all are kind of looking the same,</text><text start="509.67" dur="1.723">and they improve a little bit every year.</text><text start="511.393" dur="2.477">Even the folding ones now</text><text start="513.87" dur="2.88">are kind of looking the same
as they did the year before.</text><text start="516.75" dur="3.87">But I think this is a good ripe time</text><text start="520.62" dur="2.82">for a new, maybe mid-range.</text><text start="523.44" dur="1.74">It&amp;#39;s not gonna be the
flagship, the big hitters,</text><text start="525.18" dur="1.8">but maybe a mid-range smartphone</text><text start="526.98" dur="1.83">to really try something crazy new.</text><text start="528.81" dur="2.91">It might be a crazy risky
thing, might not happen,</text><text start="531.72" dur="1.53">but I&amp;#39;m hoping that we do get</text><text start="533.25" dur="1.47">to see something like that in 2024.</text><text start="534.72" dur="1.29">And then, also, I&amp;#39;ve said this before,</text><text start="536.01" dur="3.63">but every single year for
the next probably 15 years</text><text start="539.64" dur="1.59">is going to be the most interesting year</text><text start="541.23" dur="1.71">for electric cars yet,</text><text start="542.94" dur="2.61">and I don&amp;#39;t think 2024 is
any exception to that rule.</text><text start="545.55" dur="2.85">And, you know, we&amp;#39;ve got a
bunch of really solid EVs</text><text start="548.4" dur="1.71">already out there in the world, right?</text><text start="550.11" dur="3.12">The most popular new car
in the world is an EV,</text><text start="553.23" dur="2.13">and there&amp;#39;s already some really
good ones in North America.</text><text start="555.36" dur="2.61">Also, the NACS port has very quickly</text><text start="557.97" dur="1.44">gotten a ton of commitments</text><text start="559.41" dur="2.25">from pretty much everyone
making electric cars.</text><text start="561.66" dur="1.44">So basically, Tesla Superchargers</text><text start="563.1" dur="2.67">will be available to
way more electric cars.</text><text start="565.77" dur="1.47">Great.</text><text start="567.24" dur="1.98">Now, this year coming up, we already have</text><text start="569.22" dur="2.58">Tesla Cybertrucks starting
to hit the streets.</text><text start="571.8" dur="0.96">That&amp;#39;s pretty crazy.</text><text start="572.76" dur="2.07">We are also definitely expecting a Model 3</text><text start="574.83" dur="3.45">and Model Y refresh very soon, imminently.</text><text start="578.28" dur="1.8">I mean, the Model 3 refresh
is already out there.</text><text start="580.08" dur="1.59">It&amp;#39;s shipping in Europe and Asia,</text><text start="581.67" dur="2.04">and I think it&amp;#39;ll be
in the US pretty soon.</text><text start="583.71" dur="1.68">Now, stay tuned to the Auto Focus channel</text><text start="585.39" dur="1.08">for a look at those.</text><text start="586.47" dur="3.09">We also just got a crazy
Porsche Taycan refresh</text><text start="589.56" dur="1.95">drop a crazy Nurburgring lap time.</text><text start="591.51" dur="3.18">So that looks to be a
competitor to the Model S Plaid</text><text start="594.69" dur="1.02">at the very high end.</text><text start="595.71" dur="1.59">But also there should be way more</text><text start="597.3" dur="1.98">hopefully more affordable EVs</text><text start="599.28" dur="1.65">coming out over the next couple of years.</text><text start="600.93" dur="0.93">So all of this,</text><text start="601.86" dur="2.13">plus some hybrids that
are somewhere in between</text><text start="603.99" dur="1.32">for people not ready to go fully electric,</text><text start="605.31" dur="2.19">that should all be the
most interesting year yet</text><text start="607.5" dur="1.08">for Auto Focus stuff.</text><text start="608.58" dur="1.62">So I&amp;#39;m excited for that.</text><text start="610.2" dur="1.26">And then, of course,
there&amp;#39;s lots of other tech</text><text start="611.46" dur="3.3">that I am hoping to see take
strides forward this year.</text><text start="614.76" dur="3.45">But also, I wanted to cap this
off with some of the videos</text><text start="618.21" dur="3.66">that I&amp;#39;m most looking
forward to here this year.</text><text start="621.87" dur="2.79">So last year, there were 70-plus
new videos on this channel,</text><text start="624.66" dur="1.29">which were super fun.</text><text start="625.95" dur="2.64">And I have this, like, threshold</text><text start="628.59" dur="3.03">for what I consider
like a certified banger.</text><text start="631.62" dur="1.68">Like, when a video...</text><text start="633.3" dur="2.94">When people approached me in real life</text><text start="636.24" dur="1.56">mentioning one of these videos,</text><text start="637.8" dur="2.13">there were a couple that
really bubbled to the top,</text><text start="639.93" dur="3.54">and those were the Tesla Solar Roof video.</text><text start="643.47" dur="2.31">The Tesla Cybertruck, actually.</text><text start="645.78" dur="2.31">Apple Vision Pro, for sure.</text><text start="648.09" dur="2.13">And the Formula 1 explain video.</text><text start="650.22" dur="0.9">Those all popped off.</text><text start="651.12" dur="2.19">I really enjoyed the Formula
1 explain video, though,</text><text start="653.31" dur="3.21">because obviously, that sport
is incredibly high-tech.</text><text start="656.52" dur="3.99">But I also think, low-key,
there is a lot of other tech</text><text start="660.51" dur="2.7">in a lot of other sports
that&amp;#39;s worth highlighting</text><text start="663.21" dur="2.04">that I think would be super
fun to make videos about.</text><text start="665.25" dur="2.52">Now, some of it is in the sport itself.</text><text start="667.77" dur="2.7">Some of it is in the
training for the sport,</text><text start="670.47" dur="1.11">you might be surprised by.</text><text start="671.58" dur="1.41">Some of it is in the broadcast.</text><text start="672.99" dur="3.33">Like, you already know about
those highlight moments.</text><text start="676.32" dur="2.76">Tennis match, you see the
ball, the slow-mo camera,</text><text start="679.08" dur="1.62">and it hits just, like, on the line,</text><text start="680.7" dur="1.71">and you get that replay instantly.</text><text start="682.41" dur="1.95">The line of scrimmage in football.</text><text start="684.36" dur="2.82">The pitch count and the
strike zone in baseball.</text><text start="687.18" dur="1.17">There&amp;#39;s tons of stuff like that.</text><text start="688.35" dur="3.45">My point is I&amp;#39;m probably making
sports tech videos in 2024</text><text start="691.8" dur="1.83">because I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of fun with those,</text><text start="693.63" dur="1.56">and I happen to be very
interested in that.</text><text start="695.19" dur="2.85">But then I also wanna do more
collaborations in general.</text><text start="698.04" dur="2.28">I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of fun with
the &amp;quot;Waveform&amp;quot; podcast.</text><text start="700.32" dur="1.8">Which if you haven&amp;#39;t
already subscribed there,</text><text start="702.12" dur="1.95">link below, get subscribed.</text><text start="704.07" dur="1.68">But we have guests on there all the time,</text><text start="705.75" dur="0.87">which are really fun.</text><text start="706.62" dur="1.71">And it highlights how much you can learn</text><text start="708.33" dur="1.35">from having conversations with people.</text><text start="709.68" dur="3.06">I think my creator conversations
are some of my favorites.</text><text start="712.74" dur="1.47">But also, just in general</text><text start="714.21" dur="2.25">collaborations with people on YouTube.</text><text start="716.46" dur="1.71">So if y&amp;#39;all have suggestions for people,</text><text start="718.17" dur="3.15">for channels you&amp;#39;d like to
see us collaborate with,</text><text start="721.32" dur="1.2">definitely leave a comment below</text><text start="722.52" dur="2.25">because that&amp;#39;s on the high list for me.</text><text start="724.77" dur="1.68">And then, there&amp;#39;s a few</text><text start="726.45" dur="1.89">top-secret projects we&amp;#39;ve been working on</text><text start="728.34" dur="1.8">over here for a while</text><text start="730.14" dur="3.24">that are finally going to launch in 2024.</text><text start="733.38" dur="1.32">You&amp;#39;ll know &amp;#39;em when you see &amp;#39;em.</text><text start="734.7" dur="1.29">There&amp;#39;ll be huge announcements.</text><text start="735.99" dur="1.86">Stay tuned here, on Twitter,</text><text start="737.85" dur="2.46">and everywhere else for that stuff.</text><text start="740.31" dur="3.127">I&amp;#39;ve included Easter eggs
to the two biggest ones</text><text start="743.437" dur="1.583">in this video.</text><text start="745.02" dur="3.21">They&amp;#39;re subtle, but once
they&amp;#39;re announced, you&amp;#39;ll know.</text><text start="748.23" dur="2.22">So, yeah, look forward to all that stuff</text><text start="750.45" dur="0.99">for the new calendar year.</text><text start="751.44" dur="0.833">I&amp;#39;m gonna wrap it up here.</text><text start="752.273" dur="1.417">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="753.69" dur="1.53">See you in 2024.</text><text start="755.22" dur="1.443">Like, starting now.</text><text start="757.5" dur="0.833">Peace.</text></transcript>
