<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="3.39">(groovy hip-hop music)</text><text start="3.39" dur="1.35">- So it&amp;#39;s a bit of a tradition around here</text><text start="4.74" dur="3.18">to unbox the newest iPhones
on the day they come out.</text><text start="7.92" dur="1.59">And we&amp;#39;re upholding
this tradition this year</text><text start="9.51" dur="4.26">to find one single difference
versus last year&amp;#39;s unboxings.</text><text start="13.77" dur="2.82">So we&amp;#39;ve got four iPhones
here in new colors:</text><text start="16.59" dur="1.8">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus,</text><text start="18.39" dur="1.74">which the boxes show
the back of the phones.</text><text start="20.13" dur="2.52">And then iPhone 16 Pro
and iPhone 16 Pro Max,</text><text start="22.65" dur="1.32">which show the front.</text><text start="23.97" dur="1.68">And I&amp;#39;m totally gonna
start with the base phones,</text><text start="25.65" dur="1.59">the crowd favorites this year.</text><text start="27.24" dur="3.18">Finally, some colors back
in the iPhone lineup.</text><text start="30.42" dur="2.4">So, I&amp;#39;m gonna call this
one the flagship color.</text><text start="32.82" dur="2.7">This is the Ultra Marine iPhone 16.</text><text start="35.52" dur="3.33">And in the box, you get the USB-C cable,</text><text start="38.85" dur="1.65">again, braided and high quality,</text><text start="40.5" dur="3.42">and then a tiny little bit of
paperwork in this pill shape.</text><text start="43.92" dur="3.87">And then you&amp;#39;ll notice no SIM
card tool, same as last year,</text><text start="47.79" dur="3.3">and no stickers this year.</text><text start="51.09" dur="3">There are no stickers included</text><text start="54.09" dur="3">in the iPhone 16 box at all.</text><text start="57.09" dur="1.32">Truly the end of an era.</text><text start="58.41" dur="1.14">They just can&amp;#39;t stop removing things,</text><text start="59.55" dur="1.35">they can&amp;#39;t help themselves.</text><text start="62.4" dur="2.34">But let&amp;#39;s get a look at the
pink plus-sized phone, too.</text><text start="64.74" dur="1.95">These phones are the
same sizes as last year:</text><text start="66.69" dur="4.05">6.1 inches for the base,
6.7 inches for the Plus.</text><text start="70.74" dur="1.32">But with the bigger batteries inside,</text><text start="72.06" dur="1.5">that&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;m
really happy to hear about</text><text start="73.56" dur="2.49">and very curious about in my testing.</text><text start="76.05" dur="2.19">But really, I&amp;#39;m just happy
we finally have colors back.</text><text start="78.24" dur="2.04">So the back of the phone,
it&amp;#39;s a little more pale,</text><text start="80.28" dur="3.09">but the glass around the
camera is a bit darker,</text><text start="83.37" dur="3.39">the rails of the phone are a
bit darker, so this is nice.</text><text start="86.76" dur="1.56">Same stuff in the box.</text><text start="88.32" dur="1.89">Now, with these Pro phones,</text><text start="90.21" dur="1.59">I think there&amp;#39;s a reason they show</text><text start="91.8" dur="1.65">the front of the phone on the box</text><text start="93.45" dur="1.32">because, if they showed the back,</text><text start="94.77" dur="2.1">you literally could
not tell the difference</text><text start="96.87" dur="1.44">versus last year.</text><text start="98.31" dur="1.8">But hey, at least this one has</text><text start="100.11" dur="2.7">slightly thinner bezels they can show.</text><text start="102.81" dur="1.14">And yeah, this year is gonna be</text><text start="103.95" dur="2.76">the Natural Titanium iPhone 16 Pro.</text><text start="106.71" dur="2.67">And aside from the lack
of stickers in the box,</text><text start="109.38" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s gonna look and feel
basically exactly like</text><text start="113.28" dur="2.55">a titanium iPhone 15 Pro.</text><text start="115.83" dur="2.7">Same USB-C cable as the
base phone, as well.</text><text start="118.53" dur="0.87">Great.</text><text start="119.4" dur="2.76">But then, this is the
new flagship Pro color.</text><text start="122.16" dur="2.22">The renders we saw at
first were kind of weird,</text><text start="124.38" dur="4.08">but this is the official
Desert Titanium color.</text><text start="128.46" dur="1.14">And you know, all of Apple&amp;#39;s phones</text><text start="129.6" dur="2.01">are, again, a bit more pale on the back,</text><text start="131.61" dur="2.1">but they have more color on these rails,</text><text start="133.71" dur="2.46">and that&amp;#39;s definitely true again here.</text><text start="136.17" dur="2.64">It&amp;#39;s kind of like a light sand color</text><text start="138.81" dur="3">but also feels similar
to the gold of the past.</text><text start="141.81" dur="0.833">But there you have it.</text><text start="142.643" dur="2.437">That&amp;#39;s the iPhone 16&amp;#39;s
unboxing experience.</text><text start="145.08" dur="1.77">So, by the time you see this uploaded,</text><text start="146.85" dur="3.51">that means I am deep
into my iPhone 16 testing</text><text start="150.36" dur="1.35">and working on the full review.</text><text start="151.71" dur="2.76">So, definitely, get subscribed
to see that when it drops.</text><text start="154.47" dur="1.32">But if there are any things</text><text start="155.79" dur="2.52">that you specifically
wanna see talked about more</text><text start="158.31" dur="1.56">or that haven&amp;#39;t been talked about enough</text><text start="159.87" dur="1.86">for the review of the phones,</text><text start="161.73" dur="1.5">let me know in the comment section below.</text><text start="163.23" dur="1.14">But I can still give you now</text><text start="164.37" dur="2.64">some quick things that I&amp;#39;ve
noticed in my first couple days,</text><text start="167.01" dur="2.67">my first week of testing, some FAQs.</text><text start="169.68" dur="3.09">So, first up, there is a size
difference versus last year.</text><text start="172.77" dur="2.46">The base phones are the
same sizes, like I said,</text><text start="175.23" dur="3.36">6.1 and 6.7 inches in the same body sizes.</text><text start="178.59" dur="2.73">But the Pro phones are both bigger.</text><text start="181.32" dur="3.18">The iPhone 16 Pro goes
from 6.1 to 6.3 inches,</text><text start="184.5" dur="1.53">and even though it has thinner bezels,</text><text start="186.03" dur="3.21">yes, the phone is slightly
taller and slightly wider.</text><text start="189.24" dur="1.95">And then, the iPhone 16 Pro Max</text><text start="191.19" dur="4.38">goes from 6.7 inches to
6.9 inches diagonally,</text><text start="195.57" dur="2.97">which is now just an
absolutely gigantic phone.</text><text start="198.54" dur="1.08">I mean, it was already huge,</text><text start="199.62" dur="2.43">but it&amp;#39;s now even taller and wider.</text><text start="202.05" dur="1.2">Biggest phone they&amp;#39;ve ever made.</text><text start="203.25" dur="1.98">If you look at it next
to the Galaxy S24 Ultra,</text><text start="205.23" dur="2.43">that&amp;#39;s another absolutely
huge phone for some context,</text><text start="207.66" dur="1.38">and that phone has a stylus in it.</text><text start="209.04" dur="2.49">So obviously, Apple&amp;#39;s put
more battery in this phone,</text><text start="211.53" dur="0.9">which is great to see.</text><text start="212.43" dur="2.37">I&amp;#39;m glad they&amp;#39;re not going
the opposite direction</text><text start="214.8" dur="2.31">of, like, making it thinner
or shrinking the batteries.</text><text start="217.11" dur="1.38">But yeah, just it&amp;#39;s
definitely good to know</text><text start="218.49" dur="1.8">if you&amp;#39;re going with the
new Pro Max this year,</text><text start="220.29" dur="2.16">you are getting a truly huge,</text><text start="222.45" dur="1.53">like, borderline tablet-sized phone.</text><text start="223.98" dur="0.96">Also, random tidbit:</text><text start="224.94" dur="2.37">Thanks to these new
cameras up in the corners,</text><text start="227.31" dur="3.63">these new iPhones are
big-time table rockers.</text><text start="230.94" dur="3.21">Like, big-time uneven camera on the back.</text><text start="234.15" dur="2.79">It&amp;#39;s annoying to me &amp;#39;cause I
type on the table sometimes.</text><text start="236.94" dur="2.04">Anyway, I&amp;#39;ve also been
taking some pictures</text><text start="238.98" dur="1.53">and videos with the new cameras.</text><text start="240.51" dur="1.95">I&amp;#39;ll be taking and
posting many, many more.</text><text start="242.46" dur="1.35">If you wanna follow me on Instagram,</text><text start="243.81" dur="1.23">that&amp;#39;s where you&amp;#39;ll see some more</text><text start="245.04" dur="2.04">in the next couple of days,
but I&amp;#39;ll link that below.</text><text start="247.08" dur="3.09">My first impression is
it&amp;#39;s kind of remarkable</text><text start="250.17" dur="3.39">how consistent Apple&amp;#39;s
image processing pipeline is</text><text start="253.56" dur="3.06">to get the same look every year.</text><text start="256.62" dur="2.01">Like a lot of times, we see
companies switch sensors.</text><text start="258.63" dur="1.8">Even the Pixels switched sensors</text><text start="260.43" dur="1.83">after using the same old one for a while,</text><text start="262.26" dur="2.16">and the whole look kind of changed.</text><text start="264.42" dur="1.56">But it really feels like year over year,</text><text start="265.98" dur="1.65">no matter how many hardware changes,</text><text start="267.63" dur="2.49">no matter how many sensor
changes these phones go through,</text><text start="270.12" dur="2.49">they still just very much
have the iPhone look,</text><text start="272.61" dur="1.26">which, I mean, makes sense.</text><text start="273.87" dur="1.32">This just shallower depth of field</text><text start="275.19" dur="1.32">from the larger physical sensor.</text><text start="276.51" dur="1.71">I have also run some benchmarks.</text><text start="278.22" dur="2.58">So these are the new Geekbench 6 scores</text><text start="280.8" dur="3">for the new A18/A18 Pro in these phones,</text><text start="283.8" dur="2.19">which are new versus last year.</text><text start="285.99" dur="2.13">Really not noticing, like, a huge</text><text start="288.12" dur="1.86">difference in performance
with these brand-new phones.</text><text start="289.98" dur="2.19">Obviously, you&amp;#39;re gonna feel
that more at the very high end</text><text start="292.17" dur="2.22">and in the long term as these phones age.</text><text start="294.39" dur="1.86">But what Geekbench also did reveal</text><text start="296.25" dur="1.35">is all of these phones across the board</text><text start="297.6" dur="1.2">have eight gigs of RAM now.</text><text start="298.8" dur="1.95">So, there&amp;#39;s typically been
different amounts of RAM</text><text start="300.75" dur="2.25">in the Pro phone versus the regular phone.</text><text start="303" dur="0.833">Now, there&amp;#39;s not.</text><text start="303.833" dur="1.867">Now, they all have eight gigs of RAM.</text><text start="305.7" dur="2.91">So Apple was giving us a
lot of talk in that keynote</text><text start="308.61" dur="1.86">about how these are the first phones</text><text start="310.47" dur="3.333">built from the ground up
for Apple Intelligence.</text><text start="315" dur="1.29">Is that what this means?</text><text start="316.29" dur="1.56">I mean, you clearly need a lot of memory</text><text start="317.85" dur="1.74">to run these AI models,</text><text start="319.59" dur="2.4">and there&amp;#39;s also a more
powerful neural engine</text><text start="321.99" dur="1.53">on all the phones versus last year.</text><text start="323.52" dur="1.83">So maybe that&amp;#39;s a part of it, too.</text><text start="325.35" dur="4.92">But all that talk and these
phones all launch with iOS 18.0,</text><text start="330.27" dur="4.68">which has exactly zero Apple
Intelligence features on them</text><text start="334.95" dur="1.983">at launch out the box.</text><text start="337.8" dur="1.17">But that&amp;#39;s a rant for another day.</text><text start="338.97" dur="2.34">But clearly, the biggest
physical new change</text><text start="341.31" dur="4.23">on these new phones is
this added button here.</text><text start="345.54" dur="4.44">And Apple refused to call
it a button in the keynote</text><text start="349.98" dur="0.96">and then doubled down.</text><text start="350.94" dur="2.31">They also did a bunch of,
like, executive interviews</text><text start="353.25" dur="1.17">on various YouTube channels</text><text start="354.42" dur="1.95">that you can go watch from that day,</text><text start="356.37" dur="2.1">and even in those interviews,</text><text start="358.47" dur="2.97">they continue to refuse
to call it a button.</text><text start="361.44" dur="1.41">It&amp;#39;s so weird.</text><text start="362.85" dur="1.71">- To just put out the
biggest burning fire,</text><text start="364.56" dur="2.28">right up front, in the discourse.</text><text start="366.84" dur="1.295">It is a real button, right?</text><text start="368.135" dur="2.166">- Ah!
(group laughing)</text><text start="370.301" dur="2.779">- It&amp;#39;s a physical thing
that depresses, right?</text><text start="373.08" dur="2.22">- I think it&amp;#39;s a first of its kind.</text><text start="375.3" dur="3.69">There is a tactile switch, that
gives you that final click.</text><text start="378.99" dur="1.26">- So, just to clear it up,</text><text start="380.25" dur="4.14">it is an actual moving
clicking physical button</text><text start="384.39" dur="1.876">that is called Camera Control.</text><text start="386.266" dur="2.264">(laughs) But it&amp;#39;s more than a button.</text><text start="388.53" dur="2.82">It&amp;#39;s also made it to all these
phones, not just the Pros.</text><text start="391.35" dur="0.99">So, let me jump into that.</text><text start="392.34" dur="3.18">This Camera Control button,
as the name implies,</text><text start="395.52" dur="2.55">only controls camera-related things.</text><text start="398.07" dur="1.83">So it&amp;#39;s not like another Action button,</text><text start="399.9" dur="1.47">it&amp;#39;s a Camera Control button.</text><text start="401.37" dur="2.43">You can hit it once it
opens up the camera,</text><text start="403.8" dur="2.04">you can hit it again to take a photo,</text><text start="405.84" dur="1.2">and then you can hold it down</text><text start="407.04" dur="1.29">to start recording a quick video.</text><text start="408.33" dur="1.98">But it&amp;#39;s also a large capacitive</text><text start="410.31" dur="3.03">touch-sensitive surface with
a vibration motor underneath.</text><text start="413.34" dur="1.83">So it doesn&amp;#39;t actually half-press,</text><text start="415.17" dur="1.41">but with that vibration motor,</text><text start="416.58" dur="2.04">it can mimic the feeling of a half-press,</text><text start="418.62" dur="1.5">like a real camera would have.</text><text start="420.12" dur="1.08">And you can double-tap</text><text start="421.2" dur="3.03">to flip through various
camera controls like zoom</text><text start="424.23" dur="2.37">or photographic styles, or tone.</text><text start="426.6" dur="1.29">It takes some getting used to.</text><text start="427.89" dur="1.17">I mean, these swipes,</text><text start="429.06" dur="2.31">they also you can see
have momentum physics too,</text><text start="431.37" dur="2.37">so you can swipe too fast or too far</text><text start="433.74" dur="1.68">and go past what you were aiming for</text><text start="435.42" dur="1.83">or zoom past where you thought you would.</text><text start="437.25" dur="1.26">So it can feel a bit finicky</text><text start="438.51" dur="1.5">and silly as you start using it,</text><text start="440.01" dur="2.55">especially since you can
literally do all this stuff</text><text start="442.56" dur="2.07">with the buttons already on the screen.</text><text start="444.63" dur="1.62">But when you use Camera Control,</text><text start="446.25" dur="2.4">all of the rest of those
buttons just fade away</text><text start="448.65" dur="2.94">and disappear, kind of
encouraging you to continue using</text><text start="451.59" dur="2.01">the Camera Control to find
what you&amp;#39;re trying to do.</text><text start="453.6" dur="1.23">It&amp;#39;s really interesting.</text><text start="454.83" dur="4.02">The placement feels like it was
made with landscape in mind,</text><text start="458.85" dur="3.03">but landscape ideally
would&amp;#39;ve been at the corner.</text><text start="461.88" dur="1.68">But they also know a lot
of people take photos</text><text start="463.56" dur="0.833">and videos like this,</text><text start="464.393" dur="1.927">so it can&amp;#39;t be all the way at the bottom.</text><text start="466.32" dur="0.833">So they moved it up.</text><text start="467.153" dur="2.977">So, it&amp;#39;s kind of splitting
the difference here.</text><text start="470.13" dur="3.54">And also, third-party apps
will be able to plug into it</text><text start="473.67" dur="1.62">if they use the camera.</text><text start="475.29" dur="1.71">So this is already working with Kino,</text><text start="477" dur="0.96">and it&amp;#39;s supposed to start working</text><text start="477.96" dur="2.04">with Snapchat pretty soon as well.</text><text start="480" dur="1.71">And you can imagine other
apps that use the camera</text><text start="481.71" dur="1.89">will just decide what
they wanna do with it.</text><text start="483.6" dur="1.11">I was also curious, though,</text><text start="484.71" dur="2.43">and I said this in that
original impressions video,</text><text start="487.14" dur="4.2">how cases would deal with
this new button surface thing.</text><text start="491.34" dur="1.74">So it turns out there&amp;#39;s
basically two options.</text><text start="493.08" dur="4.89">Option number one is just a
cutout in the side of the case.</text><text start="497.97" dur="1.95">Just cut it out, expose it to the finger.</text><text start="499.92" dur="1.11">So it&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="501.03" dur="2.22">That&amp;#39;s probably what
most cheap cases will do,</text><text start="503.25" dur="2.61">but that also means it&amp;#39;s
no longer gonna be flush</text><text start="505.86" dur="2.01">with the side of the case.</text><text start="507.87" dur="1.08">But then there&amp;#39;s option number two,</text><text start="508.95" dur="2.16">which is what Apple&amp;#39;s
first-party cases do,</text><text start="511.11" dur="3.6">which is putting in this
little insert, which has glass</text><text start="514.71" dur="1.98">and transfers the capacitance</text><text start="516.69" dur="2.16">from the button outside of the case</text><text start="518.85" dur="2.37">to the Camera Control of the phone itself</text><text start="521.22" dur="2.04">and maintaining that flush feel.</text><text start="523.26" dur="1.8">And it feels like it works pretty well.</text><text start="525.06" dur="1.62">The half press still works fine,</text><text start="526.68" dur="1.5">the swiping still works fine,</text><text start="528.18" dur="1.74">the vibration motor transfers through.</text><text start="529.92" dur="2.703">And the Beats by Dre cases
also already have this.</text><text start="534.69" dur="1.98">Yeah, I&amp;#39;m just gonna say
that again real quick</text><text start="536.67" dur="2.35">in case you were just
phasing out for a second.</text><text start="539.94" dur="3.45">There&amp;#39;s Beats by Dre iPhone
cases now. (chuckles)</text><text start="543.39" dur="3.15">Like, since when does Beats make cases?</text><text start="546.54" dur="1.77">Like, why does Beats make cases?</text><text start="548.31" dur="2.43">I thought, I don&amp;#39;t know,
there was a theme of, like,</text><text start="550.74" dur="1.59">Beats being audio products,</text><text start="552.33" dur="1.41">but there&amp;#39;s something new going on here.</text><text start="553.74" dur="1.83">Maybe now they&amp;#39;re just iPhone accessories?</text><text start="555.57" dur="0.833">I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="556.403" dur="0.847">But yeah, they&amp;#39;ve got a nice little</text><text start="557.25" dur="3.3">Camera Control button thing
on their new iPhone cases,</text><text start="560.55" dur="0.84">which is nice.</text><text start="561.39" dur="2.79">I kind of wish, and I&amp;#39;m not alone,</text><text start="564.18" dur="3.06">that this was also Touch ID,</text><text start="567.24" dur="4.14">but then they couldn&amp;#39;t call
it Camera Control, I guess.</text><text start="571.38" dur="3.54">I wonder if that&amp;#39;s in the
future of this button.</text><text start="574.92" dur="2.25">But anyway, speaking of
third-party accessories,</text><text start="577.17" dur="2.37">that&amp;#39;s where dbrand stepped
in to sponsor this video.</text><text start="579.54" dur="2.1">So, for this sponsor segment,
we&amp;#39;re gonna be doing something</text><text start="581.64" dur="1.5">a little bit different.</text><text start="583.14" dur="2.91">See, screen protectors,
not my favorite thing.</text><text start="586.05" dur="1.44">They&amp;#39;re kind of a chore to install,</text><text start="587.49" dur="3.36">between the dust and the
alignment and getting it perfect.</text><text start="590.85" dur="2.79">That&amp;#39;s a big part of why I
don&amp;#39;t use them all the time.</text><text start="593.64" dur="3.27">But that&amp;#39;s where channel
