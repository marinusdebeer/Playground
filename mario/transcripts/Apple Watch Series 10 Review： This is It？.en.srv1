<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.008" dur="2.582">(bright music)</text><text start="2.59" dur="2.78">- Okay, so there were rumors,
there were serious rumors</text><text start="5.37" dur="2.61">that the 10th generation Apple Watch</text><text start="7.98" dur="2.55">was gonna be the one that
gets this huge redesign.</text><text start="10.53" dur="1.44">Like, remember the iPhone 10,</text><text start="11.97" dur="1.98">that sort of reset the design language</text><text start="13.95" dur="1.17">of the whole iPhone line?</text><text start="15.12" dur="2.7">And 10 is just such a nice
round even number, right?</text><text start="17.82" dur="1.2">So we just kind of figured</text><text start="19.02" dur="1.98">that maybe the Apple Watch
would do the same thing.</text><text start="21" dur="2.91">And I even remember in my last few years</text><text start="23.91" dur="1.29">of reviewing the Apple Watch,</text><text start="25.2" dur="2.4">Series 8, Series 9,</text><text start="27.6" dur="2.22">I was like, &amp;quot;Look, these are good watches,</text><text start="29.82" dur="2.257">but clearly, very
incremental improvements.&amp;quot;</text><text start="32.077" dur="1.253">&amp;quot;So if you want a big upgrade,</text><text start="33.33" dur="1.83">maybe wait till the 10th gen one.&amp;quot;</text><text start="35.16" dur="1.2">And so now here we are,</text><text start="36.36" dur="5">I&amp;#39;ve been using Apple Watch
Series 10 for the past week,</text><text start="41.94" dur="3.45">and it&amp;#39;s... it&amp;#39;s....</text><text start="45.39" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s definitely another
incremental upgrade.</text><text start="48.69" dur="1.98">Now, you know, that&amp;#39;s not
necessarily a bad thing.</text><text start="50.67" dur="2.94">Obviously, it&amp;#39;s not as
exciting as a total redesign,</text><text start="53.61" dur="3.69">but that definitely makes
this review pretty simple</text><text start="57.3" dur="1.92">as far as whether you
should get one or not.</text><text start="59.22" dur="3.15">The main physical differences
this time on the outside are,</text><text start="62.37" dur="2.64">it&amp;#39;s slightly thinner
and lighter and bigger.</text><text start="65.01" dur="1.86">So the numbers say 10% thinner</text><text start="66.87" dur="2.01">and 10% lighter for the aluminum one,</text><text start="68.88" dur="1.98">and then they actually
drop stainless steel</text><text start="70.86" dur="2.25">in favor of titanium
on the higher-end ones,</text><text start="73.11" dur="2.1">so that&amp;#39;s 20% lighter.</text><text start="75.21" dur="3.63">And the screens of both
sizes are now even bigger.</text><text start="78.84" dur="3.39">And the result is really
just that you can see more,</text><text start="82.23" dur="1.95">and it&amp;#39;s just more
comfortable on the wrist.</text><text start="84.18" dur="1.83">In fact, it actually just feels</text><text start="86.01" dur="1.92">like someone took last year&amp;#39;s Apple Watch</text><text start="87.93" dur="1.98">and just squashed it down a little bit.</text><text start="89.91" dur="2.13">And there you go, that&amp;#39;s the new design.</text><text start="92.04" dur="1.38">And of course, it&amp;#39;s more
complicated than that.</text><text start="93.42" dur="2.61">Like, there is a new metal
back that&amp;#39;s one piece now,</text><text start="96.03" dur="3.33">and there&amp;#39;s a new re-engineered
speaker that&amp;#39;s 30% smaller,</text><text start="99.36" dur="1.11">so it can fit in this,</text><text start="100.47" dur="1.65">and just other pieces like shuffled around</text><text start="102.12" dur="2.22">to fit in this new shape.</text><text start="104.34" dur="4.53">But the end result is very much
still an incremental update</text><text start="108.87" dur="2.31">instead of some dramatic new form factor.</text><text start="111.18" dur="2.52">I actually think now this
visually reminds me more than ever</text><text start="113.7" dur="3">of a Pixel Watch just depending
on what face you have,</text><text start="116.7" dur="3.09">just because of the way the
top edges are curved even more,</text><text start="119.79" dur="2.28">and the way everything just
kind of melts into the sides,</text><text start="122.07" dur="2.4">especially with this new Jet Black color.</text><text start="124.47" dur="1.23">It&amp;#39;s just way bigger.</text><text start="125.7" dur="1.2">In fact, it&amp;#39;s true</text><text start="126.9" dur="2.79">the larger 46-millimeter
Apple Watch Series 10</text><text start="129.69" dur="2.61">basically now runs the same screen size</text><text start="132.3" dur="1.29">as the Apple Watch Ultra.</text><text start="133.59" dur="1.65">And Apple loves to do that thing,</text><text start="135.24" dur="2.52">where they show an older
watch on the screen,</text><text start="137.76" dur="2.64">and then the newer watch with
a bigger screen next to it,</text><text start="140.4" dur="2.64">and brag about how, &amp;quot;Hey
there&amp;#39;s a bigger screen</text><text start="143.04" dur="1.8">so you can get even more text,</text><text start="144.84" dur="1.95">and even more content on the screen,</text><text start="146.79" dur="2.79">and it&amp;#39;s easier to type on
that onscreen keyboard.&amp;quot;</text><text start="149.58" dur="2.04">And to be honest, it never really made</text><text start="151.62" dur="1.59">that much of a big difference to me</text><text start="153.21" dur="1.56">other than maybe the Ultra.</text><text start="154.77" dur="2.7">But this year, I noticed
something very specific.</text><text start="157.47" dur="1.71">The Disc Sports Workout</text><text start="159.18" dur="2.79">now shows one extra line of information.</text><text start="161.97" dur="1.74">So instead of time, active calories,</text><text start="163.71" dur="1.83">total calories, and heart rate,</text><text start="165.54" dur="2.19">it now shows me time, active calories,</text><text start="167.73" dur="3.69">total calories, heart rate... and miles.</text><text start="171.42" dur="1.47">So, there&amp;#39;s that.</text><text start="172.89" dur="1.65">I think watchOS 11 literally just adds</text><text start="174.54" dur="1.83">an extra line of text in some instances</text><text start="176.37" dur="1.8">with these bigger screens,
which is kind of funny.</text><text start="178.17" dur="1.47">But speaking of watchOS 11,</text><text start="179.64" dur="2.4">that launches on these new watches</text><text start="182.04" dur="1.53">and gets pushed as a software update</text><text start="183.57" dur="1.62">to some older Apple Watches.</text><text start="185.19" dur="2.7">So you&amp;#39;re gonna get things
like the new Vitals app,</text><text start="187.89" dur="1.56">which gives you a sort of energy score,</text><text start="189.45" dur="2.4">kind of like the Garmin Body Battery.</text><text start="191.85" dur="2.34">And there&amp;#39;s a sleep apnea detection,</text><text start="194.19" dur="3.18">which just got FDA approval
to detect and notify you</text><text start="197.37" dur="1.86">of potentially high levels of sleep apnea</text><text start="199.23" dur="2.25">using only the accelerometer.</text><text start="201.48" dur="1.56">And there&amp;#39;s training load as well,</text><text start="203.04" dur="3.24">which keeps track of the
perceived intensity of workouts.</text><text start="206.28" dur="1.35">That stuff is nice,</text><text start="207.63" dur="1.29">and it&amp;#39;s also, like I said,</text><text start="208.92" dur="2.61">coming to some older
Apple Watches as well.</text><text start="211.53" dur="1.74">So if you really wanna know</text><text start="213.27" dur="4.71">what stuff is specifically
coming just to this newest watch,</text><text start="217.98" dur="2.76">so like a reason to get this one,</text><text start="220.74" dur="2.55">then there&amp;#39;s about four
that you should know about.</text><text start="223.29" dur="2.91">Okay, so let me know if these are enough</text><text start="226.2" dur="2.7">to convince you to get this newest watch.</text><text start="228.9" dur="2.91">So number one, with
this redesigned speaker,</text><text start="231.81" dur="3.72">you can now listen to media
out loud on the watch.</text><text start="235.53" dur="1.44">So meaning you could already</text><text start="236.97" dur="1.86">like take phone calls
and set alarms and stuff,</text><text start="238.83" dur="2.34">but now you can literally just play media,</text><text start="241.17" dur="4.08">like music or podcasts
or audio books out loud.</text><text start="245.25" dur="3.42">So you could be on a hike and
just forget your headphones,</text><text start="248.67" dur="3.36">and just... you could be that guy.</text><text start="252.03" dur="2.46">But don&amp;#39;t, don&amp;#39;t be that guy.</text><text start="254.49" dur="4.32">So the number two, this is
now an updated LTPO 3 display,</text><text start="258.81" dur="1.47">which means it&amp;#39;ll go all the way down</text><text start="260.28" dur="2.19">to 1 hertz instead of 10 hertz.</text><text start="262.47" dur="2.37">So now it can show the
second hand all the time</text><text start="264.84" dur="1.29">when the Always On Display is on</text><text start="266.13" dur="1.71">because it doesn&amp;#39;t take up extra battery.</text><text start="267.84" dur="2.19">Plus, it has slightly noticeably better</text><text start="270.03" dur="2.49">off-axis viewing angles,</text><text start="272.52" dur="2.04">which actually helps for a watch,</text><text start="274.56" dur="1.47">so you can sort of glance</text><text start="276.03" dur="2.28">and check the watch and still see it</text><text start="278.31" dur="2.343">without looking like
you&amp;#39;re checking your watch.</text><text start="280.653" dur="4.5">Then number three, there is a
new water temperature sensor.</text><text start="286.92" dur="1.62">So here&amp;#39;s the thing.</text><text start="288.54" dur="1.26">I don&amp;#39;t know if you can
tell by looking at me,</text><text start="289.8" dur="2.58">but I don&amp;#39;t really spend too
much time around deep water.</text><text start="292.38" dur="2.1">So I don&amp;#39;t have any test results</text><text start="294.48" dur="2.013">for this particular new sensor,</text><text start="297.39" dur="1.05">but it&amp;#39;s there now.</text><text start="298.44" dur="1.86">So.. great.</text><text start="300.3" dur="2.19">But then number four, faster charging.</text><text start="302.49" dur="1.53">So cared about this one?</text><text start="304.02" dur="2.43">Turns out, so if you use
the Puck that comes with it,</text><text start="306.45" dur="1.8">this is how you maximize
your charging speed,</text><text start="308.25" dur="3">you can now get it up
to somewhere around 65%</text><text start="311.25" dur="1.74">from dead in half an hour.</text><text start="312.99" dur="2.67">It&amp;#39;s supposed to be 80% actually,</text><text start="315.66" dur="1.98">but we couldn&amp;#39;t get it quite that fast.</text><text start="317.64" dur="2.46">But nevertheless, the faster
charging speed is very welcome.</text><text start="320.1" dur="3.12">And that&amp;#39;s it, that&amp;#39;s the new
big 10th generation update.</text><text start="323.22" dur="2.4">There&amp;#39;s also the new S10 SiP inside,</text><text start="325.62" dur="2.43">which doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be noticeably faster</text><text start="328.05" dur="1.53">or better at anything than in the S9.</text><text start="329.58" dur="1.32">It has an improved neural engine</text><text start="330.9" dur="3.03">but hasn&amp;#39;t been enabling
anything that the S9 can&amp;#39;t do.</text><text start="333.93" dur="3.18">So yeah, is that enough?</text><text start="337.11" dur="1.77">And the more I thought about it, honestly,</text><text start="338.88" dur="5">my take is that now that Apple
has called this a redesign.</text><text start="344.46" dur="1.2">Like, if you watch the keynote,</text><text start="345.66" dur="1.417">they were like, &amp;quot;This is a huge deal.&amp;quot;</text><text start="347.077" dur="2.813">&amp;quot;This is a big new 10th
generation redesign.&amp;quot;</text><text start="349.89" dur="1.44">Now that they&amp;#39;ve done that,</text><text start="351.33" dur="2.46">I&amp;#39;m fairly sure that that means</text><text start="353.79" dur="2.37">that this is what the Apple
Watch is going to look like</text><text start="356.16" dur="3.42">for the next 5 to 10 more years.</text><text start="359.58" dur="3.09">Like, if this is a real
redesign for Apple,</text><text start="362.67" dur="1.05">then we&amp;#39;re gonna be back</text><text start="363.72" dur="2.43">to even smaller changes from here on.</text><text start="366.15" dur="1.44">Really, the only parts of this update</text><text start="367.59" dur="2.25">that made a big difference at all to me</text><text start="369.84" dur="3.09">are the larger display
and faster charging.</text><text start="372.93" dur="1.35">The larger display for obvious reasons.</text><text start="374.28" dur="1.41">The faster charging is nice,</text><text start="375.69" dur="1.56">especially just &amp;#39;cause
if you wanna drop it</text><text start="377.25" dur="1.14">on a charger for a few minutes</text><text start="378.39" dur="2.4">and get a bunch of use, then you can.</text><text start="380.79" dur="1.08">I would find it even better</text><text start="381.87" dur="2.34">if I was doing sleep tracking as well.</text><text start="384.21" dur="1.29">But I&amp;#39;ve mentioned this before,</text><text start="385.5" dur="2.55">I&amp;#39;m not because I&amp;#39;m using the Eight Sleep</text><text start="388.05" dur="1.89">for all my sleep tracking metrics,</text><text start="389.94" dur="1.41">and so shout out to Eight Sleep</text><text start="391.35" dur="1.32">for sponsoring this portion of the video.</text><text start="392.67" dur="2.37">The Eight Sleep has been so good to me,</text><text start="395.04" dur="2.64">which is why I&amp;#39;m mentioning
it in previous videos.</text><text start="397.68" dur="1.62">And you&amp;#39;ve already heard
about this new one,</text><text start="399.3" dur="2.43">the Pod 4 Ultra, which can get super cool</text><text start="401.73" dur="3.51">or super warm to each side
of the bed independently.</text><text start="405.24" dur="2.64">But also, yeah, it&amp;#39;s doing
that biometric tracking</text><text start="407.88" dur="3.39">with 99% accuracy no
matter how you&amp;#39;re sleeping,</text><text start="411.27" dur="1.68">which I think is actually an advantage</text><text start="412.95" dur="2.1">over something on the back of your wrist.</text><text start="415.05" dur="2.07">So then you just jump in the
app and you can see, you know,</text><text start="417.12" dur="2.31">here&amp;#39;s the different stages of sleep here.</text><text start="419.43" dur="1.92">I&amp;#39;ve been waking up in the
middle of the night randomly</text><text start="421.35" dur="2.01">since coming back from
Australia&amp;#39;s time zone,</text><text start="423.36" dur="2.22">but this is a pretty
good night right here.</text><text start="425.58" dur="3.03">You can see heart rate, heart
rate variability, breath rate.</text><text start="428.61" dur="1.65">No snoring, which is great. (chuckles)</text><text start="430.26" dur="1.08">And it&amp;#39;s helping me get back</text><text start="431.34" dur="2.19">into my sleep routine
here on the East Coast,</text><text start="433.53" dur="2.34">and it can help anyone
sleep better, honestly.</text><text start="435.87" dur="0.96">So you just add the Pod</text><text start="436.83" dur="1.92">to your current mattress
like a fitted sheet,</text><text start="438.75" dur="1.29">and it automatically cools down</text><text start="440.04" dur="1.38">or warms up each side of the bed.</text><text start="441.42" dur="2.22">So you can go to eightsleep.com/mkbhd</text><text start="443.64" dur="3.12">and get $350 off Pod 4 Ultra,</text><text start="446.76" dur="1.98">or 200 bucks off the Pod 4.</text><text start="448.74" dur="3.06">And then you can also leave
your wearable on the nightstand.</text><text start="451.8" dur="2.34">But okay, so if you have
an older Apple Watch,</text><text start="454.14" dur="2.61">Series 4, 5, 6, 7,</text><text start="456.75" dur="1.5">and you want a new one,</text><text start="458.25" dur="2.1">then okay, yeah, this
is the upgrade to get.</text><text start="460.35" dur="2.73">That&amp;#39;s like the easiest,
no-brainer conclusion</text><text start="463.08" dur="1.05">in the world for this product.</text><text start="464.13" dur="2.49">But I&amp;#39;m going the extra step as a reviewer</text><text start="466.62" dur="2.49">and predicting the future of this product,</text><text start="469.11" dur="2.91">and just based on Apple&amp;#39;s
language in their presentations,</text><text start="472.02" dur="3.66">I really don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re
getting any planned big upgrades</text><text start="475.68" dur="3.78">to this watch for a while,
which is unfortunate.</text><text start="479.46" dur="3.21">But like, all those major
features we are thinking about,</text><text start="482.67" dur="4.08">like a rotating bezel,
or a circular shape,</text><text start="486.75" dur="3">or a meaningful
improvement to the battery,</text><text start="489.75" dur="1.92">any of which would&amp;#39;ve
been the biggest change</text><text start="491.67" dur="1.8">to the Apple Watch in years,</text><text start="493.47" dur="2.79">we didn&amp;#39;t get any of that
with this 10th gen redesign.</text><text start="496.26" dur="2.76">So it feels like they&amp;#39;re not
planning on doing any of it.</text><text start="499.02" dur="1.35">So this is the 10th gen Apple watch,</text><text start="500.37" dur="3.067">and this feels like
Apple&amp;#39;s big statement of,</text><text start="503.437" dur="2.123">&amp;quot;This is the Apple Watch.&amp;quot; (chuckles)</text><text start="505.56" dur="2.97">It&amp;#39;s the squircle, no rotating bezel,</text><text start="508.53" dur="2.46">these are the buttons, this is the shape,</text><text start="510.99" dur="3.48">18-hour battery life, over and over again.</text><text start="514.47" dur="1">Take it or leave it.</text><text start="516.33" dur="1.71">That&amp;#39;s it, that&amp;#39;s the review.</text><text start="518.04" dur="1.41">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="519.45" dur="2.031">I&amp;#39;ll catch you guys in
the next one, peace.</text><text start="521.481" dur="2.583">(bright music)</text></transcript>
