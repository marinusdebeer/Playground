<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="4.47">- So this here is my
Titanium iPhone 15 Pro</text><text start="4.47" dur="3.57">that I&amp;#39;ve been using
with no case for 88 days,</text><text start="8.04" dur="1.32">or about three months now.</text><text start="9.36" dur="1.77">I wanna do more longer term reviews.</text><text start="11.13" dur="2.79">Not that three months is a
super long time to have a phone,</text><text start="13.92" dur="3.51">but in the usual smartphone
review space, at least,</text><text start="17.43" dur="2.58">for me, it&amp;#39;s one to two weeks with a phone</text><text start="20.01" dur="2.67">before I&amp;#39;m summarizing
everything from my experience</text><text start="22.68" dur="1.05">and putting it into a review.</text><text start="23.73" dur="1.29">And so the longer I use a phone,</text><text start="25.02" dur="1.89">the more I&amp;#39;m able to
actually uncover about it,</text><text start="26.91" dur="2.43">especially about the way I use it.</text><text start="29.34" dur="2.82">So as someone who carries
two phones all the time</text><text start="32.16" dur="4.17">and the iPhone typically is
in my pocket for a long time,</text><text start="36.33" dur="2.13">I have a lot more stuff for this iPhone.</text><text start="38.46" dur="2.46">So first things first, I
haven&amp;#39;t put my phone in a case</text><text start="40.92" dur="1.2">since the day I bought it.</text><text start="42.12" dur="2.28">Sometimes I regret
this, sometimes I don&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="44.4" dur="1.89">It&amp;#39;s pretty rare that I
actually drop my phone</text><text start="46.29" dur="2.55">and this one also hasn&amp;#39;t yet been dropped,</text><text start="48.84" dur="3.72">but it does show some pretty
normal signs of wear and tear.</text><text start="52.56" dur="1.23">But it&amp;#39;s nothing too concerning.</text><text start="53.79" dur="5">Like, I always start to get
some bigger cuts, like this,</text><text start="58.89" dur="1.32">on my front display glass</text><text start="60.21" dur="2.94">because of my refusal to
put on a screen protector.</text><text start="63.15" dur="2.01">And these here aren&amp;#39;t any more</text><text start="65.16" dur="1.53">or less than usual despite, you know,</text><text start="66.69" dur="1.26">the fancy ceramic shield.</text><text start="67.95" dur="2.4">But I do really like
the switch to titanium</text><text start="70.35" dur="2.43">for the frame and the side
rails around this phone.</text><text start="72.78" dur="2.64">It looks way better than
the stainless steel.</text><text start="75.42" dur="0.99">It&amp;#39;s also lighter</text><text start="76.41" dur="2.13">and I am also glad I went
with this lighter color</text><text start="78.54" dur="3.03">because this combo seems to
show the fewest fingerprints.</text><text start="81.57" dur="1.02">It looks the cleanest.</text><text start="82.59" dur="1.38">Overall, though I feel like I&amp;#39;m happy</text><text start="83.97" dur="1.86">with this spec that I went with.</text><text start="85.83" dur="1.47">Now, long-term behavior,</text><text start="87.3" dur="2.88">there are three really interesting
things about this phone.</text><text start="90.18" dur="2.13">Two of them, I feel
like I&amp;#39;m using way less</text><text start="92.31" dur="1.92">than I thought I would and one of them,</text><text start="94.23" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;m using basically exactly
as much as I thought I would.</text><text start="97.53" dur="3.21">So first of all, in the
camera of the Pro iPhone,</text><text start="100.74" dur="1.41">this was the first year Apple announced</text><text start="102.15" dur="2.67">this sort of neat multiple
focal lengths feature.</text><text start="104.82" dur="3.03">So you can hit that 1x
button three different times</text><text start="107.85" dur="2.58">and get three different focal
lengths, 24 millimeters,</text><text start="110.43" dur="1.71">then 28 millimeters,</text><text start="112.14" dur="3.75">then 35 millimeter focal lengths,
all with the same quality.</text><text start="115.89" dur="3.3">I pretty much never use this feature.</text><text start="119.19" dur="0.833">I don&amp;#39;t know if that means</text><text start="120.023" dur="1.957">I&amp;#39;m, like, not a true
smartphone photographer,</text><text start="121.98" dur="3.45">but I always just frame things at 1x</text><text start="125.43" dur="1.5">and that seems to be the end of it for me.</text><text start="126.93" dur="1.14">So I just don&amp;#39;t use that feature,</text><text start="128.07" dur="1.83">even though our testing
does show that it works.</text><text start="129.9" dur="2.85">But I still think the new
button they added to iOS 17,</text><text start="132.75" dur="2.94">where if you zoom in on a
photo, a crop button appears</text><text start="135.69" dur="2.49">and that actually crops the photo.</text><text start="138.18" dur="3.12">That&amp;#39;s significantly more
useful of a feature for me</text><text start="141.3" dur="1.74">and I actually think for
a lot of other people.</text><text start="143.04" dur="2.01">But then the action button is another one.</text><text start="145.05" dur="2.1">So this is a pretty big headlining feature</text><text start="147.15" dur="1.53">on this year&amp;#39;s Pro iPhones,</text><text start="148.68" dur="2.79">this rare ability to
actually customize something</text><text start="151.47" dur="0.833">on your iPhone.</text><text start="152.303" dur="1.837">So I definitely feel like the UI</text><text start="154.14" dur="2.22">that they built into the
settings is still one</text><text start="156.36" dur="3.48">of the weirdest most
un-Apple-like stapled in pieces</text><text start="159.84" dur="1.32">of UI I&amp;#39;ve ever seen them do.</text><text start="161.16" dur="1.89">But hey, it works, it&amp;#39;s great.</text><text start="163.05" dur="0.96">You can map the button</text><text start="164.01" dur="2.07">to basically almost anything you want.</text><text start="166.08" dur="1.47">But a lot of people
made a great observation</text><text start="167.55" dur="2.04">about the placement of this button</text><text start="169.59" dur="1.11">when the phone first launched,</text><text start="170.7" dur="2.1">which is, like, the
reason that mute switch</text><text start="172.8" dur="1.59">that we used to have was so great,</text><text start="174.39" dur="1.56">is &amp;#39;cause it was sort of
tucked up in the corner</text><text start="175.95" dur="0.833">and out of the way.</text><text start="176.783" dur="1.957">So you could just never
even think about it.</text><text start="178.74" dur="2.7">Just leave your phone on
mute forever and be fine.</text><text start="181.44" dur="3.15">But Apple is very stubborn
about placing this action button</text><text start="184.59" dur="3.6">in the exact same spot where
the mute switch used to be,</text><text start="188.19" dur="2.43">which does mean it&amp;#39;s
kind of out of the way.</text><text start="190.62" dur="2.07">It&amp;#39;s a little bit, annoyingly,
not very reachable,</text><text start="192.69" dur="1.89">especially when you use
the phone with one hand.</text><text start="194.58" dur="2.76">So when I first got the phone,
I mean, I was going nuts</text><text start="197.34" dur="2.34">with all the possibilities
of the crazy things</text><text start="199.68" dur="1.77">that I could think of to do with it.</text><text start="201.45" dur="2.34">First thing I did was map
it to Google Assistant,</text><text start="203.79" dur="2.91">since I never use Siri,
but having a quick toggle</text><text start="206.7" dur="3.48">to the better assistant is
hilarious and more useful to me.</text><text start="210.18" dur="2.01">Then I later briefly switched it</text><text start="212.19" dur="4.157">to toggle starting a new voice
conversation with ChatGPT.</text><text start="216.347" dur="3.403">So the ChatGPT chatbot has its own voice</text><text start="219.75" dur="2.25">and you can have a voice
conversation with it</text><text start="222" dur="1.2">and it&amp;#39;s really cool,</text><text start="223.2" dur="2.4">but it isn&amp;#39;t the most
useful thing in the world.</text><text start="225.6" dur="3.24">Like, it&amp;#39;s cool that it can
do complex math and reasoning</text><text start="228.84" dur="1.8">and generate new things for you,</text><text start="230.64" dur="3.06">but then it can&amp;#39;t see your
calendar or tell you the weather</text><text start="233.7" dur="1.44">or do anything current events related.</text><text start="235.14" dur="1.71">So that didn&amp;#39;t last long.</text><text start="236.85" dur="2.94">So then I switched to
starting a new dialogue box</text><text start="239.79" dur="4.02">for a new task in my to-do
list app of choice, TickTick,</text><text start="243.81" dur="1.11">and this one&amp;#39;s pretty cool.</text><text start="244.92" dur="2.25">You hit the button and it
literally opens a text box</text><text start="247.17" dur="1.74">and you just start typing a new task.</text><text start="248.91" dur="1.5">Really, really nice if you just happen</text><text start="250.41" dur="1.92">to remember something somewhere.</text><text start="252.33" dur="2.43">But I also totally still
have the muscle memory</text><text start="254.76" dur="3.42">to just go home and open
the app whenever I need it.</text><text start="258.18" dur="1.74">I also have a lock screen task to do that.</text><text start="259.92" dur="2.19">So it was a little bit redundant for me.</text><text start="262.11" dur="1.59">So I&amp;#39;ve ended up with my action button</text><text start="263.7" dur="4.68">just being set to open the
camera and that&amp;#39;s the fastest,</text><text start="268.38" dur="2.25">most convenient way to
get to the camera for me.</text><text start="270.63" dur="2.07">Yes, there is a lock screen shortcut also,</text><text start="272.7" dur="2.91">but I just find that
if I am doing something</text><text start="275.61" dur="1.44">and I just need to quickly
get a picture of something</text><text start="277.05" dur="2.64">that&amp;#39;s happening or
something&amp;#39;s about to go away,</text><text start="279.69" dur="0.833">I don&amp;#39;t wanna miss it.</text><text start="280.523" dur="1.867">Like, I just have this muscle memory now</text><text start="282.39" dur="2.37">to just hit that button
and just take the photo.</text><text start="284.76" dur="1.89">You can actually have
it open to take a selfie</text><text start="286.65" dur="1.62">or take some other types
of photos or videos.</text><text start="288.27" dur="1.98">I just have it open to
viewfinder and I&amp;#39;m good.</text><text start="290.25" dur="2.16">So then, of course, USB Type-C</text><text start="292.41" dur="2.73">was the biggest headlining feature</text><text start="295.14" dur="3.12">of this newest generation of
iPhones, hilariously enough.</text><text start="298.26" dur="2.82">Slow USB 2.0 speeds on the base iPhone 15,</text><text start="301.08" dur="4.56">but then USB 3.2 speeds
on the 15 Pro and Pro Max,</text><text start="305.64" dur="2.22">which makes a pretty big difference</text><text start="307.86" dur="2.28">when importing tons of ProRes footage,</text><text start="310.14" dur="1.83">even if it isn&amp;#39;t Thunderbolt speeds yet.</text><text start="311.97" dur="3.69">First of all, thank you,
Europe, it&amp;#39;s about damn time.</text><text start="315.66" dur="2.64">Even as someone who is a pretty
heavy wireless charger user,</text><text start="318.3" dur="1.5">I do have to say, it is much nicer.</text><text start="319.8" dur="1.95">It&amp;#39;s been great to just have one cable</text><text start="321.75" dur="2.91">to charge almost
everything from this iPhone</text><text start="324.66" dur="4.8">to any Android phone to
the iPad Pro to my laptop.</text><text start="329.46" dur="2.43">But unfortunately, I have
not been able to get rid</text><text start="331.89" dur="2.79">of my lightning cable just yet</text><text start="334.68" dur="2.7">because there are still
other things in my ecosystem,</text><text start="337.38" dur="1.05">in Apple&amp;#39;s ecosystem,</text><text start="338.43" dur="2.73">that haven&amp;#39;t switched to USB-C quite yet.</text><text start="341.16" dur="4.11">Mostly because AirPods Max is
my headphones for traveling</text><text start="345.27" dur="2.91">of choice and I still have
to carry the lightning cable</text><text start="348.18" dur="1.2">everywhere just to charge those.</text><text start="349.38" dur="2.19">But there&amp;#39;s also still the Magic keyboard</text><text start="351.57" dur="1.74">and the Apple Magic Trackpad.</text><text start="353.31" dur="1.89">I really don&amp;#39;t know how
long it&amp;#39;s gonna take Apple</text><text start="355.2" dur="1.65">to go through and also update</text><text start="356.85" dur="2.58">all of these things to be USB Type-C,</text><text start="359.43" dur="2.28">but I guess my lightning
cables are sticking</text><text start="361.71" dur="0.99">around a little while longer</text><text start="362.7" dur="1.98">until they refresh all that stuff.</text><text start="364.68" dur="2.55">The AirPods Max came
out at the end of 2020,</text><text start="367.23" dur="1.86">so word on the street is they may be due</text><text start="369.09" dur="2.85">for a refresh sometime
soon, but we don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="371.94" dur="1.95">Definitely get subscribed to
see the review of the new ones</text><text start="373.89" dur="2.64">whenever they do come
out, but as of right now,</text><text start="376.53" dur="0.833">they&amp;#39;re still lightning.</text><text start="377.363" dur="1.927">So there have been
several software updates</text><text start="379.29" dur="2.07">to the iPhone 15 lineup since it came out.</text><text start="381.36" dur="2.88">It launched on iOS 17, which
made all types of headlines,</text><text start="384.24" dur="3.24">but then we&amp;#39;ve already
made it to iOS 17.2.</text><text start="387.48" dur="1.89">The new Journal app is live now,</text><text start="389.37" dur="2.43">which I have a few friends
that use, but I don&amp;#39;t use it.</text><text start="391.8" dur="1.83">There&amp;#39;s, of course, been
a bunch of bug fixes</text><text start="393.63" dur="2.28">and optimizations since
we heard about, you know,</text><text start="395.91" dur="2.52">the Instagram app and
those random heat problems.</text><text start="398.43" dur="2.49">Those seem to also be fixed and gone.</text><text start="400.92" dur="3.03">And there&amp;#39;s also a
curious new little button</text><text start="403.95" dur="1.17">in the camera app.</text><text start="405.12" dur="2.94">So if you go to Settings and then Camera</text><text start="408.06" dur="2.43">and then under Formats,
there&amp;#39;s a new toggle</text><text start="410.49" dur="4.23">to be able to record spatial
video for the Apple Vision Pro.</text><text start="414.72" dur="2.7">So things seem to be
lining up interestingly</text><text start="417.42" dur="3.75">for the Vision Pro to actually
launch sometime in January</text><text start="421.17" dur="1.86">or February, which should be pretty cool.</text><text start="423.03" dur="1.53">And if you remember watching that one demo</text><text start="424.56" dur="2.22">of spatial videos on the Vision Pro, yes,</text><text start="426.78" dur="3.39">you can record them on the
headset, which looks hilarious,</text><text start="430.17" dur="3">but you can also record them on an iPhone,</text><text start="433.17" dur="3.54">specifically only on an
iPhone 15 or 15 Pro so far</text><text start="436.71" dur="1.89">because of the horizontal alignment</text><text start="438.6" dur="2.07">of the main and ultra-wide cameras.</text><text start="440.67" dur="1.44">So if you go into the camera app</text><text start="442.11" dur="2.4">with that new check toggled, in video,</text><text start="444.51" dur="1.68">there&amp;#39;s a little headset icon,</text><text start="446.19" dur="1.86">and if I select that, I&amp;#39;m now shooting</text><text start="448.05" dur="3.39">that special spatial video,
which means a few things.</text><text start="451.44" dur="2.46">First of all, you must
turn your iPhone sideways</text><text start="453.9" dur="1.86">to landscape because your
eyes are next to each other</text><text start="455.76" dur="1.47">and not on top of each other.</text><text start="457.23" dur="2.55">And it also will limit you to 1080p 30fps</text><text start="459.78" dur="2.79">because it&amp;#39;s actually
processing two streams</text><text start="462.57" dur="0.96">of video at once,</text><text start="463.53" dur="2.31">one from the primary
camera that you can see,</text><text start="465.84" dur="1.92">but then the other one
from the ultra-wide camera</text><text start="467.76" dur="0.833">for your other eye.</text><text start="468.593" dur="1.867">So you can go crazy
right now and just go out</text><text start="470.46" dur="2.73">and start shooting a bunch of
spatial videos on your iPhone.</text><text start="473.19" dur="1.89">But if you go watch them on your phone,</text><text start="475.08" dur="2.16">they will look just like normal videos</text><text start="477.24" dur="1.38">because it&amp;#39;s only gonna play back</text><text start="478.62" dur="1.38">the video from the main camera.</text><text start="480" dur="3.18">If you wanna see and
appreciate the spatialness</text><text start="483.18" dur="3.27">of the video, you will
need an Apple Vision Pro.</text><text start="486.45" dur="2.46">Now, I&amp;#39;ve actually gotten to
experience the App Vision Pro</text><text start="488.91" dur="3.45">a few more times since
that initial preview video</text><text start="492.36" dur="3.21">that I did from Apple Park, flex, I know.</text><text start="495.57" dur="1.44">But what I&amp;#39;ve actually gotten to do</text><text start="497.01" dur="2.01">with it is shoot a bunch
of my own spatial videos</text><text start="499.02" dur="2.82">and then watch them back on the headset.</text><text start="501.84" dur="3.66">And the main thing I really
learned is they look okay.</text><text start="505.5" dur="2.01">I think the dramatic part is, like,</text><text start="507.51" dur="3.9">when you get the subject
within two, three, four feet</text><text start="511.41" dur="1.71">of the camera, then it&amp;#39;s,
like, really dramatic,</text><text start="513.12" dur="1.05">kind of like a 3D movie.</text><text start="514.17" dur="1.53">Then you see things popping out at you.</text><text start="515.7" dur="2.19">So Pro tip, if you&amp;#39;re gonna take a bunch</text><text start="517.89" dur="2.34">of spatial videos now,
that&amp;#39;s the sweet spot</text><text start="520.23" dur="1.29">for it to actually be worth it.</text><text start="521.52" dur="1.44">Oh, and also, another Pro tip,</text><text start="522.96" dur="1.29">it took me months to learn this,</text><text start="524.25" dur="1.56">but if you ever have anything happening</text><text start="525.81" dur="3.87">on the Dynamic Island, you
can swipe across it to hide it</text><text start="529.68" dur="2.22">or change the view style,
in case you&amp;#39;re annoyed</text><text start="531.9" dur="2.4">by, like, a train ticket
or an Uber delivery</text><text start="534.3" dur="1.62">that&amp;#39;s taken up space up there</text><text start="535.92" dur="1.77">or something you just don&amp;#39;t
wanna see up there anymore.</text><text start="537.69" dur="2.58">So go ahead and swipe, the more you know.</text><text start="540.27" dur="2.88">So clearly, you don&amp;#39;t have to
upgrade your phone every year</text><text start="543.15" dur="2.85">or every two years or very often at all.</text><text start="546" dur="2.22">But the more I use this phone, the 15 Pro,</text><text start="548.22" dur="3.3">the more I&amp;#39;m confident that
this is one of the good years</text><text start="551.52" dur="4.14">to upgrade, from the updated
cameras to the USB Type-C</text><text start="555.66" dur="1.62">to the titanium.</text><text start="557.28" dur="2.91">Like, there&amp;#39;s the concept
of an upgrade sweet spot,</text><text start="560.19" dur="1.92">and I feel like this phone hit it,</text><text start="562.11" dur="1.95">especially for people
with much older iPhones.</text><text start="564.06" dur="1.89">So I&amp;#39;ll leave you with this.</text><text start="565.95" dur="2.46">In the original iPhone 15 Pro Review,</text><text start="568.41" dur="3.25">I compared this phone to the Porsche 911</text><text start="572.52" dur="2.97">in that the design doesn&amp;#39;t
really change a whole lot</text><text start="575.49" dur="1.41">from generation to generation.</text><text start="576.9" dur="3.03">They, instead, spend a
really long time refining</text><text start="579.93" dur="3.03">and honing in on a slightly better version</text><text start="582.96" dur="1.14">of the same thing.</text><text start="584.1" dur="2.85">So I just turned 30 recently.</text><text start="586.95" dur="1.26">Still weird saying that out loud,</text><text start="588.21" dur="4.74">but for my 30th birthday, I
