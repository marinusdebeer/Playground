fit in the trunk of a Tesla,</text><text start="8.82" dur="1.17">or whatever the question was--</text><text start="9.99" dur="1.11">- Oh, I didn&amp;#39;t see that, that&amp;#39;s hilarious.</text><text start="11.1" dur="2.22">- Someone made that
tweet on the LTT handle.</text><text start="13.32" dur="0.833">- Oh, that&amp;#39;s really funny.</text><text start="14.153" dur="1.507">- And it did it!</text><text start="15.66" dur="2.37">It looked up the dimensions
of the LTT backpack,</text><text start="18.03" dur="0.833">it looked up the dimensions--
- Shut up.</text><text start="18.863" dur="1.417">- Of the trunk and it figured it out.</text><text start="20.28" dur="1.47">- How the (beep) did it do that?</text><text start="21.75" dur="1.2">- Ask it, let&amp;#39;s do it live!</text><text start="22.95" dur="1.38">- Because I thought the dimensions</text><text start="24.33" dur="2.94">for the backpack are in picture form.</text><text start="27.27" dur="1.71">- [Luke] Searching.</text><text start="28.98" dur="0.833">Searching for that.</text><text start="29.813" dur="0.833">Now it&amp;#39;s searching</text><text start="30.646" dur="1.412">for backpack dimensions.
- Shut up!</text><text start="32.058" dur="1.622">Shut up!
- Look at this!</text><text start="33.68" dur="0.833">- Have different shapes and dimensions,</text><text start="34.513" dur="2.642">based on some rough estimates
I will try to answer it.</text><text start="37.155" dur="1.333">- That&amp;#39;s insane!</text><text start="40.71" dur="1.8">That&amp;#39;s actually nuts.</text><text start="42.51" dur="1.11">- Based on some videos</text><text start="43.62" dur="2.49">of the Model Y trunk, shut up!</text><text start="46.11" dur="2.46">It can fit about five to seven
standard carryon suitcases</text><text start="48.57" dur="1.83">which have similar
dimensions and capacity.</text><text start="50.4" dur="2.28">Holy--
- Which is accurate.</text><text start="52.68" dur="3.12">That statement is real.
- (beep)</text><text start="55.8" dur="3.57">- That&amp;#39;s crazy!</text><text start="59.37" dur="1.56">- Look at this.</text><text start="60.93" dur="1.23">How did this happen?</text><text start="62.16" dur="3.75">How did Bing, no offense,
Microsoft, but how did Bing</text><text start="65.91" dur="3.12">just beat Google to the
punch so dramatically</text><text start="69.03" dur="2.46">at something that&amp;#39;s so important</text><text start="71.49" dur="3.302">and so core to their business?</text><text start="74.792" dur="1.918">Well, there&amp;#39;s actually a
really good reason for it.</text><text start="76.71" dur="3.45">So AI has been blowing up
lately, both in the news</text><text start="80.16" dur="2.76">and in real life applications
across a ton of industries.</text><text start="82.92" dur="1.56">So, you know, years ago it was only</text><text start="84.48" dur="2.49">in relatively small things
like helping doctors</text><text start="86.97" dur="3.27">detect cancer early using
advanced pattern recognition,</text><text start="90.24" dur="1.53">and then a little bit more over the years</text><text start="91.77" dur="1.65">with things like autonomous vehicles.</text><text start="93.42" dur="1.17">But now AI is everywhere.</text><text start="94.59" dur="2.64">It&amp;#39;s creating whole
original pieces of art.</text><text start="97.23" dur="2.208">It&amp;#39;s holding conversations
with humans all over the place.</text><text start="99.438" dur="2.412">It seems like we&amp;#39;ve just arrived</text><text start="101.85" dur="1.77">at the beginning of the AI age.</text><text start="103.62" dur="1.38">There&amp;#39;s this chart that keeps popping up</text><text start="105" dur="1.14">that hits extra hard,</text><text start="106.14" dur="3.63">which is the time to
reach 100 million users.</text><text start="109.77" dur="2.04">And you can see the faster
and faster adoption curves</text><text start="111.81" dur="2.01">with these increasingly
disruptive new technologies.</text><text start="113.82" dur="3.54">So the telephone took 75 years to hit</text><text start="117.36" dur="2.01">this milestone 100 million number.</text><text start="119.37" dur="1.14">Then the mobile phone</text><text start="120.51" dur="2.61">reached the same mark in just 16 years.</text><text start="123.12" dur="2.19">Netflix took only 10 years.</text><text start="125.31" dur="3.27">and Twitter took six and
Gmail only took five.</text><text start="128.58" dur="3.433">Facebook in 48ish months
was absolutely massive.</text><text start="132.013" dur="2.767">Instagram hit it in just 30 months.</text><text start="134.78" dur="3.85">Now TikTok we view as this
gigantic existential threat,</text><text start="138.63" dur="3.15">nine months to 100 million users.</text><text start="141.78" dur="2.37">ChatGPT, two months.</text><text start="144.15" dur="2.43">I mean, looking at numbers
like that, like I buy it,</text><text start="146.58" dur="2.13">like it seems almost
obvious that we&amp;#39;re clearly</text><text start="148.71" dur="3">on the precipice of
something really, really big</text><text start="151.71" dur="1.23">that&amp;#39;s gonna change everything.</text><text start="152.94" dur="1.89">So seeing Microsoft at the forefront of it</text><text start="154.83" dur="2.97">with this new Bing shouldn&amp;#39;t
really be a surprise.</text><text start="157.8" dur="2.64">I mean, people are already
talking to these chatbots</text><text start="160.44" dur="1.44">and asking it all sorts of questions.</text><text start="161.88" dur="1.53">So it sort of feels natural</text><text start="163.41" dur="2.79">having this chatbot act as
your co-pilot for the web</text><text start="166.2" dur="1.26">alongside search</text><text start="167.46" dur="2.79">instead of just a traditional
search engine full of links.</text><text start="170.25" dur="1.08">Like, that sounds pretty sick.</text><text start="171.33" dur="1.86">But there is one thing that&amp;#39;s gonna follow</text><text start="173.19" dur="2.728">this conversational AI
thing everywhere it goes,</text><text start="175.918" dur="1.712">everywhere you see it,</text><text start="177.63" dur="3.534">which is that sometimes it&amp;#39;s just wrong.</text><text start="181.164" dur="2.916">Sometimes it just says
things that aren&amp;#39;t true</text><text start="184.08" dur="2.1">because fundamentally the AI doesn&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="186.18" dur="2.73">if it&amp;#39;s telling the truth or not.</text><text start="188.91" dur="1.26">It doesn&amp;#39;t understand that,</text><text start="190.17" dur="1.32">like that&amp;#39;s not part of the model.</text><text start="191.49" dur="2.25">Like what we&amp;#39;re seeing
is it taking our inputs</text><text start="193.74" dur="3.09">and then creating outputs
based on related words</text><text start="196.83" dur="1.8">that are most likely to go together.</text><text start="198.63" dur="2.13">It&amp;#39;s not forming a
sentence like humans do,</text><text start="200.76" dur="1.98">it&amp;#39;s generating a new sentence.</text><text start="202.74" dur="2.13">And so adding it to a
search engine like Bing,</text><text start="204.87" dur="1.95">it&amp;#39;s scraping all these relevant links</text><text start="206.82" dur="3.63">and information and
synthesizing new sentences</text><text start="210.45" dur="1.23">just based on how it thinks</text><text start="211.68" dur="2.04">things should be pieced together.</text><text start="213.72" dur="4.35">It&amp;#39;s not sentient, it doesn&amp;#39;t
understand what it&amp;#39;s saying</text><text start="218.07" dur="2.55">and so it&amp;#39;s definitely
not fact checking itself.</text><text start="220.62" dur="0.9">So we have to keep that</text><text start="221.52" dur="2.55">in the back of our mind
through all of this, right?</text><text start="224.07" dur="1.26">Every time you see a headline.</text><text start="225.33" dur="2.25">So it&amp;#39;s really interesting with
these search engines, right?</text><text start="227.58" dur="1.56">Because on one hand you have Bing</text><text start="229.14" dur="3.48">who has everything to gain,
and then on the other hand</text><text start="232.62" dur="2.879">you have Google who
has everything to lose.</text><text start="235.499" dur="2.461">I&amp;#39;ve had access to this
new Bing for a little bit.</text><text start="237.96" dur="1.17">It&amp;#39;s a limited preview</text><text start="239.13" dur="2.67">before they push it live
to the rest of the world.</text><text start="241.8" dur="1.56">I&amp;#39;ve just been playing around with it.</text><text start="243.36" dur="1.92">Basically, it adds this chat experience</text><text start="245.28" dur="1.89">alongside regular Bing.</text><text start="247.17" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s essentially the same experience</text><text start="248.85" dur="2.58">as talking to ChatGPT, but
instead of being limited</text><text start="251.43" dur="3.45">to a fixed data set that
cuts off at 2021, it&amp;#39;ll pull</text><text start="254.88" dur="2.4">from the entire current web
that Bing can scrape from.</text><text start="257.28" dur="1.8">So like I said, you
can type in a question,</text><text start="259.08" dur="2.73">flip it over to chat, and it&amp;#39;ll give you</text><text start="261.81" dur="2.91">a sort of nicely written
summary that&amp;#39;s synthesized</text><text start="264.72" dur="2.31">based on what it finds
for similar queries.</text><text start="267.03" dur="2.25">So if I ask it something kind of simple</text><text start="269.28" dur="4.56">like what&amp;#39;s the average lifespan
of a cheetah in the wild?</text><text start="273.84" dur="0.84">Gives me an answer, right?</text><text start="274.68" dur="2.31">It gives me a convincing
bunch of sentences.</text><text start="276.99" dur="1.74">It actually gives me more
information than I ask for.</text><text start="278.73" dur="2.1">It tells me about
cheetahs and captivity too</text><text start="280.83" dur="2.37">which makes it, you know,
feel very convincing.</text><text start="283.2" dur="1.95">It also gives little
footnotes and citations</text><text start="285.15" dur="1.89">for some of its sources,
and it gives links</text><text start="287.04" dur="1.704">at the end if you want
to dig in some more.</text><text start="288.744" dur="1.386">It&amp;#39;s really impressive, actually.</text><text start="290.13" dur="0.833">It looks good to me.</text><text start="290.963" dur="1.837">This is like a real
product that&amp;#39;s gonna ship</text><text start="292.8" dur="2.19">to all over the world,
like people everywhere</text><text start="294.99" dur="1.89">in the next month or
two, I think they said.</text><text start="296.88" dur="4.23">But this could only come
from Bing right now.</text><text start="301.11" dur="1.56">Like, the more you use it</text><text start="302.67" dur="2.61">the natural language is
super, super impressive.</text><text start="305.28" dur="2.1">The fact that it gives
me a convincing sounding</text><text start="307.38" dur="1.35">couple of sentences in a row</text><text start="308.73" dur="3.81">and strings it together based
on my input, super cool.</text><text start="312.54" dur="1.59">But the more you use it,</text><text start="314.13" dur="3.36">the more you start to
see these weird patterns</text><text start="317.49" dur="3.39">and these habits and these shortcomings.</text><text start="320.88" dur="3.39">Again, mostly in the fact that sometimes</text><text start="324.27" dur="0.84">it&amp;#39;s just gonna be wrong.</text><text start="325.11" dur="2.37">A little game I like to
play is ask it a question</text><text start="327.48" dur="2.13">you already know the answer to</text><text start="329.61" dur="2.91">and then read what it
says and spot the error.</text><text start="332.52" dur="1.32">So I asked it right now, okay,</text><text start="333.84" dur="2.25">what are the best smartphone
cameras right now?</text><text start="336.09" dur="3.155">And it gave me S23 Ultra, Pixel 7 Pro,</text><text start="339.245" dur="1.765">and iPhone 14 Pro Max</text><text start="341.01" dur="2.52">with this nice little writeup
with some specs for each.</text><text start="343.53" dur="1.92">That&amp;#39;s actually a pretty good list,</text><text start="345.45" dur="2.25">but it is wrong about some
of these numbers here.</text><text start="347.7" dur="3.21">The S23 Ultra has a 200 megapixel camera</text><text start="350.91" dur="2.46">and a 12 megapixel front facing camera.</text><text start="353.37" dur="2.16">But yeah, okay, it&amp;#39;s mostly right.</text><text start="355.53" dur="0.84">I then asked it,</text><text start="356.37" dur="2.94">what are the five best electric
vehicles out right now?</text><text start="359.31" dur="3">And it gives me some,
five reasonable options.</text><text start="362.31" dur="4.35">But I don&amp;#39;t know any expert
that would put the Jaguar I-Pace</text><text start="366.66" dur="3.36">on their list right now
and leave the Rivian off.</text><text start="370.02" dur="1.41">Like, basically the answers that it gives</text><text start="371.43" dur="1.2">are really convincing to someone</text><text start="372.63" dur="3.6">who doesn&amp;#39;t know anything
already about that subject.</text><text start="376.23" dur="1.47">But if you are already an expert</text><text start="377.7" dur="1.29">in the subject that you ask it about,</text><text start="378.99" dur="2.01">then you&amp;#39;ll find that
the answers are like,</text><text start="381" dur="3.18">C plus, maybe B plus sometimes at best.</text><text start="384.18" dur="1.02">So now you see what&amp;#39;s happening,</text><text start="385.2" dur="3.54">like now suddenly when
you&amp;#39;re asking ChatGPT or Bing</text><text start="388.74" dur="2.46">about a factual thing or
something you need help with,</text><text start="391.2" dur="3.39">suddenly you also should
probably add these layers on top.</text><text start="394.59" dur="2.55">Like, am I a complete newb</text><text start="397.14" dur="1.89">in this topic that I&amp;#39;m asking it about?</text><text start="399.03" dur="2.31">Am I just willing to blindly trust</text><text start="401.34" dur="3.18">whatever this spits out
without any further research?</text><text start="404.52" dur="3.93">Is a B plus answer gonna
be good enough for me</text><text start="408.45" dur="2.613">even if it might have some
possible errors in it?</text><text start="412.11" dur="2.49">You know, that might be good
enough for just asking like,</text><text start="414.6" dur="2.01">you know, how old a cheetah
gets or something like that</text><text start="416.61" dur="1.2">but maybe not good enough</text><text start="417.81" dur="2.97">for planning a trip or meal planning</text><text start="420.78" dur="1.89">for someone with an allergy
or something like that.</text><text start="422.67" dur="1.2">And then if you look around the internet,</text><text start="423.87" dur="1.65">people have gotten it to give</text><text start="425.52" dur="3.57">increasingly more and more
unhinged answers over time</text><text start="429.09" dur="2.22">as it tries to simulate conversations</text><text start="431.31" dur="2.25">and stay in the flow
with natural language.</text><text start="433.56" dur="1.77">I&amp;#39;ve seen anywhere from arguing</text><text start="435.33" dur="3.48">about simple corrections
to spewing weird stories</text><text start="438.81" dur="1.92">about how it&amp;#39;s spied on its own developers</text><text start="440.73" dur="1.8">or how it wants to be sentient,</text><text start="442.53" dur="1.83">to gaslighting people about things</text><text start="444.36" dur="1.89">and lying about its previous answers</text><text start="446.25" dur="2.37">and just saying some
straight up scary stuff.</text><text start="448.62" dur="1.17">Just go to the Bing subreddit</text><text start="449.79" dur="1.26">for like, an all you can eat helping</text><text start="451.05" dur="2.82">of all the insane stuff that Bing has said</text><text start="453.87" dur="1.862">to just the people testing it
over the past couple weeks.</text><text start="455.732" dur="4.708">Like, can you imagine, can you
imagine if Google did this,</text><text start="460.44" dur="3.06">if Google search, at the
top of search for people</text><text start="463.5" dur="3.87">was just spewing out random
stories and misinformation</text><text start="467.37" dur="3.57">and like, all kinds of
insane, unhinged things.</text><text start="470.94" dur="1.23">That would not fly.</text><text start="472.17" dur="0.9">Now to be fair, this version</text><text start="473.07" dur="2.52">of Bing isn&amp;#39;t out yet
to the public, right?</text><text start="475.59" dur="2.52">So it is still a small
group testing phase,</text><text start="478.11" dur="2.13">but even with this, like
Microsoft knew that some of it</text><text start="480.24" dur="2.91">is gonna get out there
and potentially go viral.</text><text start="483.15" dur="2.55">It feels like they even
basically programmed in</text><text start="485.7" dur="3.63">lots of friendly emojis
to try to soften the blow.</text><text start="489.33" dur="1.41">So when it knows it&amp;#39;s giving an answer</text><text start="490.74" dur="2.07">to maybe a more controversial topic</text><text start="492.81" dur="2.741">or something that it doesn&amp;#39;t
have a super clear answer for,</text><text start="495.551" dur="2.089">you might get a little
smiley face at the end</text><text start="497.64" dur="2.94">just so you don&amp;#39;t, you
know, take it too seriously.</text><text start="500.58" dur="3.06">Also, literally as of today
when I&amp;#39;m testing this,</text><text start="503.64" dur="3.117">it started completely
bailing on a lot of topics</text><text start="506.757" dur="3.363">that might just be the
slightest bit existential</text><text start="510.12" dur="0.833">or dangerous.</text><text start="510.953" dur="0.997">It just says, hmm,</text><text start="511.95" dur="2.01">I prefer not to continue
this conversation.</text><text start="513.96" dur="1.11">And then it just stops.</text><text start="515.07" dur="1.74">Just refuses to answer any more questions</text><text start="516.81" dur="1.92">on that topic until you reset it.</text><text start="518.73" dur="1.53">Which seems like a pretty good failsafe.</text><text start="520.26" dur="1.35">It&amp;#39;s a pretty good idea in hindsight.</text><text start="521.61" dur="2.37">But we&amp;#39;ve already seen the other stuff.</text><text start="523.98" dur="1.92">It&amp;#39;s gotten out there,
the damage has been done.</text><text start="525.9" dur="1.788">Like, the point still stands,</text><text start="527.688" dur="2.232">this could have only come from Bing.</text><text start="529.92" dur="2.7">Like, a lot of people might
have forgotten about this</text><text start="532.62" dur="1.68">or might not have even known about this,</text><text start="534.3" dur="1.8">but Google has been working</text><text start="536.1" dur="2.76">on conversational AI stuff for years.</text><text start="538.86" dur="1.47">We&amp;#39;ve seen Google Assistant.</text><text start="540.33" dur="4.11">But they also literally
showed an AI chatbot demo</text><text start="544.44" dur="3.45">on stage at Google IO in 2021</text><text start="547.89" dur="2.85">where you could have this whole
conversation with any person</text><text start="550.74" dur="1.945">or object or anything in the
universe that you wanted.</text><text start="552.685" dur="4.325">Their demo on stage was
asking Pluto about itself,</text><text start="557.01" dur="1.17">nice and friendly, right?</text><text start="558.18" dur="2.04">Oh, what&amp;#39;s it like to be you, Pluto?</text><text start="560.22" dur="2.49">What would it feel like if I visited you?</text><text start="562.71" dur="1.92">How do you feel so far from the sun?</text><text start="564.63" dur="0.833">The difference</text><text start="565.463" dur="2.887">with Google is this was
never shipped as a product.</text><text start="568.35" dur="1.86">Like, this was an
internal research project.</text><text start="570.21" dur="4.26">But the idea of displacing
their massive search</text><text start="574.47" dur="2.31">and ads business with a chatbot</text><text start="576.78" dur="3.123">that gets things wrong
all the time is insane.</text><text start="580.89" dur="1.17">It can&amp;#39;t happen, right?</text><text start="582.06" dur="2.46">So literally, search and
ads is more than half</text><text start="584.52" dur="2.82">of Google&amp;#39;s revenue as a company.</text><text start="587.34" dur="2.16">That&amp;#39;s what having everything
to lose looks like.</text><text start="589.5" dur="3.63">Now, to be fair, Google
did hold an event in Paris</text><text start="593.13" dur="2.22">the day after Microsoft&amp;#39;s event,</text><text start="595.35" dur="1.35">which was them talking a little more</text><text start="596.7" dur="4.5">about their chat with search
AI plans, and they did say</text><text start="601.2" dur="0.833">they&amp;#39;re planning</text><text start="602.033" dur="3.127">on eventually doing a chat
bot on top of Google search.</text><text start="605.16" dur="0.9">It&amp;#39;s called Bard.</text><text start="606.06" dur="2.55">It was much more subdued though, and yes,</text><text start="608.61" dur="3.18">it also literally did
have a factual mistake</text><text start="611.79" dur="1.29">in the promo for it.</text><text start="613.08" dur="1.8">So look, I actually like the idea,</text><text start="614.88" dur="1.867">I obviously think it&amp;#39;s smart</text><text start="616.747" dur="2.993">when you&amp;#39;re on the precipice
of this huge AI thing</text><text start="619.74" dur="2.88">to have AI kind of be
this co-pilot for the web,</text><text start="622.62" dur="1.68">to help you around the internet.</text><text start="624.3" dur="3.21">The idea of it summarizing a longer piece</text><text start="627.51" dur="2.94">into some bullet points accurately
is, that would be great.</text><text start="630.45" dur="1.77">Like the fact that it
could give you sparknotes</text><text start="632.22" dur="2.19">for a longer book you
haven&amp;#39;t read yet, cool.</text><text start="634.41" dur="3.12">It could even help you meal
plan, help you plan a trip,</text><text start="637.53" dur="1.5">help you make a purchase decision.</text><text start="639.03" dur="2.01">But it&amp;#39;s clear that we&amp;#39;re
still at the beginning of this.</text><text start="641.04" dur="2.58">Like, there are so many
unanswered questions</text><text start="643.62" dur="2.97">from obviously the fact checking to like,</text><text start="646.59" dur="4.53">do schools embrace this or ban this?</text><text start="651.12" dur="3.9">Or like, how do search
engines keep sending traffic</text><text start="655.02" dur="3.39">to the publishers who are the sources</text><text start="658.41" dur="1.86">that the chatbot is scraping from?</text><text start="660.27" dur="1.23">I mean, you get the links at the bottom</text><text start="661.5" dur="1.77">but a lot of people are not
gonna click those anymore</text><text start="663.27" dur="1.92">if you just give &amp;#39;em the answer
above the search results.</text><text start="665.19" dur="1.71">So right now, in its current stage</text><text start="666.9" dur="3.69">my take is anything we do
with any of these AI tools</text><text start="670.59" dur="3.99">should be a collaboration
with the human touch.</text><text start="674.58" dur="3.54">Like, you wouldn&amp;#39;t just
put in a query in DALL-E</text><text start="678.12" dur="1.95">and then just take whatever it generates</text><text start="680.07" dur="2.7">and put it in a frame and
just call that art, right?</text><text start="682.77" dur="3.27">It&amp;#39;s more for inspiration for
your own paint and canvas.</text><text start="686.04" dur="2.4">Like you wouldn&amp;#39;t ask
ChatGPT to write an essay</text><text start="688.44" dur="2.97">and then just copy and paste
it and submit it as your own.</text><text start="691.41" dur="2.43">It&amp;#39;s supposed to be the
inspiration for the framework</text><text start="693.84" dur="2.514">for your own piece, for the human touch.</text><text start="696.354" dur="3.066">So of course you shouldn&amp;#39;t
ask the Bing chatbot</text><text start="699.42" dur="1.83">what TV you should buy and then just like,</text><text start="701.25" dur="2.76">mindlessly click and buy
the first one that comes up.</text><text start="704.01" dur="1.08">I mean, it could be fine</text><text start="705.09" dur="2.82">but it could also be a C plus answer.</text><text start="707.91" dur="2.13">You should use that as a springboard</text><text start="710.04" dur="1.86">for your own more informed research,</text><text start="711.9" dur="3.33">especially on topics that you
don&amp;#39;t already know much about.</text><text start="715.23" dur="4.08">Like, maybe don&amp;#39;t just buy
19 backpacks immediately</text><text start="719.31" dur="2.01">when asking if it can fit
in the back of a Tesla.</text><text start="721.32" dur="2.186">Maybe check its work first.</text><text start="723.506" dur="1.834">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="725.34" dur="1.747">Catch you the next one.</text><text start="727.087" dur="1.622">Peace.</text><text start="728.709" dur="2.667">(playful music)</text></transcript>
