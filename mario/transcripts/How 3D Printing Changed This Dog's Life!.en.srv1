<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="3.6" dur="0.9">- So this is Cleo</text><text start="4.5" dur="1.71">and as you can probably immediately tell,</text><text start="6.21" dur="1.74">Cleo is an awesome dog.</text><text start="7.95" dur="1.89">She&amp;#39;s one of the nicest
dogs I&amp;#39;ve ever met.</text><text start="9.84" dur="3.72">She loves people, anyone
that&amp;#39;ll give her any food.</text><text start="13.56" dur="1.86">She&amp;#39;s pretty classic dog stuff</text><text start="15.42" dur="3.48">and she also happens to
be missing her right leg.</text><text start="18.9" dur="2.31">She was found on Petfinder
after she spent some time</text><text start="21.21" dur="3.27">as a stray in Oklahoma with
injuries from unknown causes.</text><text start="24.48" dur="1.98">Now hanging out with Cleo
and just playing with her,</text><text start="26.46" dur="2.13">like you&amp;#39;d almost forget,
like you wouldn&amp;#39;t even know</text><text start="28.59" dur="1.89">that she&amp;#39;s missing a leg &amp;#39;cause
she&amp;#39;s just running around,</text><text start="30.48" dur="1.65">chasing stuff, playing fetch,</text><text start="32.13" dur="3.78">she loves being outdoors,
all that classic dog stuff.</text><text start="35.91" dur="3.12">But although she appears
super healthy now,</text><text start="39.03" dur="1.41">dogs that are missing limbs</text><text start="40.44" dur="1.53">and any pets that are missing limbs</text><text start="41.97" dur="3.21">are actually more likely to
have things like arthritis</text><text start="45.18" dur="2.82">and joint problems in their
other limbs later in life</text><text start="48" dur="2.13">&amp;#39;cause they&amp;#39;re compensating
for the missing limb.</text><text start="50.13" dur="2.04">So she&amp;#39;s running around being awesome now,</text><text start="52.17" dur="4.44">but it would be ideal for
her long term to be supported</text><text start="56.61" dur="2.85">so that&amp;#39;s where this company
called 3D Pets comes in.</text><text start="59.46" dur="1.2">So they reached out and
they were telling me</text><text start="60.66" dur="2.4">they have a particularly
high tech solution</text><text start="63.06" dur="3.03">to the problem and asked if
I basically want to go see it</text><text start="66.09" dur="2.91">and it turns out it is pretty sick.</text><text start="69" dur="1.11">I mean, I&amp;#39;ve already
talked about this before,</text><text start="70.11" dur="1.8">but there&amp;#39;s tech in everything.</text><text start="71.91" dur="2.07">Like every story, every
angle, everything I see</text><text start="73.98" dur="2.55">on the news nowadays,
it has some tech in it,</text><text start="76.53" dur="1.59">but even this story surprised me at just</text><text start="78.12" dur="4.143">how much tech was involved
in helping dogs like Cleo.</text><text start="84.81" dur="1.86">So it&amp;#39;s this multi-step process.</text><text start="86.67" dur="2.46">First up is this scan.</text><text start="89.13" dur="2.52">So the pet comes into their studio,</text><text start="91.65" dur="1.23">which is actually in New Jersey,</text><text start="92.88" dur="2.01">pretty close to our video studio</text><text start="94.89" dur="2.13">and they actually use a smartphone</text><text start="97.02" dur="2.34">to 3D scan the animal.</text><text start="99.36" dur="1.65">So the idea is to take a few scans,</text><text start="101.01" dur="2.46">they actually use the
iPhone&amp;#39;s LIDAR scanner</text><text start="103.47" dur="3.12">or use the true depth
camera system or both.</text><text start="106.59" dur="2.34">This isn&amp;#39;t exactly what
they were designed for,</text><text start="108.93" dur="3.21">but with apps like combed and hedges,</text><text start="112.14" dur="3.09">it is a pretty clever solution
for just basic measuring.</text><text start="115.23" dur="1.47">So basically once you get Cleo</text><text start="116.7" dur="1.873">to hold still for long enough,</text><text start="118.573" dur="1.697">you can get a pretty
decently accurate scan</text><text start="120.27" dur="1.44">of her dimensions.</text><text start="121.71" dur="1.62">How high off the ground she is,</text><text start="123.33" dur="2.64">how far around, the
shape of the prosthesis,</text><text start="125.97" dur="1.74">what that needs to be, et cetera</text><text start="127.71" dur="2.43">and all of this is to be
used in the next step,</text><text start="130.14" dur="4.11">which is 3D printing the
prosthesis, it&amp;#39;s crazy.</text><text start="134.25" dur="1.29">Now you might be thinking</text><text start="135.54" dur="1.98">like I was at the beginning
of this, wait a second,</text><text start="137.52" dur="4.05">why is there so much tech
being used in this process?</text><text start="141.57" dur="2.49">Like why is it 3D scanning the animal</text><text start="144.06" dur="2.61">and then 3D printing the prosthesis?</text><text start="146.67" dur="1.38">What&amp;#39;s going on here?</text><text start="148.05" dur="0.99">And the real answer</text><text start="149.04" dur="2.37">as they explained it to
me basically is because</text><text start="151.41" dur="4.86">every single animal&amp;#39;s situation
is a little bit different.</text><text start="156.27" dur="1.59">No two are exactly the same</text><text start="157.86" dur="2.13">whether it&amp;#39;s the reason
that they lost the limb</text><text start="159.99" dur="1.14">or part of the limb,</text><text start="161.13" dur="2.79">but then just like the size of
the animal, how big are they?</text><text start="163.92" dur="2.73">How far off the ground does the limb end?</text><text start="166.65" dur="1.74">How much weight are they
gonna be able to put on it?</text><text start="168.39" dur="2.1">All these different things
are slightly different</text><text start="170.49" dur="2.4">for every single animal, it&amp;#39;s
kind of like a fingerprint.</text><text start="172.89" dur="2.58">So clearly you can&amp;#39;t just mass produce</text><text start="175.47" dur="2.01">like one size fits all prosthetic.</text><text start="177.48" dur="1.17">Obviously even with humans,</text><text start="178.65" dur="1.26">you know this is is already true,</text><text start="179.91" dur="3.51">but the idea is you want it
to be as custom and bespoke</text><text start="183.42" dur="2.82">and comfortable for every
single animal as possible</text><text start="186.24" dur="2.31">so this 3D printing process allows</text><text start="188.55" dur="3.15">for rapid reiteration and making
a couple different versions</text><text start="191.7" dur="1.26">till you get it exactly right</text><text start="192.96" dur="2.37">and so this is why
they&amp;#39;re doing it this way.</text><text start="195.33" dur="1.71">3D pets in particular, they&amp;#39;ve worked with</text><text start="197.04" dur="3.18">over 300 different animals
so far at their studio.</text><text start="200.22" dur="2.85">They actually start with a
candidacy form on their website.</text><text start="203.07" dur="2.37">But then once they get going,
they have a ton of options.</text><text start="205.44" dur="3.3">To date, they&amp;#39;ve done many dogs as pets,</text><text start="208.74" dur="4.41">but also some ducks, a tortoise, a pig.</text><text start="213.15" dur="2.34">They had a goat recently that
was missing part of its skull</text><text start="215.49" dur="2.73">that didn&amp;#39;t form properly and
goats like to use their heads</text><text start="218.22" dur="0.833">for stuff obviously</text><text start="219.053" dur="4.657">so they made a helmet for him
and one elephant leg recently.</text><text start="223.71" dur="2.46">So anyway, Cleo&amp;#39;s scan
pretty straightforward</text><text start="226.17" dur="1.56">and within five minutes they have a couple</text><text start="227.73" dur="1.56">decently accurate models to work with</text><text start="229.29" dur="2.1">and then they import it into the computer</text><text start="231.39" dur="1.17">to move to step two.</text><text start="232.56" dur="2.85">So how do you get the scan off the phone?</text><text start="235.41" dur="1.68">- Well that&amp;#39;s the easy part.</text><text start="237.09" dur="3.423">We get the scan off the
phone onto our web portal,</text><text start="241.47" dur="0.84">which we&amp;#39;re able to bring</text><text start="242.31" dur="2.61">into a custom design software here</text><text start="244.92" dur="2.13">where that&amp;#39;s really
where the magic happens,</text><text start="247.05" dur="2.73">where we&amp;#39;re able to take a design</text><text start="249.78" dur="2.91">and really mold it to
the 3D scan of each pet</text><text start="252.69" dur="2.4">so that we can make sure
everything&amp;#39;s fitting perfect.</text><text start="255.09" dur="2.31">- So this is Cleo&amp;#39;s scan,</text><text start="257.4" dur="4.5">and the appropriate fit as it
would be built on the scan?</text><text start="261.9" dur="2.58">- Right, so you can see the scan overlaid</text><text start="264.48" dur="1.92">and we can patch things up as needed.</text><text start="266.4" dur="1.89">It&amp;#39;s almost like 3D Photoshop in a way,</text><text start="268.29" dur="3.12">but then we&amp;#39;re able to
control the lattice,</text><text start="271.41" dur="1.83">the hardware mounts, where the straps go,</text><text start="273.24" dur="2.55">we can really position
everything perfect to each pet.</text><text start="275.79" dur="2.25">And then once we&amp;#39;re happy, once it&amp;#39;s set,</text><text start="278.04" dur="2.31">then we bring it into another software</text><text start="280.35" dur="2.27">where this is where we
optimize it for printing.</text><text start="282.62" dur="2.29">So we have to be able to basically</text><text start="284.91" dur="2.4">give the printer
instruction on what to make.</text><text start="287.31" dur="2.61">So this is where we really fine tune</text><text start="289.92" dur="3.48">the intricacies and the
detail of each layer</text><text start="293.4" dur="2.25">&amp;#39;cause again, we want
some areas to be nice</text><text start="295.65" dur="2.46">and rigid where hardware
mounts, for example.</text><text start="298.11" dur="3.87">But like around the rib
cage, around the lungs,</text><text start="301.98" dur="1.5">we want the flexibility</text><text start="303.48" dur="2.64">so you can see we don&amp;#39;t have
that thick lattice there.</text><text start="306.12" dur="2.64">This over here, these wings
we can really easily bend</text><text start="308.76" dur="1.8">even if the dog fluctuates in weight,</text><text start="310.56" dur="3.69">we want it to accommodate those changes.</text><text start="314.25" dur="3.78">But where the mount is, where
the hardware is on this end,</text><text start="318.03" dur="2.46">this we want to be
really sturdy and strong</text><text start="320.49" dur="1.62">&amp;#39;cause that&amp;#39;s where the impact is.</text><text start="322.11" dur="2.1">So once we&amp;#39;re happy with
this, once it&amp;#39;s ready to go,</text><text start="324.21" dur="2.01">we&amp;#39;ll take it over to
one of the 3D printers</text><text start="326.22" dur="1.8">and we have a whole
bunch of different sizes</text><text start="328.02" dur="2.82">depending on the case,
depending on the animal,</text><text start="330.84" dur="1.77">but they&amp;#39;re all pretty
similar in how they work.</text><text start="332.61" dur="3.48">- So 3D printing, to be perfectly honest,</text><text start="336.09" dur="2.46">I never really cared that
much about 3D printing.</text><text start="338.55" dur="1.05">This is like a confession.</text><text start="339.6" dur="1.8">Like I never...</text><text start="341.4" dur="1.17">There was a ton of hype about it</text><text start="342.57" dur="1.62">and obviously a lot of
people care a lot about it,</text><text start="344.19" dur="1.2">but every time I was brought up to me,</text><text start="345.39" dur="2.13">I couldn&amp;#39;t really find a reason to care</text><text start="347.52" dur="1.77">and we got a 3D printer at the studio</text><text start="349.29" dur="3.42">and we&amp;#39;ve printed a couple
random trinkets here and there,</text><text start="352.71" dur="1.89">mostly things that are
just like useless stuff</text><text start="354.6" dur="1.98">just to see if it&amp;#39;ll work.</text><text start="356.58" dur="1.86">Whatever, neat, but this is the first time</text><text start="358.44" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;ve seen a situation where
3D printing clearly makes</text><text start="361.92" dur="2.67">the most sense for a
manufacturing process.</text><text start="364.59" dur="2.7">Obviously you can&amp;#39;t do one single mold,</text><text start="367.29" dur="2.01">you can&amp;#39;t do one size fits all</text><text start="369.3" dur="1.41">so like I said,</text><text start="370.71" dur="3.12">it just made the most sense for once.</text><text start="373.83" dur="1.71">They have a couple different
size printers in here</text><text start="375.54" dur="2.46">ranging from something like an Anker M5,</text><text start="378" dur="1.5">something you might buy on Amazon</text><text start="379.5" dur="2.07">all the way up to an industrial sized one,</text><text start="381.57" dur="2.58">the size of a refrigerator,
basically to work</text><text start="384.15" dur="2.7">on different sized pieces
for different animals.</text><text start="386.85" dur="2.34">So once they were happy with Cleo&amp;#39;s design</text><text start="389.19" dur="3.6">of the prosthesis in the
software, it hits the printer</text><text start="392.79" dur="3.51">and about literally 24
hours later, it&amp;#39;s done,</text><text start="396.3" dur="1.53">it&amp;#39;s printed, the whole thing.</text><text start="397.83" dur="1.53">Now this isn&amp;#39;t the final step for hers.</text><text start="399.36" dur="3.21">There is still a sanding down
process to soften the corners</text><text start="402.57" dur="2.22">and make it as comfortable as possible</text><text start="404.79" dur="1.32">and also in 3D printing,</text><text start="406.11" dur="3.21">there&amp;#39;s commonly these
support pieces that you get</text><text start="409.32" dur="3.15">when you print oddly shaped
objects that need to be cut off</text><text start="412.47" dur="2.16">and they&amp;#39;re actually working
on ways to melt that down</text><text start="414.63" dur="2.37">and use it in other
things like wheels or feet</text><text start="417" dur="2.58">so they can actually be
resourceful about that as well,</text><text start="419.58" dur="3">but they&amp;#39;ve showed me a bunch
of examples of various shapes</text><text start="422.58" dur="2.82">and sizes of things they&amp;#39;ve
printed for animals in the past.</text><text start="425.4" dur="2.22">- So this one is just
about ready to ship out.</text><text start="427.62" dur="2.07">This dog has a residual limb.</text><text start="429.69" dur="2.52">So we have this build out
here and we do it like this</text><text start="432.21" dur="2.07">so that we can keep
the weight bearing load</text><text start="434.28" dur="2.4">right below where the limb used to be.</text><text start="436.68" dur="1.71">If we have it in any other place,</text><text start="438.39" dur="1.59">they just won&amp;#39;t be able to walk correctly.</text><text start="439.98" dur="1.8">- And this is also now softened down</text><text start="441.78" dur="2.64">and it is just sanded, basically?</text><text start="444.42" dur="1.92">- We do a sand and torch.</text><text start="446.34" dur="2.19">So we&amp;#39;ll basically burn the material back</text><text start="448.53" dur="1.8">like what the machine
is doing, heating it up</text><text start="450.33" dur="2.67">to a melting temperature,
it smooths it out.</text><text start="453" dur="2.42">And something that we&amp;#39;re
very well known for</text><text start="455.42" dur="1.48">with our devices are our feet.</text><text start="456.9" dur="2.19">And so one of the biggest
things is when the dogs</text><text start="459.09" dur="2.64">are taking steps, you want that
foot to be able to compress</text><text start="461.73" dur="0.843">to absorb that.</text><text start="463.44" dur="0.833">I&amp;#39;ll trade you.</text><text start="466.32" dur="3.48">I think this is version
like five or six of the foot</text><text start="469.8" dur="2.22">and we&amp;#39;re on version like
10 or 12 of the harness</text><text start="472.02" dur="2.55">so they&amp;#39;re constantly
changing and adapting.</text><text start="474.57" dur="1.65">If somebody reaches
out to us and they say,</text><text start="476.22" dur="2.55">I burned through a foot,
here are the reasons why,</text><text start="478.77" dur="1.17">we&amp;#39;re gonna make the changes to the foot</text><text start="479.94" dur="1.41">so that stops happening.</text><text start="481.35" dur="1.59">And so that&amp;#39;s why we go
through our variations.</text><text start="482.94" dur="2.55">We&amp;#39;re actually working on
the next version of the foot,</text><text start="485.49" dur="2.31">which has rounder edges</text><text start="487.8" dur="1.62">so more of a radius on these edges.</text><text start="489.42" dur="1.773">- Like a tire maybe?</text><text start="491.193" dur="0.833">- Yeah, yeah, exactly like a tire</text><text start="492.026" dur="2.404">because dogs tend to lean
on one side or the other</text><text start="494.43" dur="1.5">and we&amp;#39;ll typically have
the owners flip it around</text><text start="495.93" dur="1.47">once they start to wear on one side</text><text start="497.4" dur="1.38">so it wears evenly.</text><text start="498.78" dur="1.513">- A tire rotation?</text><text start="500.293" dur="1.637">- Exactly, a foot rotation.</text><text start="501.93" dur="1.74">And then behind you, we
have some of our carts</text><text start="503.67" dur="2.07">that are in process too.</text><text start="505.74" dur="3.84">So this is one going
down to a dog in Texas.</text><text start="509.58" dur="2.01">She&amp;#39;s got two deformed limbs.</text><text start="511.59" dur="1.65">In fact one is really not formed at all,</text><text start="513.24" dur="2.07">but she&amp;#39;s got one deformed
here on the left hand side.</text><text start="515.31" dur="1.44">So we make provisions for that</text><text start="516.75" dur="2.55">so that the shoulders
can still move around.</text><text start="519.3" dur="3">So this&amp;#39;ll get three six
inch wheels on each corner.</text><text start="522.3" dur="2.34">And then this, this is
another good example.</text><text start="524.64" dur="3.96">This is for a dachshund that
has one full remaining leg</text><text start="528.6" dur="2.22">and had a partial amputation.</text><text start="530.82" dur="2.97">And so the owners didn&amp;#39;t want
something extremely bulky,</text><text start="533.79" dur="2.1">but they wanted that
front leg to have support</text><text start="535.89" dur="2.43">&amp;#39;cause dachshunds have
a lot of back problems.</text><text start="538.32" dur="3">So we designed this
specifically for this case</text><text start="541.32" dur="2.94">where the dachshund can
put its legs and move it</text><text start="544.26" dur="1.95">and still have the
support on the outer edges</text><text start="546.21" dur="2.2">and we still have our
flexible harness here.</text><text start="549.45" dur="3.6">And the wheels can
change camber as well too</text><text start="553.05" dur="1.902">so depending on--</text><text start="554.952" dur="1.083">- Sport mode.</text><text start="557.25" dur="2.79">- And we&amp;#39;ll go up to
eight or 10 inch wheels.</text><text start="560.04" dur="1.56">I think you saw this one.</text><text start="561.6" dur="1.203">- That Escalade dogs.</text><text start="564.45" dur="1.44">- We should do spinners
on one of these rooms</text><text start="565.89" dur="1.35">one of these days honestly.</text><text start="569.01" dur="1.89">I haven&amp;#39;t put it past people.</text><text start="570.9" dur="2.61">The woman that we did our
original dachshund cart for,</text><text start="573.51" dur="1.74">she saw our black wheels and she was like,</text><text start="575.25" dur="1.86">I&amp;#39;d like silver rims, please,</text><text start="577.11" dur="1.35">and I thought she was joking.</text><text start="578.46" dur="1.618">I totally thought she was joking</text><text start="580.078" dur="0.842">and I was like, oh, that&amp;#39;s a cool idea.</text><text start="580.92" dur="2.25">She was like, no, really
I want silver wheels.</text><text start="583.17" dur="1.44">- Would you paint it or would you--</text><text start="584.61" dur="1.17">- We ended up painting it.</text><text start="585.78" dur="1.173">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</text><text start="587.825" dur="1.885">- So, Cleo&amp;#39;s scan was pretty good.</text><text start="589.71" dur="1.35">Then they designed her prosthesis</text><text start="591.06" dur="2.34">around that scan, that went great.</text><text start="593.4" dur="2.64">Then they printed it, sanded
it, and torched it down</text><text start="596.04" dur="2.52">and matched it with
the leg for her height.</text><text start="598.56" dur="3.66">The only step left now
is to see how it works.</text><text start="602.22" dur="1.65">So what I kind of didn&amp;#39;t realize is</text><text start="603.87" dur="2.43">it&amp;#39;s not just like you attach
the prosthesis to the dog</text><text start="606.3" dur="2.22">and then they just magically
start running around perfectly</text><text start="608.52" dur="1.32">like they&amp;#39;ve had it their whole life.</text><text start="609.84" dur="1.98">But no, like anyone who&amp;#39;s
had crutches knows this,</text><text start="611.82" dur="2.28">there&amp;#39;s actually an adjustment process</text><text start="614.1" dur="2.4">as you get more and more used to it.</text><text start="616.5" dur="3.57">So I got to watch Cleo
sort of learn in real time</text><text start="620.07" dur="2.76">even in just these few
minutes, go from hovering it</text><text start="622.83" dur="3.09">off the ground to eventually
starting to trust it.</text><text start="625.92" dur="2.52">And the process of them getting used to it</text><text start="628.44" dur="2.1">depending on the pet is
basically to introduce them</text><text start="630.54" dur="2.1">to more and more time per day with it</text><text start="632.64" dur="2.43">so that they eventually get
used to totally living with it.</text><text start="635.07" dur="2.13">Maybe 20 minutes a day at the beginning,</text><text start="637.2" dur="2.73">then it&amp;#39;s an hour a day,
then two hours a day</text><text start="639.93" dur="2.49">and you slowly see them start
to remap their muscle memory</text><text start="642.42" dur="2.55">and unlearn walking without the limb</text><text start="644.97" dur="2.19">and really trust it and
depend on it by the end.</text><text start="647.16" dur="2.19">So at the end of the day, I
thought this was super cool</text><text start="649.35" dur="4.2">and basically it&amp;#39;s a huge
win for pets like Cleo</text><text start="653.55" dur="1.68">and it&amp;#39;s also super cool</text><text start="655.23" dur="2.97">that it&amp;#39;s enabled by tech that
feels relatively accessible,</text><text start="658.2" dur="3.06">like a phone in our
pocket, a computer app,</text><text start="661.26" dur="2.25">one or two pieces of
software and then 3D printers</text><text start="663.51" dur="2.52">like all things that we
can get started with,</text><text start="666.03" dur="2.76">that&amp;#39;s how they got started
with building this studio</text><text start="668.79" dur="2.16">in New Jersey and actually
helping so many pets</text><text start="670.95" dur="1.95">and they actually now will
continue to evolve this.</text><text start="672.9" dur="1.56">There&amp;#39;s other places around the country</text><text start="674.46" dur="1.59">in the world doing the same sort of thing,</text><text start="676.05" dur="4.62">but they potentially
can do remote creations</text><text start="680.67" dur="1.68">for pets that don&amp;#39;t come to the studio</text><text start="682.35" dur="2.25">but they get to like send a mold in</text><text start="684.6" dur="1.98">and then build a prosthesis
for other animals</text><text start="686.58" dur="1.47">they don&amp;#39;t even get to see.</text><text start="688.05" dur="1.32">I&amp;#39;m not even gonna pretend to be an expert</text><text start="689.37" dur="2.25">on 3D printing or prosthesis,</text><text start="691.62" dur="2.97">but like hopefully this helps more animals</text><text start="694.59" dur="4.29">sort of extend their
lives and live more freely</text><text start="698.88" dur="0.93">I think is the right word.</text><text start="699.81" dur="1.23">These pieces are typically priced</text><text start="701.04" dur="4.14">from a couple 100 bucks
to up to 1,000 or $2,000</text><text start="705.18" dur="3.03">and ideally will last a lifetime</text><text start="708.21" dur="1.77">at least if they&amp;#39;ve stopped growing.</text><text start="709.98" dur="0.99">So thanks to 3D Pets</text><text start="710.97" dur="1.71">for letting me pull back
the curtain a little bit</text><text start="712.68" dur="2.76">into how they use tech to do what they do.</text><text start="715.44" dur="2.31">Thanks to Cleo for letting
me hang out all day</text><text start="717.75" dur="3">and thanks to you for watching.</text><text start="720.75" dur="1.863">See you in the next one, peace.</text></transcript>
