<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.03" dur="3.257">- Okay, so this is the TCL 40 NXTPAPER,</text><text start="3.287" dur="1.843">and at first glance, it might not appear</text><text start="5.13" dur="1.53">to be a particularly special phone.</text><text start="6.66" dur="2.73">Like, this is a $200 budget Android phone.</text><text start="9.39" dur="2.25">It&amp;#39;s got a 5000 milliamp power battery,</text><text start="11.64" dur="3.03">a pretty standard issue
50 megapixel main camera</text><text start="14.67" dur="1.68">flanked by a 5 megapixel ultrawide</text><text start="16.35" dur="1.32">and a two megapixel macro,</text><text start="17.67" dur="3.87">and inside, a Mediatek G88
processor, 8 gigs of RAM,</text><text start="21.54" dur="1.59">and 256 gigs of storage.</text><text start="23.13" dur="1.59">This design is pretty basic.</text><text start="24.72" dur="1.89">It&amp;#39;s squared up, nothing too offensive,</text><text start="26.61" dur="2.28">a solid blue color with
some sparkles in it,</text><text start="28.89" dur="2.88">but it has exactly one
really interesting feature</text><text start="31.77" dur="1.8">that&amp;#39;s caught my attention,</text><text start="33.57" dur="0.96">and that&amp;#39;s the screen.</text><text start="34.53" dur="3.69">So this screen, you&amp;#39;re
looking at a 6.78 inch,</text><text start="38.22" dur="2.82">flat, 1080p, 90 hertz display,</text><text start="41.04" dur="2.49">but when you put it up
next to another phone,</text><text start="43.53" dur="1.32">that&amp;#39;s when you immediately notice</text><text start="44.85" dur="1.74">something is very different about it,</text><text start="46.59" dur="4.38">mainly that there are no
reflections at all, none,</text><text start="50.97" dur="1.02">well, almost none,</text><text start="51.99" dur="1.44">so this phone is called the NXTPAPER</text><text start="53.43" dur="1.65">because it has what TCL is calling</text><text start="55.08" dur="4.53">a full-color electronic paper display</text><text start="59.61" dur="4.83">to deliver a reflection-free, full-color,</text><text start="64.44" dur="2.04">paper-like visual experience,</text><text start="66.48" dur="1.89">which looks way better,</text><text start="68.37" dur="2.22">has much less fatigue on the eyes,</text><text start="70.59" dur="2.52">and also feels better in the hand.</text><text start="73.11" dur="1.35">And so my first thought,
when I first saw this,</text><text start="74.46" dur="3.12">was, okay, why doesn&amp;#39;t
every phone have this?</text><text start="77.58" dur="3.21">Like, how is it a super cheap budget phone</text><text start="80.79" dur="2.4">that&amp;#39;s the first one I&amp;#39;ve
seen to pull this off,</text><text start="83.19" dur="2.52">and why aren&amp;#39;t more phones doing this?</text><text start="85.71" dur="1.56">What am I missing here?</text><text start="87.27" dur="3.037">And so of course, I had to use
it to get all these answers.</text><text start="90.307" dur="2.933">So, okay, TCL calls it the NXTPAPER</text><text start="93.24" dur="1.2">because they&amp;#39;d like you to think of it</text><text start="94.44" dur="2.22">as just like an e-paper display.</text><text start="96.66" dur="1.65">If you&amp;#39;ve ever seen a Kindle</text><text start="98.31" dur="2.64">or any of the other various
E Ink displays out there,</text><text start="100.95" dur="2.85">that tech is actually
kinda sick, it&amp;#39;s amazing.</text><text start="103.8" dur="2.13">It minimizes fatigue on the eyes,</text><text start="105.93" dur="2.91">and it looks and feels like
something&amp;#39;s literally printed</text><text start="108.84" dur="2.67">on a piece of paper, like an
newspaper, in front of you.</text><text start="111.51" dur="1.8">It works great in all
sorts of different lighting</text><text start="113.31" dur="3.15">because it&amp;#39;s literally
rearranging actual ink</text><text start="116.46" dur="1.11">underneath the display.</text><text start="117.57" dur="3.12">But this is actually not that.</text><text start="120.69" dur="3.54">Instead, it&amp;#39;s an LCD display
with a textured glass on top</text><text start="124.23" dur="4.44">and some software tricks to
resemble a paper-like display</text><text start="128.67" dur="3.12">and deliver almost all of
the eye comfort benefits</text><text start="131.79" dur="0.833">that come with it,</text><text start="132.623" dur="2.377">so the result is basically</text><text start="135" dur="1.62">what looks like a normal smartphone screen</text><text start="136.62" dur="1.11">with zero reflections,</text><text start="137.73" dur="2.37">and I am very into that.</text><text start="140.1" dur="1.11">Like, look at this screen</text><text start="141.21" dur="3.63">next to a glossy regular
smartphone glass screen.</text><text start="144.84" dur="1.41">Typically, when I review phones,</text><text start="146.25" dur="1.62">like, I have to spend a lot of effort</text><text start="147.87" dur="2.46">shielding these displays from reflections.</text><text start="150.33" dur="1.65">That&amp;#39;s a little known fact in this,</text><text start="151.98" dur="1.35">I guess it&amp;#39;s kinda inside baseball,</text><text start="153.33" dur="2.37">but when you shoot reflective
things, it is a challenge.</text><text start="155.7" dur="1.65">I have to angle the phone certain ways,</text><text start="157.35" dur="1.89">I have to shoot in certain environments,</text><text start="159.24" dur="2.7">and I often use what we call a flag here,</text><text start="161.94" dur="2.7">which is literally just to
slide it in at a certain angle</text><text start="164.64" dur="3.6">to block reflections and make
the screen easier to see.</text><text start="168.24" dur="0.833">It&amp;#39;s a whole thing.</text><text start="169.073" dur="1.267">But with this matte display,</text><text start="170.34" dur="2.73">I mean, I just don&amp;#39;t need any
of that special treatment,</text><text start="173.07" dur="2.13">like, it&amp;#39;s happy to show up at any angle,</text><text start="175.2" dur="2.61">and the angles that would
normally have a giant reflection,</text><text start="177.81" dur="2.07">it just kinda looks a little bit lighter,</text><text start="179.88" dur="2.91">a little faded, but
still actually readable,</text><text start="182.79" dur="1.08">and then when you&amp;#39;re straight on,</text><text start="183.87" dur="1.83">or just kinda regularly reading,</text><text start="185.7" dur="2.73">it&amp;#39;s nice and soft, and it&amp;#39;s
less stressful on the eyes.</text><text start="188.43" dur="3.27">It is kinda weirdly a
little bit paper-like,</text><text start="191.7" dur="1.83">like some of those paper-like displays.</text><text start="193.53" dur="3.24">So almost all of this
is enabled by hardware,</text><text start="196.77" dur="1.98">so there are a bunch of extra layers</text><text start="198.75" dur="3.81">between the actual LCD display and you,</text><text start="202.56" dur="1.74">including this textured glass,</text><text start="204.3" dur="4.08">and so that&amp;#39;s all what gives
it this anti-reflective look.</text><text start="208.38" dur="1.11">There&amp;#39;s also some other benefits,</text><text start="209.49" dur="2.88">like physically limiting
the amount of blue light</text><text start="212.37" dur="0.833">that makes it through,</text><text start="213.203" dur="1.597">so instead of a special
mode in the software,</text><text start="214.8" dur="2.13">there is just physically less blue light</text><text start="216.93" dur="1.98">making it through an additional filter</text><text start="218.91" dur="0.833">into your eyes.</text><text start="219.743" dur="1.987">And another underrated one, the feel.</text><text start="221.73" dur="2.58">I mean, literally, the way the glass feels</text><text start="224.31" dur="0.96">under your finger.</text><text start="225.27" dur="2.61">It kinda has this soft touch effect</text><text start="227.88" dur="1.29">thanks to the slight texture.</text><text start="229.17" dur="1.44">So you can actually see the difference</text><text start="230.61" dur="1.17">up at the cutout at the top.</text><text start="231.78" dur="1.74">You obviously can&amp;#39;t do textured glass</text><text start="233.52" dur="1.26">over the front-facing camera,</text><text start="234.78" dur="1.89">because that would ruin the photos,</text><text start="236.67" dur="2.01">not that they&amp;#39;re amazing
photos in the first place,</text><text start="238.68" dur="1.53">but that&amp;#39;s the most obvious spot</text><text start="240.21" dur="1.23">where you can see that difference</text><text start="241.44" dur="3.21">between the matte finish and glossy glass.</text><text start="244.65" dur="2.58">And my finger just runs over this glass</text><text start="247.23" dur="3.287">almost the same way that it
does on the back of the phone.</text><text start="250.517" dur="2.975">(rubbing with no sound)</text><text start="253.492" dur="2.678">(rubbing creates swishing)</text><text start="256.17" dur="3.84">So I think all this is
shaping up to be pretty cool,</text><text start="260.01" dur="3.81">the matte finish, the
basically zero reflections,</text><text start="263.82" dur="3.72">the much lower eye strain,
the soft touch finish.</text><text start="267.54" dur="1.26">There&amp;#39;s also stylus support,</text><text start="268.8" dur="1.41">as TCL makes a stylus</text><text start="270.21" dur="1.62">that actually works with
this type of screen.</text><text start="271.83" dur="1.74">So what&amp;#39;s the catch?</text><text start="273.57" dur="3.693">Why don&amp;#39;t more phones have this on them?</text><text start="278.34" dur="2.16">And you&amp;#39;re probably one
step ahead of me already,</text><text start="280.5" dur="2.4">which is, yeah, there are some downsides.</text><text start="282.9" dur="0.833">So first of all,</text><text start="283.733" dur="2.107">a bunch of extra layers
on the display itself</text><text start="285.84" dur="1.32">is gonna have some obvious drawbacks,</text><text start="287.16" dur="2.64">but mainly, it&amp;#39;s just that
they&amp;#39;re cutting a lot of light,</text><text start="289.8" dur="2.13">like, it hurts a lot of sharpness</text><text start="291.93" dur="1.47">and just total light
getting through to you.</text><text start="293.4" dur="3.18">So this is the absolute
maximum 100% brightness</text><text start="296.58" dur="0.84">of this screen,</text><text start="297.42" dur="1.56">and it&amp;#39;s 450 nits,</text><text start="298.98" dur="2.94">so it&amp;#39;s good enough to read
indoors, as you&amp;#39;ve seen,</text><text start="301.92" dur="2.73">but outdoors, it&amp;#39;s gonna get
pretty quickly washed out</text><text start="304.65" dur="1.5">and is disappointingly dim.</text><text start="306.15" dur="1.83">Now, again, this is a $200 phone,</text><text start="307.98" dur="2.64">so I think if this was
an even higher-end phone</text><text start="310.62" dur="2.46">with a brighter LCD or an OLED back there,</text><text start="313.08" dur="2.58">maybe it could solve or
help some of these issues,</text><text start="315.66" dur="3.09">but that wouldn&amp;#39;t fix the
other one, which is sharpness.</text><text start="318.75" dur="2.55">So this is a 1080p display, as I&amp;#39;ve said,</text><text start="321.3" dur="2.04">but it doesn&amp;#39;t even really look like that.</text><text start="323.34" dur="1.2">I mean, I think if I asked you</text><text start="324.54" dur="1.62">what resolution you think this is,</text><text start="326.16" dur="1.29">or if I did a blind test or something,</text><text start="327.45" dur="3.06">it would compare pretty
closely to a 720p display.</text><text start="330.51" dur="2.82">I mean, text is soft,
edges of things are soft,</text><text start="333.33" dur="1.02">all the corners are soft.</text><text start="334.35" dur="2.16">It just all kinda has a little
bit of a glow to the edges,</text><text start="336.51" dur="2.52">which, again, makes things
nice and easy to look at,</text><text start="339.03" dur="1.89">like nothing is harsh, or super bright,</text><text start="340.92" dur="1.05">or fatiguing on the eyes,</text><text start="341.97" dur="2.82">but if it&amp;#39;s a sharp photo or
a video detail you&amp;#39;re after,</text><text start="344.79" dur="1.17">then putting a bunch of layers</text><text start="345.96" dur="1.89">between your eyeballs
and the actual display</text><text start="347.85" dur="2.07">is not the best way to see those details.</text><text start="349.92" dur="1.11">And then same thing with contrast.</text><text start="351.03" dur="2.1">Just because of how much
brightness is limited,</text><text start="353.13" dur="2.28">the lack of contrast
becomes really obvious.</text><text start="355.41" dur="2.94">This one&amp;#39;s rated at just
1500:1 contrast ratio,</text><text start="358.35" dur="2.46">which, even when compared
to other budget phones,</text><text start="360.81" dur="0.833">is not that great.</text><text start="361.643" dur="1.117">Oh, and then screen protectors.</text><text start="362.76" dur="1.74">People usually put screen
protectors on their phones,</text><text start="364.5" dur="2.64">and this one would
obviously not make sense</text><text start="367.14" dur="1.35">to put a screen protector on (chuckling).</text><text start="368.49" dur="2.7">So suddenly, in this world
of feature-rich smartphones</text><text start="371.19" dur="2.13">with all these big,
bright, clear displays,</text><text start="373.32" dur="1.56">this goes from being an advantage</text><text start="374.88" dur="2.28">to being a niche feature (chuckles),</text><text start="377.16" dur="2.13">because most people aren&amp;#39;t willing</text><text start="379.29" dur="1.68">to sacrifice the downsides</text><text start="380.97" dur="2.43">that come with maybe a
little bit less eye strain</text><text start="383.4" dur="1.17">and less reflections</text><text start="384.57" dur="0.84">for a matte display.</text><text start="385.41" dur="2.52">This isn&amp;#39;t like a desktop screen,</text><text start="387.93" dur="1.47">where most people are buying it</text><text start="389.4" dur="3.51">just based on the panel and
the visual display properties.</text><text start="392.91" dur="3.03">There&amp;#39;s a bunch of stuff about
a phone people care about,</text><text start="395.94" dur="3.09">and it turns out people do
not like that trade-off.</text><text start="399.03" dur="2.04">So I&amp;#39;ve talked about all
kinds of other niche features</text><text start="401.07" dur="0.9">in the smartphone world,</text><text start="401.97" dur="1.35">and how they&amp;#39;re awesome</text><text start="403.32" dur="2.82">but won&amp;#39;t actually sell a ton of phones.</text><text start="406.14" dur="2.22">This is, like, the perfect
addition to that pile.</text><text start="408.36" dur="3.39">I mean, TCL has these
special NXTPAPER modes</text><text start="411.75" dur="1.14">in the software,</text><text start="412.89" dur="1.26">and when you turn one of them on,</text><text start="414.15" dur="1.68">one&amp;#39;s called color paper,</text><text start="415.83" dur="1.29">and it goes the extra mile</text><text start="417.12" dur="2.1">to, you know, turn down
saturation a little bit</text><text start="419.22" dur="1.77">and reduce the extra-vibrant colors.</text><text start="420.99" dur="1.23">it adds some texture,</text><text start="422.22" dur="0.93">and everything,</text><text start="423.15" dur="2.52">it literally looks like
your smartphone screen</text><text start="425.67" dur="1.32">is, like, a colored piece of paper,</text><text start="426.99" dur="2.49">with, like, your icons in
colored ink, moving around.</text><text start="429.48" dur="2.55">And then you can go all
the way up to ink paper,</text><text start="432.03" dur="1.29">which goes full black and white.</text><text start="433.32" dur="1.47">It seems silly to most people,</text><text start="434.79" dur="3.36">but when you compare it to
an actual E Ink display,</text><text start="438.15" dur="1.92">that&amp;#39;s when it looks amazing.</text><text start="440.07" dur="1.32">Like, an actual e-reader</text><text start="441.39" dur="2.37">is the least fatiguing
version on your eyes,</text><text start="443.76" dur="1.05">but if you&amp;#39;ve ever used one,</text><text start="444.81" dur="2.37">you know that frame rates are pretty slow,</text><text start="447.18" dur="1.38">Like, you can hardly get</text><text start="448.56" dur="2.37">like, even a real
page-turning book animation</text><text start="450.93" dur="3">on some of the absolute
bleeding-edge best versions we have,</text><text start="453.93" dur="2.13">so a smartphone with a
special hardware layer</text><text start="456.06" dur="1.89">that gets close to the same visual level</text><text start="457.95" dur="3.84">but is 90 hertz, fully
responsive, full color,</text><text start="461.79" dur="1.83">and can do anything your phone can do</text><text start="463.62" dur="1.38">on top of being an e-reader,</text><text start="465" dur="1.5">is technically awesome,</text><text start="466.5" dur="2.34">which is why TCL also makes
a tablet version of this</text><text start="468.84" dur="1.23">and another phone version of this.</text><text start="470.07" dur="3.21">It is super cool, but almost
no one&amp;#39;s gonna buy it,</text><text start="473.28" dur="2.19">and that&amp;#39;s why not every other phone</text><text start="475.47" dur="1.8">is going out to do this too,</text><text start="477.27" dur="1.77">at least for now, anyway.</text><text start="479.04" dur="1.26">Thanks for watching.</text><text start="480.3" dur="1.56">Catch you guys the next one.</text><text start="481.86" dur="0.833">Peace.</text></transcript>
