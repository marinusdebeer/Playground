the new worst product</text><text start="28.62" dur="3.18">I think I&amp;#39;ve ever reviewed,

kind of distracting</text><text start="39.18" dur="2.4">to like understand what
the point of the device is</text><text start="41.58" dur="0.833">as we go through it.</text><text start="42.413" dur="2.377">So I&amp;#39;m gonna have to separate
it out for this video.</text><text start="44.79" dur="2.31">First, I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you what it is,</text><text start="47.1" dur="2.61">and what it&amp;#39;s supposed to do,</text><text start="49.71" dur="3.42">and then I&amp;#39;ll tell you what my experience</text><text start="53.13" dur="2.266">has actually been using it.</text><text start="55.396" dur="3.667">(mellow instrumental music)</text><text start="60.09" dur="3.39">So this thing is a
small, wearable computer,</text><text start="63.48" dur="1.71">with an AI inside,</text><text start="65.19" dur="1.59">that can help you throughout your day.</text><text start="66.78" dur="2.01">It&amp;#39;s about the size of a large watch.</text><text start="68.79" dur="1.89">It has a camera and a microphone,</text><text start="70.68" dur="1.68">and can interact with
the world around you.</text><text start="72.36" dur="1.8">But in case you can&amp;#39;t use that as input,</text><text start="74.16" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s also a touch pad

style of gesture control,</text><text start="81.84" dur="1.92">with the projection on your hand.</text><text start="83.76" dur="4.14">It costs $700, plus...</text><text start="87.9" dur="2.46">A $24 a month subscription plan</text><text start="90.36" dur="1.77">for the data that comes with it,</text><text start="92.13" dur="2.94">and all the services and
all the online storage.</text><text start="95.07" dur="5">But yeah, $700, plus a subscription.</text><text start="100.2" dur="1.02">It&amp;#39;s already a fun start.</text><text start="101.22" dur="1.86">So one of the big things off the top is,</text><text start="103.08" dur="3.24">this does not pair to
your smartphone at all.</text><text start="106.32" dur="2.4">This is its own standalone device,</text><text start="108.72" dur="1.62">with its own internet connection,</text><text start="110.34" dur="2.1">with its own phone number.</text><text start="112.44" dur="2.19">And so this little AI assistant</text><text start="114.63" dur="2.55">just goes everywhere with
you, it&amp;#39;s always connected,</text><text start="117.18" dur="0.833">and that&amp;#39;s...</text><text start="118.013" dur="1.897">You can choose how much
or how little to use it</text><text start="119.91" dur="2.31">alongside your smartphone.</text><text start="122.22" dur="0.87">So you know, on its face,</text><text start="123.09" dur="3.06">maybe that&amp;#39;s kind of
a cool idea, at least.</text><text start="126.15" dur="2.28">Like the idea is you
talk to it like a person,</text><text start="128.43" dur="2.79">it answers questions, it
gives you historical facts,</text><text start="131.22" dur="2.04">or personalized recommendations,</text><text start="133.26" dur="1.29">or helps you out with things,</text><text start="134.55" dur="2.25">like brainstorming or remembering things.</text><text start="136.8" dur="3.12">It can make phone calls,
and send text messages.</text><text start="139.92" dur="0.833">A ton of stuff.</text><text start="140.753" dur="1.147">The unfortunate reality though,</text><text start="141.9" dur="1.95">is this thing is too much of a pain to use</text><text start="143.85" dur="3.24">to actually want to do most of that stuff</text><text start="147.09" dur="1.17">alongside your phone.</text><text start="148.26" dur="2.64">But we&amp;#39;ll get there.</text><text start="150.9" dur="3.667">(mellow instrumental music)</text><text start="156.06" dur="1.8">All right, let me actually
start with the hardware.</text><text start="157.86" dur="2.25">This little thing, the
build of this thing,</text><text start="160.11" dur="1.47">is actually impressive.</text><text start="161.58" dur="2.16">Like genuinely, I think if
you&amp;#39;re looking for a reason</text><text start="163.74" dur="2.61">to feel like you&amp;#39;re
not getting ripped off,</text><text start="166.35" dur="3.33">the hardware packaging actually
kind of accomplishes that.</text><text start="169.68" dur="4.17">Like this pin is solid, it&amp;#39;s
aluminum, it&amp;#39;s dense feeling.</text><text start="173.85" dur="1.05">There&amp;#39;s three colors, actually.</text><text start="174.9" dur="2.1">There&amp;#39;s all matte black,
which is the cheapest one.</text><text start="177" dur="1.59">Or for a hundred bucks more,</text><text start="178.59" dur="2.52">you can get white or
this black and silver one</text><text start="181.11" dur="0.9">that I&amp;#39;m using.</text><text start="182.01" dur="2.04">And then there&amp;#39;s a lot of
sensors packed up there.</text><text start="184.05" dur="2.55">There&amp;#39;s a camera, there&amp;#39;s
microphones, there&amp;#39;s lights,</text><text start="186.6" dur="2.55">there&amp;#39;s a tiny class 2 laser projector.</text><text start="189.15" dur="2.82">So this whole thing is
like really densely packed.</text><text start="191.97" dur="2.94">And then the magnets also
that connect everything,</text><text start="194.91" dur="1.11">are super strong.</text><text start="196.02" dur="4.32">So the back of this pin
is called a &amp;quot;booster&amp;quot;.</text><text start="200.34" dur="1.29">It&amp;#39;s another battery.</text><text start="201.63" dur="1.68">So it&amp;#39;s got its own internal battery,</text><text start="203.31" dur="2.04">but then once you attach
it to your clothes,</text><text start="205.35" dur="2.82">it cleverly, through your
clothes, magnetizes there.</text><text start="208.17" dur="1.95">It makes a nice sound when you do.</text><text start="210.12" dur="1.26">And that&amp;#39;s how you get it attached.</text><text start="211.38" dur="1.38">So you get two of these boosters.</text><text start="212.76" dur="1.47">And since there&amp;#39;s the internal battery,</text><text start="214.23" dur="2.01">you can literally hot swap between them</text><text start="216.24" dur="1.47">so the thing stays alive.</text><text start="217.71" dur="1.02">Very clever.</text><text start="218.73" dur="2.97">And then it also comes with
this extremely well-made,</text><text start="221.7" dur="3.12">and also very, very
reflective charging case.</text><text start="224.82" dur="2.19">So you can pop it in there,
or just your battery in there,</text><text start="227.01" dur="1.23">keep it topped off.</text><text start="228.24" dur="2.34">That charges by USB Type-C.</text><text start="230.58" dur="0.833">This thing is nice.</text><text start="231.413" dur="2.347">And it also comes with this
like desktop charging puck,</text><text start="233.76" dur="2.28">where you can magnetize in the battery,</text><text start="236.04" dur="0.833">or the whole thing.</text><text start="236.873" dur="1.777">The pin and the booster at the same time.</text><text start="238.65" dur="1.59">So that is a lot of charging</text><text start="240.24" dur="1.74">and battery related accessories,</text><text start="241.98" dur="1.53">but they all come with it.</text><text start="243.51" dur="0.96">And this pin, you know,</text><text start="244.47" dur="1.86">it&amp;#39;s also got these
lights up at the top here</text><text start="246.33" dur="1.77">that light up anytime
you&amp;#39;re doing anything.</text><text start="248.1" dur="2.31">And there&amp;#39;s also a small
pin light notification</text><text start="250.41" dur="1.47">for when there&amp;#39;s
something waiting for you.</text><text start="251.88" dur="1.59">So between the weight of the parts</text><text start="253.47" dur="2.4">and the strength of the magnets,
how it all slaps together,</text><text start="255.87" dur="1.47">like you can tell that a lot of effort</text><text start="257.34" dur="3.12">was put into the
craftsmanship of this product,</text><text start="260.46" dur="1.8">which I very much appreciate.</text><text start="262.26" dur="5">It&amp;#39;s the best part of the pin, by a lot.</text><text start="267.389" dur="3.667">(mellow instrumental music)</text><text start="272.41" dur="2.69">Okay, I want you to forget

of stuff, and is very helpful.</text><text start="284.34" dur="2.49">So again, think of this

for several days straight,</text><text start="1184.19" dur="1.17">and tell it to remember everything,</text><text start="1185.36" dur="2.01">and call people, text people from it,</text><text start="1187.37" dur="3.18">but it will always have that gap.</text><text start="1190.55" dur="1.71">And that&amp;#39;s not even
mentioning this, like I said,</text><text start="1192.26" dur="1.59">it has its own phone number,</text><text start="1193.85" dur="3.63">and so if you text people
and call people from this,</text><text start="1197.48" dur="3.06">yeah, it can summarize all of
your messages from the day,</text><text start="1200.54" dur="3.36">and all that stuff from
these conversations,</text><text start="1203.9" dur="3.45">but it doesn&amp;#39;t see any
of these conversations.</text><text start="1207.35" dur="1.74">So if you&amp;#39;re texting here,</text><text start="1209.09" dur="2.7">this is not the same thread.</text><text start="1211.79" dur="1.35">That gap is always gonna be there.</text><text start="1213.14" dur="2.79">So I guess that begs the question,</text><text start="1215.93" dur="5">why didn&amp;#39;t they just make
this connect to your phone?</text><text start="1221.27" dur="1.83">Everyone has a phone.</text><text start="1223.1" dur="1.65">That&amp;#39;s the question that I think</text><text start="1224.75" dur="1.98">a lot of people are wondering.</text><text start="1226.73" dur="1.65">And I think...</text><text start="1228.38" dur="4.62">This is my theory, but I
think Humane wants this thing</text><text start="1233" dur="5">to eventually be a very powerful
standalone device someday.</text><text start="1238.79" dur="2.01">And in order to get it to that future,</text><text start="1240.8" dur="2.4">they can&amp;#39;t set the precedent now</text><text start="1243.2" dur="1.89">of connecting it to your
phone, &amp;#39;cause then that means</text><text start="1245.09" dur="1.65">they have to remove that
feature in the future,</text><text start="1246.74" dur="1.56">and they don&amp;#39;t wanna do that.</text><text start="1248.3" dur="3.6">So this device as it exists today</text><text start="1251.9" dur="4.83">is hamstrung by its ideal
future version of itself.</text><text start="1256.73" dur="0.87">It&amp;#39;s like Vision Pro.</text><text start="1257.6" dur="1.41">Like I talked about it
in the Vision Pro review.</text><text start="1259.01" dur="2.73">It doesn&amp;#39;t actually pair
to your iPhone in any way.</text><text start="1261.74" dur="1.68">It&amp;#39;s its own standalone computer.</text><text start="1263.42" dur="1.92">And of course, Apple sees down the road,</text><text start="1265.34" dur="1.89">that could just be like a
little pair of smart glasses.</text><text start="1267.23" dur="1.77">You don&amp;#39;t need an iPhone to use that.</text><text start="1269" dur="3.57">But now, today, this thing is a victim</text><text start="1272.57" dur="1.718">of its future ambition.</text><text start="1274.288" dur="3.667">(mellow instrumental music)</text><text start="1278.96" dur="3">It was really hard to come up
