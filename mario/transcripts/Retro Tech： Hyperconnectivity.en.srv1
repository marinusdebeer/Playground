MKBHD here.</text><text start="37.536" dur="2.97">And today we&amp;#39;re gonna be

about to unbox today</text><text start="45.544" dur="2.703">comes from 1984.</text><text start="48.28" dur="1.803">I got no idea what this is.</text><text start="50.116" dur="1.001">Let&amp;#39;s find out.</text><text start="53.219" dur="1.468">Okay.</text><text start="54.72" dur="1.836">So, this says &amp;quot;Phone-Mate.&amp;quot;</text><text start="56.589" dur="2.736">&amp;quot;Answering machine with

Oh, yeah.</text><text start="62.228" dur="1.435">I remember
answering machines.</text><text start="63.696" dur="2.069">Every phone
you&amp;#39;ve probably ever owned</text><text start="65.798" dur="1.735">has always had voicemail.</text><text start="67.566" dur="1.636">But when you go back
to the &amp;#39;80s,</text><text start="69.235" dur="2.469">you had to build that
and buy that.</text><text start="71.737" dur="2.803">Pretty revolutionary,
when you put it that way.</text><text start="74.573" dur="1.035">Let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s inside.</text><text start="79.245" dur="1.201">Hey!</text><text start="80.479" dur="2.003">Oh, you saved your voicemail</text><text start="82.515" dur="1.868">on a cassette.</text><text start="84.416" dur="1.369">Wow, that is definitely wood,</text><text start="85.818" dur="2.903">but a lot of things

&amp;#39;90s, even.</text><text start="90.489" dur="1.636">And then you have to
open up in here.</text><text start="92.158" dur="1.468">That&amp;#39;s where your
cassette tapes go, right there.</text><text start="93.659" dur="2.169">I have a messages

somewhere?</text><text start="120.219" dur="1.335">Oh.</text><text start="121.587" dur="2.803">It should&amp;#39;ve been that easy.

we&amp;#39;re here to find out,</text><text start="172.905" dur="1.535">so let&amp;#39;s get into it.</text><text start="177.676" dur="2.27">- Welcome to &amp;quot;Retro Tech.&amp;quot;
- Thank you.</text><text start="179.979" dur="1.935">First thing
I&amp;#39;m gonna ask you to do</text><text start="181.947" dur="0.968">is check underneath your chair.</text><text start="182.948" dur="1.502">Underneath my chair?</text><text start="184.483" dur="2.737">Oh, this is what my dad
was talking about.</text><text start="187.253" dur="3.737">This is the old joint.</text><text start="191.023" dur="1.835">Oh, no, does this
have a tape deck in it?</text><text start="192.891" dur="1.536">Oh, yeah.</text><text start="194.46" dur="4.805">The lovely early &amp;#39;80s faux wood.
This is perfect.</text><text start="199.298" dur="2.67">Marques: All right,
we can put it to the side
and we can talk tech.</text><text start="202.001" dur="1.768">If I zoom all the way out</text><text start="203.802" dur="2.003">to the beginning
of communication tech,</text><text start="205.838" dur="1.402">how did this
whole thing start?</text><text start="207.273" dur="1.568">When you talk
about the evolution</text><text start="208.874" dur="1.669">of instant communication,</text><text start="210.576" dur="2.302">you start with the telephone

- The telephone was
  a game-changer.</text><text start="217.783" dur="2.736">&lt;i&gt; People for the first time
 could actually have
 conversations&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="220.552" dur="1.869">&lt;i&gt; with people who were
 not in the same room as them.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="222.454" dur="1.469">This was unheard of.</text><text start="223.956" dur="1.902">&lt;i&gt; But you had
 to kind of be tethered&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="225.891" dur="1.135">&lt;i&gt; to that wall
 where it was plugged in.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="227.059" dur="1.835">Oh, hello!</text><text start="228.927" dur="2.403">&lt;i&gt; And if you weren&amp;#39;t home,
 you would not get the call.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="231.363" dur="2.169">Not only that, you wouldn&amp;#39;t
know who had called.</text><text start="233.565" dur="2.97">There was no caller ID
when telephones first came out.</text><text start="236.568" dur="4.972">You missed out.
You literally just missed out
on what could have been.</text><text start="241.573" dur="3.805">So, was getting something like
an answering machine a big deal?</text><text start="245.411" dur="3.604">So, you&amp;#39;ve never had
an answering machine
with a landline?</text><text start="249.048" dur="2.703">I came into the game
at the very end.</text><text start="251.784" dur="2.269">Stephanie:&lt;i&gt;
 It was a huge deal.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="254.086" dur="2.67">Adesina:&lt;i&gt;
 The answering machine
 represented freedom,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="256.789" dur="3.637">freedom from being
tethered to your home phone

 As we move forward

advanced were a huge deal.</text><text start="296.528" dur="3.037">&lt;i&gt; We had two-way call waiting,
 where you could be on a call,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="299.598" dur="1.335">&lt;i&gt; you would hear that beep.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="300.966" dur="1.602">&amp;quot;Hold on. I got a call
on my other line.&amp;quot;</text><text start="302.601" dur="2.803">- Hello, Jim?
- They had three-way calling,</text><text start="305.437" dur="2.536">&lt;i&gt; so you could have
 almost a conference call.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="308.006" dur="3.438">They had call forwarding,
so if you weren&amp;#39;t gonna be home,</text><text start="311.477" dur="3.437">&lt;i&gt; you could forward the calls
 to the place where
 you were going to be.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="314.947" dur="2.77">And then aesthetically,
they had everything--</text><text start="317.75" dur="3.136">&lt;i&gt; fun colors,
 ginormous buttons,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="320.919" dur="3.538">&lt;i&gt; the clear phone,
 where you could see the guts
 of the technology.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="324.49" dur="2.436">&lt;i&gt; We had some pretty innovative
 landlines at the time.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="326.959" dur="2.503">But we&amp;#39;re never satisfied
because sci-fi</text><text start="329.495" dur="2.402">has been tantalizing us

 were teasing us&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="340.005" dur="2.036">&lt;i&gt; about the video phones
 of the future.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="342.074" dur="3.737">AT&amp;amp;T in particular
had this commercial campaign
called &amp;quot;You Will,&amp;quot;</text><text start="345.844" dur="2.703">&lt;i&gt; and started marketing
 to regular people&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="348.58" dur="4.071">&lt;i&gt; things like, you will
 tuck your baby in at night
 via video chat.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="352.684" dur="2.804">This is one vision
of the future,</text><text start="355.521" dur="2.469">with video screens
linking via phone lines</text><text start="358.023" dur="1.602">to anywhere in the world.</text><text start="359.658" dur="1.469">&lt;i&gt; We wanted video phones&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="361.16" dur="2.336">&lt;i&gt; because that

 a lot of more effort&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="371.87" dur="2.27">&lt;i&gt; into a more familiar

 by comedian Chuck Nice&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="376.708" dur="1.869">&lt;i&gt; to check out some
 retro landlines&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="378.61" dur="2.236">&lt;i&gt; that seemed futuristic

of a practical use for this</text><text start="510.842" dur="1.869">other than this
is the coolest thing
I&amp;#39;ve seen in a long time.</text><text start="512.744" dur="2.87">Even in 2021,
I kind of still want one.</text><text start="515.647" dur="1.435">- This is dope.
  This is definitely dope.
- This is dope. Yeah.</text><text start="517.115" dur="3.438">That might be
the easiest dope I&amp;#39;ve given.</text><text start="520.586" dur="3.57">All right,
this next item, Chuck,
comes to us from 1999.</text><text start="524.189" dur="3.871">- Hyper VideoPhone.
- A newer version
  of the video phone.</text><text start="528.093" dur="2.77">- Gigantic.
- It&amp;#39;s huge.</text><text start="530.896" dur="2.87">- It looks very office-y.
- I&amp;#39;m a fan of this right here.</text><text start="533.799" dur="2.402">- Adjustable angle.
- Now, that&amp;#39;s cool.</text><text start="536.234" dur="1.602">I don&amp;#39;t know why
it would go that far down.</text><text start="537.869" dur="3.337">I don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re
showing on this video phone.</text><text start="541.239" dur="2.937">- All right.
- So you have yours.</text><text start="544.209" dur="3.404">I&amp;#39;ve got mine.
I&amp;#39;ma just call your number.</text><text start="547.646" dur="2.069">- ( ringing )
- I wonder if you&amp;#39;ll see me.</text><text start="549.748" dur="2.603">I don&amp;#39;t know why
that startled-- look,
I can see you on the--</text><text start="552.384" dur="2.603">- Oh, that&amp;#39;s crazy.
  What&amp;#39;s good?
- Yo, what up, homey?</text><text start="555.02" dur="2.937">- It&amp;#39;s a much better screen,
  I&amp;#39;ll tell you that much.
- It&amp;#39;s color now.</text><text start="557.99" dur="2.336">We are making
technological progress here,</text><text start="560.359" dur="3.67">but it&amp;#39;s not
that much better.</text><text start="564.062" dur="4.272">I think there&amp;#39;s an element
of it being more impressive
with the older tech.</text><text start="568.367" dur="3.403">It&amp;#39;s better, but it&amp;#39;s
not quite the same level
as a game-changer,</text><text start="571.803" dur="1.302">as, like, the first one.</text><text start="573.138" dur="2.57">So, Hyper Video Phone,
not as dope,</text><text start="575.741" dur="0.968">&amp;#39;cause there&amp;#39;s levels to this.</text><text start="576.742" dur="1.401">- Right?
- But it&amp;#39;s dope.</text><text start="578.176" dur="3.004">Chuck:
A little less dope,
but still dope.</text><text start="581.213" dur="3.07">All right,
our next item comes to us
from the year 1998.</text><text start="584.316" dur="3.57">What in the heck?
3D Tel-Mouse?</text><text start="587.919" dur="2.87">it&amp;#39;s a mouse telephone.</text><text start="590.822" dur="1.102">Oh, no.</text><text start="594.192" dur="1.803">The setup disk.</text><text start="596.028" dur="3.036">If only we had
an entire computer.</text><text start="599.097" dur="1.87">Wow!</text><text start="602.401" dur="1.535">Look at that.</text><text start="606.204" dur="2.003">Here you are, 1998.</text><text start="608.24" dur="2.703">You&amp;#39;re working on
a very important document</text><text start="610.976" dur="1.402">and you have to make
a phone call.</text><text start="612.411" dur="2.302">What do you do?
You have to stop your work.</text><text start="614.746" dur="2.67">- I put it my little...
- Time-Life earpiece.</text><text start="617.449" dur="2.603">- And then I--
- You have to dial.</text><text start="620.085" dur="2.67">- ( phone rings )
- Oh!</text><text start="622.788" dur="1.501">Wassup?</text><text start="624.322" dur="1.936">Yo, this is the worst
headset I&amp;#39;ve ever--</text><text start="626.291" dur="2.103">- It&amp;#39;s the worst headset.
- It&amp;#39;s all good.</text><text start="628.427" dur="1.802">I&amp;#39;ma just hang up
real quick from the mouse.</text><text start="630.262" dur="2.536">- ( dial tone )
- Okay.</text><text start="632.831" dur="1.569">- Wow.
- Maybe they&amp;#39;re thinking,</text><text start="634.433" dur="2.836">&amp;quot;What if your phone
is a part of your computer?&amp;quot;</text><text start="637.302" dur="2.87">But that was
a lot to go through
to make a phone call.</text><text start="640.205" dur="4.572">This is ultimately just
a kind of clever workaround idea</text><text start="644.81" dur="2.87">that will inevitably die
when you can do both at once.</text><text start="647.713" dur="1.969">- Right.
- So, the conclusion,
  at the end of the day,</text><text start="649.715" dur="2.235">the 3D Tel-Mouse,
that&amp;#39;s a nope.</text><text start="651.983" dur="1.169">That&amp;#39;s a nope.</text><text start="655.153" dur="1.969">- Chuck, thanks for joining me.
- Always a pleasure, man.</text><text start="657.155" dur="2.703">- Appreciate it.
- And it was so fun
  talking on the phone.</text><text start="659.891" dur="2.236">It&amp;#39;s been a while.</text><text start="662.16" dur="2.203">&lt;i&gt; Nowadays, when we look
 at a laptop or a computer,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="664.396" dur="1.935">&lt;i&gt; we know it&amp;#39;s
 a communication device.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="666.364" dur="1.536">&lt;i&gt; But before the era
 of Internet connectivity,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="667.933" dur="3.303">&lt;i&gt; we had no idea
 where we were headed.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="671.269" dur="2.537">You think about that
&amp;quot;Today&amp;quot; show interview
where Katie Couric</text><text start="673.839" dur="1.468">and Bryant Gumbel were like,
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the Internet?&amp;quot;</text><text start="675.34" dur="2.47">Alison, can you explain
what Internet is?</text><text start="677.843" dur="1.602">What, do you write to it,
like mail?</text><text start="679.478" dur="1.935">A lot of people
just still didn&amp;#39;t get it.</text><text start="681.446" dur="1.736">Adesina:&lt;i&gt;

We loved it.</text><text start="685.851" dur="1.201">We were not mad about it.</text><text start="687.085" dur="2.069">And when the Internet
first came out,</text><text start="689.187" dur="1.636">if you wanted to connect,
you had to unplug</text><text start="690.856" dur="1.301">your phone physically</text><text start="692.19" dur="1.936">and connect
that to your computer.</text><text start="694.159" dur="1.335">Imagine if you still
had to do one or the other.</text><text start="695.527" dur="2.803">People would just not
make a phone call ever.</text><text start="698.363" dur="1.736">Adesina:&lt;i&gt; So, why would
 we want to do something&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="700.132" dur="1.835">&lt;i&gt; that&amp;#39;s gonna disable
 our telephone line&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="702" dur="1.802">&lt;i&gt; in order to do
 this completely other&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="703.835" dur="2.069">type of communication
that we&amp;#39;d never seen before?</text><text start="705.937" dur="2.27">&lt;i&gt; That was the trouble
 that AOL had to overcome.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="708.24" dur="1.502">Voice:&lt;i&gt;
 You&amp;#39;ve got mail.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="709.775" dur="2.536">AOL had to convince Americans</text><text start="712.344" dur="1.568">to go online
for the first time.</text><text start="713.945" dur="1.402">&lt;i&gt; The head of marketing says,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="715.38" dur="1.802">&lt;i&gt; &amp;quot;Print up as many discs

 of people however we can.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="719.017" dur="2.269">- And it worked.
- Announcer:&lt;i&gt; America Online,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="721.319" dur="3.104">&lt;i&gt; the company making cyberspace
 easy to use and understand.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="724.456" dur="3.57">At one point, it was estimated
that 50% of all CDs</text><text start="728.059" dur="3.271">made in the USA
were AOL CD-ROMs.</text><text start="731.363" dur="4.805">AOL was the primary way
that most Americans got online
for the first time.</text><text start="736.201" dur="2.636">- I never used AOL.
- Marques, how is that possible?</text><text start="738.87" dur="2.169">What was the experience of,
like, actually using AOL?</text><text start="741.072" dur="2.47">Brenda:&lt;i&gt;
 With AOL, you had
 your e-mail, your news.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="743.575" dur="1.602">&lt;i&gt; It was like a one-stop shop
 for everything.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="745.21" dur="3.337">Later on is when
they came out with AIM.</text><text start="748.58" dur="2.436">When AIM chat came out,
it was the first time</text><text start="751.049" dur="3.003">&lt;i&gt; that we could have instant
 communication via text.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="754.085" dur="2.737">You put your buddy list,
you&amp;#39;d add all your friends,</text><text start="756.855" dur="1.368">and when someone
would get online,</text><text start="758.256" dur="1.202">&lt;i&gt; you would see that
 they were online,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="759.491" dur="2.303">and you could message them.</text><text start="761.827" dur="1.368">Brenda:&lt;i&gt;
 Then you got that little
 satisfying ding.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="763.228" dur="1.669">When I had a crush,
you&amp;#39;d immediately</text><text start="764.93" dur="2.135">jump up and check to see
if it was that person.</text><text start="767.098" dur="2.737">Brian:&lt;i&gt; For anyone
 under the age of 30,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="769.868" dur="1.669">&lt;i&gt; the primary way to keep
 in touch with your friends&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="771.57" dur="2.502">was to go on AIM.</text><text start="774.105" dur="2.437">Brenda:&lt;i&gt;
 It was much different
 platform than phone calls,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="776.575" dur="1.668">and that still allowed you</text><text start="778.276" dur="2.27">to instantly get in touch
with somebody.</text><text start="780.579" dur="1.735">Marques:&lt;i&gt; So, what was
 the experience actually like&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="782.347" dur="1.769">&lt;i&gt; for early AIM chat users?&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="784.149" dur="2.269">&lt;i&gt; Since I&amp;#39;ve never used it,
 I&amp;#39;ve invited fellow&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="786.451" dur="2.536">&lt;i&gt; YouTube creator Sara Dietschy

multiple chats going on.
It was just a blast.</text><text start="811.076" dur="2.402">Well, you&amp;#39;ve probably
already noticed, these two
computers here behind me,</text><text start="813.511" dur="1.803">- they have AIM on them.
- Wow.</text><text start="815.347" dur="2.035">We might as well just jump
right in to that experience.</text><text start="817.415" dur="2.003">I&amp;#39;m so excited right now.</text><text start="819.451" dur="2.736">( modem connecting )</text><text start="822.22" dur="3.17">Well, there&amp;#39;s the logging on

Probably a logical first step
is add a buddy, right?</text><text start="853.251" dur="2.203">Yeah. Add me.</text><text start="855.487" dur="2.169">Family, coworkers,

- A creaking door?</text><text start="867.365" dur="1.936">So, I&amp;#39;m gonna double click

 and it&amp;#39;s reading my brain&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1029.828" dur="3.37">through my skull
and my skin and my hair.</text><text start="1033.231" dur="4.271">&lt;i&gt; So, it&amp;#39;s on the outside
 looking into my brain.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1037.535" dur="4.138">I had an experience
with the NextMind,
had my mind blown.</text><text start="1041.706" dur="3.971">So, exactly what part of
the brain is this device reading
and how does it work?</text><text start="1045.71" dur="2.069">Your brain generates
some electricity.</text><text start="1047.812" dur="2.87">&lt;i&gt; That&amp;#39;s how neurons
 communicate with each other.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1050.715" dur="1.802">&lt;i&gt; And if we put a device here,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1052.55" dur="1.736">&lt;i&gt; we can record
 the neural activity,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1054.319" dur="2.035">&lt;i&gt; we translate
 the neural activity,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1056.387" dur="3.371">and then you can see
that translation directly
on the computer.</text><text start="1059.791" dur="1.468">And it&amp;#39;s on
the back of your head.</text><text start="1061.292" dur="2.069">Is that because
there&amp;#39;s a lot of activity</text><text start="1063.394" dur="2.837">that&amp;#39;s very useful coming
from the back of the brain?</text><text start="1066.264" dur="3.437">It&amp;#39;s measuring activity
of neurons on the visual cortex,</text><text start="1069.734" dur="1.802">&lt;i&gt; which is on the very
 back of the head.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1071.569" dur="1.636">&lt;i&gt; When you see things,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1073.238" dur="1.468">&lt;i&gt; this is happening
 in the visual cortex.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1074.739" dur="1.569">&lt;i&gt; Just by recording
 the activity,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1076.341" dur="2.202">&lt;i&gt; we can create a symbiosis&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1078.576" dur="2.97">between the visual environment
and your brain.</text><text start="1081.579" dur="3.004">Does this feel like
the next logical step</text><text start="1084.616" dur="3.704">of literally just
sending a thought from
one person to another?</text><text start="1088.353" dur="2.202">In just a few decades,
we&amp;#39;re gonna just, like,</text><text start="1090.588" dur="1.636">communicate telepathically
with each other.</text><text start="1092.257" dur="1.301">Oh, wow.</text><text start="1093.591" dur="2.603">Remember, your brain
is a computing machine,</text><text start="1096.227" dur="3.237">&lt;i&gt; so the visual cortex
 is really the strongest
 part of the brain.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1099.497" dur="3.237">So if there&amp;#39;s access
to your visual cortex</text><text start="1102.767" dur="2.937">to transmit it directly
rather than using speech,</text><text start="1105.737" dur="1.668">it&amp;#39;s totally feasible.</text><text start="1107.438" dur="2.303">&lt;i&gt; But what if you could
 communicate&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1109.774" dur="2.536">&lt;i&gt; much, much richer thought?&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1112.343" dur="3.237">&lt;i&gt; Basically, if you can
 capture the intentions
 directly in the brain,&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1115.613" dur="2.803">&lt;i&gt; you just have to imagine it,
 and what&amp;#39;s really happening&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1118.449" dur="3.304">&lt;i&gt; within your mind is projected
 by a telepathic link.&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="1121.786" dur="1.969">The only challenge
is a technical challenge</text><text start="1123.788" dur="2.636">of having the right sensors
to analyze,</text><text start="1126.457" dur="2.704">translate the data
at the speed of thought.</text><text start="1129.194" dur="3.403">So, in a way, it&amp;#39;s like
a more rich version of language.</text><text start="1132.63" dur="1.769">That&amp;#39;s a crazy future.</text><text start="1134.432" dur="1.202">This is definitely
going to happen,</text><text start="1135.667" dur="1.835">and it&amp;#39;s just
a question of time</text><text start="1137.535" dur="1.268">and improving the technology.</text><text start="1138.836" dur="2.07">That is really exciting.</text><text start="1140.939" dur="1.835">I&amp;#39;m looking forward to what
you guys are working on.</text><text start="1142.807" dur="1.902">Thank you so much
for the time.</text><text start="1144.742" dur="1.869">I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot,
and I&amp;#39;m gonna get
back to training.</text><text start="1146.644" dur="1.969">All right, so in the world
we&amp;#39;re living in now,</text><text start="1148.646" dur="5.64">it seems like
we&amp;#39;ve come so far from
phone calls to A.I.M.,</text><text start="1154.319" dur="2.135">all the way to, like,
instantly being able
to talk face to face</text><text start="1156.487" dur="3.404">with anyone in the world
in a high-resolution
multi-person video call.</text><text start="1159.924" dur="4.005">But the future
of not even having
to lift a finger</text><text start="1163.962" dur="2.336">or say a word and you just</text><text start="1166.331" dur="2.469">transmit your thoughts
to another person,</text><text start="1168.833" dur="2.47">or communicate
with a smart device,</text><text start="1171.336" dur="2.302">like, that&amp;#39;s pretty wild.</text><text start="1173.671" dur="2.136">That&amp;#39;s definitely something
to pay attention to.</text><text start="1175.84" dur="2.47">Either way, that&amp;#39;s been it.
Thanks for watching this one.</text><text start="1178.343" dur="2.002">Catch you guys later. Peace.</text></transcript>
