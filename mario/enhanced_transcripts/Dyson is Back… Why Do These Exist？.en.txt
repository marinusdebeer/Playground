So, do you remember about a year ago when Dyson launched those peculiar Dyson Headphones Combo Wearable Air Purifier gadgets? I tested them, reviewed them, and despite giving them a fair chance, they ended up being the single dumbest product I’ve ever reviewed. And they still are. 

Imagine my surprise when Dyson unveiled a new product a year later, and it’s just headphones. They’ve removed the absurd air purifier part and left behind the large metal pair of Dyson headphones that somewhat got overshadowed last time. These are the headphones, and they retail for $500.

So, of course, I’m going to give them a try. There may be someone out there who was put off by the air filter feature but is still intrigued by the concept of high-end Dyson active noise-canceling headphones. I’m dedicated to providing a fair review.

It might not make much sense initially, but consider that AirPods Max also exist. The more you compare them, the clearer it becomes that Dyson seems to have aimed to outdo Apple’s headphones in every conceivable way, while still fitting into the same category of heavy noise-canceling headphones. 

As I mentioned, these headphones retail for $500, which is $50 cheaper than Apple’s. They have replaceable ear cups at $50 a pair—believe it or not, that also undercuts Apple. The rated battery life is an impressive 55 hours, dramatically better than AirPods Max's 20 hours. Plus, Dyson headphones work seamlessly on both iPhone and Android, and they actually feature a real off button.

Now, starting with the weight—these headphones are somehow heavier than Apple’s. They are the heaviest headphones I’ve ever tested at 451 grams, which doesn’t sound great on paper. However, they do distribute that weight well across your head. Everything in these headphones is metal, not just the ear cups, but also the hinges and the top band, except for the super soft top cushion. The left and right ear cushions aren’t as soft because they house the batteries. This weight distribution is why they can be just as comfortable as AirPods Max. They feel different, but the comfort level is acceptable for casual listening.

There’s genuinely a lot of interesting and sometimes clever design in these headphones. The standout feature is the interchangeable back plates and ear cushions. Don’t worry; I’ll get to the sound quality. These ear cups can be replaced with a simple quarter twist, and the back material is a cap that’s also just a quarter twist away from being replaced. This allows you to mix and match colors, but you don't get a bunch of them with the headphones. As previously mentioned, they’re $50 each.

When you visit their website, you choose between four base color combinations. Choose wisely because extra options come at a price. You might have seen what people did a few years ago by mixing and matching ear cup colors with AirPods Max. Dyson seems to have taken that idea to the next level, integrating it as a feature and offering add-ons. It’s fine; it works. Is it a bit gimmicky? Maybe, but you can tell that the lock-and-twist mechanisms are well-designed, ensuring they stay in place yet can be easily swapped out for new caps, which have various finishes. 

Another clever design feature comes from the previous Dyson headphones—a joystick on the back right side. This joystick serves as most of the physical controls, and it’s excellent. You can press it to play or pause, use it to adjust volume, and move left or right to navigate tracks. It sticks out, making it easy to find without looking.

The only other physical control is double-tapping the left ear cup to toggle noise cancellation or transparency mode. Unfortunately, this feature is finicky and only works about 50% of the time. This is not a touch surface; it’s just a cap on the headphones, so you have to apply decent pressure to activate it, which isn’t great.

Additionally, the chime that plays when you first put them on is surprisingly loud. I don’t know why it has to be that way, but it could definitely use a volume adjustment. The headphones only twist in one direction to fold flat, but they don’t actually fold completely. You’ll need a case to transport them. While you don’t necessarily need this case—it’s essentially two flat pieces of silicon connected by elastic—you do have to compress the headphones slightly to fit. There’s also one small pocket at the top for any cables you want to carry.

These headphones come with on-head detection, allowing them to automatically play when you put them on and pause when you take them off. This is pretty standard for high-end headphones. They also offer multi-point connectivity, letting you pair with both your iPhone and Pixel simultaneously. The Dyson app is decent; it lets you change modes and see a graph of the last 30 seconds of sound levels outside versus inside the headphones while using noise cancellation. It may not be the most useful function, but it’s interesting to look at occasionally.

Now, let’s talk about how they sound. They are, after all, headphones, and that’s what people want to know. As your resident non-audiophile, I can say they sound solid but not amazing. While I compared them back-to-back with AirPods Max, which seems like the appropriate comparison, the AirPods sound better in virtually every genre, by about 10 to 25%. You can adjust the EQ in the Dyson app, but there are only three presets: Neutral, Enhanced, and Bass Boost.

The neutral setting is surprisingly flat and honest. The Enhanced setting sounds closest to AirPods Max and works well for music, offering a nice range with deep bass and crisp mids and highs. On the other hand, the Bass Boost setting sounds terrible, but if you're into that, it delivers. The main issue is creating a wide sound stage; the ear cups are quite shallow, often touching my ears, which limits instrument separation.

Overall, they perform like solid B+ noise-canceling headphones at a $300 price point. They feature eight microphones for active noise cancellation, which is decent for reducing white noise, but they don’t outperform competitors like Sony, Bose, or AirPods, which all excel at canceling background noise. The transparency mode is acceptable but not exceptional.

If there’s one standout feature, it’s definitely the battery life. The clever placement of the battery on the headband, rather than resting on your ears, makes a notable difference. I’ve only had to charge them once after a week and a half of heavy usage—over 50 hours with noise cancellation on, which is impressive. Plus, they have an actual off button, which isn’t a standard feature for all headphones.

However, at the end of the day, these are still Dyson headphones. The burning question is, why do they exist? The obvious Business 101 answer is that Dyson invested considerable R&D funds in the earlier air purifier headphones and decided to pivot to something with a larger market: regular headphones. 

So, if you compare these directly to AirPods Max, they don’t seem as ridiculous. They’re built well, offer clever customization features, decent sound, solid physical controls, and superior battery life. But if you stack them against other high-end noise-canceling headphones in the $350 range from other brands, they do seem overpriced.

So, that’s my verdict. Now you know. At least Dyson can say they produced something worthwhile. Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you in the next one. Peace.
