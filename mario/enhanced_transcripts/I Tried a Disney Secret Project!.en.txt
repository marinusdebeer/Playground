- [Marques] Okay, I got to see something really cool. I visited some of the secret labs inside the Walt Disney Company called the Disney Imagineering Labs. I’ve seen a few people talk about them before, but obviously Disney has all these attractions, theme parks, and rides, and someone has to design and engineer all that. There’s a surprising amount of tech involved, and some of it is still experimental and unreleased, with no one outside of Disney—well, except for me—having had the chance to use them.

This place is incredible. Disney Imagineering has several buildings scattered around a California neighborhood that I got to visit, where they create realistic animatronic robots for their attractions. They literally greeted me at the door with these little droids, the same ones roaming around the theme parks. These droids share striking similarities with the Boston Dynamics Spot robot I got to play with a few years ago. The Spot robot can navigate any terrain with an adaptive gait and follows instructions from a custom, surprisingly easy-to-learn controller, allowing it to perform tasks that humans can’t. It’s also super fun to play with.

These little droids for the theme parks work similarly. They adapt to any terrain, walk around, and follow instructions from a customized Steam Deck as a controller, which I learned to use in under a minute. They can interact with guests at the theme park and are enjoyable to play with. It’s really impressive how much tech is packed into these devices. They blend animations from walking to standing and looking around, which is pretty amazing.

But that’s not even why I was there. I was specifically there to be the first person outside of Disney to walk on the HoloTile. You might have seen some videos about this before. The HoloTile is this insane, one-of-a-kind, 360-degree treadmill, essentially a moving floor. It’s still in the experimental phase, and there’s only one in existence, but it’s already got my mind racing with potential applications, especially in VR. There’s actually one specific concern I have, but I’ll get to that in a moment.

Now, I don’t think anyone has fully explained how this thing works yet, but they’ve essentially built a huge number of tiny, one-inch discs that spin on top of their bases, functioning like miniature treadmills that adjust direction according to how you are walking. A normal treadmill only moves in one direction on a flat plane, helping you know exactly where you’re going. But if you want to create a treadmill that can respond and move in any direction, a traditional flat treadmill wouldn’t work well; it would need to spin quickly to match your walking direction, which is a bit crazy.

Instead, they incorporated a bunch of articulating cones with discs on top of them, with motors inside to spin those discs. Here’s the key: the discs are tilted, so only the edge of the disc in the air touches the floor. It’s less of a flat treadmill and more like a series of small blades rotating beneath your feet. When you walk forward, they spin clockwise to move your foot back to the middle, and when you walk backward, they spin counterclockwise to do the same.

I’ve seen videos that Disney has released of a person walking on it, but I had to start small. I’ve never walked on it before, and it can do a lot of things. So, let's take it step by step.

There are three ways to control the HoloTile: by walking on it, using a controller like a PlayStation 5 controller, and just straight-up using your hands to point at it. Let’s start with hands. First, we placed an apple box on the HoloTile. There’s a screen overhead that shows real-time inputs and what the sensors are detecting, both on the floor and around it. They’ve mapped anything crossing a certain line in front of me to move whatever object is on the floor. So when I move my hand in front of that line, the program adjusts the floor to match my hand's movement.

This is pretty amazing! I assume everyone watching has seen Star Wars and can appreciate how cool it would be to have something like this in a Star Wars-themed attraction at a park.

Then, the first time I actually stepped onto the HoloTile was while sitting in a chair, using a PlayStation controller. So I was in a chair placed on a flat wooden base, and they handed me the controller. Here’s how that went.

- [Marques] The left joystick controlled my position, and the right joystick controlled rotation. You could move around freely and adapt quickly. And yes, I was able to steer myself off the floor entirely; I was just cautious about not flinging myself off the edge. It moves fast!

Now that I've experienced the controls, it was time to walk on the HoloTile.

- [Marques] I’m going to start with training mode, which operates at a fraction of normal speed, allowing me to get accustomed to how it works. I’m ready.

- [Speaker] 3, 2, 1, enable.

- [Marques] Training mode is on. I slowly began to walk. I could feel the tiles moving slightly but not too quickly yet. As I walked a little faster and took longer strides, I grew used to the tiles' responsiveness.

The design intended this to be a two-minute process where these tiny tiles gradually sped up their responsiveness to my movements, eventually reaching nearly real-time speed. There’s definitely a learning curve, but I felt comfortable enough to walk without overthinking it.

As I walked, I noticed a few things. First, it was pretty loud, which Disney will need to address if this is ever part of a theme park or even someone’s home. Also, I found it fascinating that I was never really walking in a perfectly straight line. It might feel straight if my foot aligned with a row of discs, but other times, I glided over the tops of ridges without moving directly forward. I can imagine a future version of this will feature many smaller, more numerous discs that are just as powerful—though that’s clearly an engineering challenge.

I spent time with the inventor of the HoloTile, Lanny Smoot, who’s been at Disney for over 20 years and holds more than 70 patents, including the mechanism for how BB-8 rolls around the park and the technology behind real-life lightsabers. He’s quite the legend! 

Lanny demonstrated that two people can use the HoloTile simultaneously while playing a multiplayer racing game, controlling a BB-8 around a course by jogging. It worked well, even though it felt a bit small. It would be even better with more of these floor tiles.

What I found most fascinating was using the HoloTile with a VR headset on. This is what you’d expect for VR, right? I’ve seen other 360-degree treadmill setups before, and while they function, they often struggle to eliminate the disconnect between what your eyes perceive and what your body feels. 

For instance, if you look at your phone in a moving car, your eyes see a stationary screen, but your brain feels you moving forward. This disconnect can lead to motion sickness. The same applies to the moving treadmill in VR. You put on a headset and start walking, seeing yourself advance through a moving environment, but because you’re walking in place, your brain doesn’t recognize that you should be moving forward.

So with the HoloTile, I put on an Apple Vision Pro and walked through a 3D constructed environment. I felt like I was in a holo deck from Star Trek, but I had a harness on because this experience was challenging. My eyes showed movement, but my feet slid around as my brain struggled with the idea that I wasn’t actually moving forward. It was confusing, making it hard to just trust my instincts and walk.

Meanwhile, I watched Lanny with the headset on, effortlessly walking through space and exploring a virtual world, likely a virtual Disney theme park. It felt like the future—freely exploring a vast space, potentially in the comfort of your home. If this technology continues to develop, it may bring us closer to that possibility one day.

Either way, this is definitely incredible tech. I’m grateful to have seen this initial version, and I’m eager to see what future versions will entail. Disney, please invite me back! I want to see what the future of this technology looks like.

Okay, that’s it. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.
