- New intro.  
And there’s new tech coming. I mean, there’s always new tech, but what better time to lay it all out than the beginning of the year for some of the best stuff we’re expecting in 2024?  

Now, there was plenty of great tech in 2023: from smartphones to cameras, VR gadgets, computers, headphones, a bunch of good EVs, and even better EV promises. But 2024 is looking promising. So here are the most interesting new tech items I believe we can look forward to this upcoming year.  

Actually, right at the start of every year is CES in January, out in Las Vegas. This year, again, I will not be there in person, but I will have my eyes on it, hoping to see if anything interesting bubbles up above the rest of the noise. I can always count on you guys to send me that stuff on Twitter if you see anything.  

Typically kicking off the year with a bang is a January Samsung event, so we’re expecting S24 reveal information pretty soon. Based on the leaks, it looks like the S24 family will look very similar to the S23. I’m curious to see what changes they actually make.  

But the big headliner that seems to be right around the corner is the Apple Vision Pro. This feels like maybe the most unprecedented Apple launch in a long time, certainly in my career online. Love them or hate them, Apple is one of the biggest tech companies in the world, and their decision to launch something so unusual is pretty fascinating.  

They’ve shown it on stage, released that announcement video, and announced it months ahead of time, but they haven't shown a single Apple employee or executive wearing it even once. Although they’ve let people test this thing out, including myself on several occasions, nobody has been allowed to film themselves using it. There are still many unanswered questions about how it’s going to work, what it's really good at, and what you'll want to use it for. Will you have to visit an Apple store for a custom fit to buy one of these devices? It’s shaping up to be one of the most interesting new products in a long time.  

We all know it’s super expensive — $3,500. It’s definitely not for everyone. Most people I know don’t even plan on getting one, but it will appeal to early adopters curious about VR. Those who do try it will likely be impressed by the incredible pass-through capability, the immersion, and the high resolution. The eye-tracking feels borderline magical.  

However, it seems challenging to review, as it doesn't really compete with other VR headsets since it’s so much more expensive. This raises a weird question: how can it have no competition? It’s just fascinating. If you want to revisit my initial impressions after trying the Apple Vision Pro on the day it was announced, I’ll link that video below.  

I believe this headset is technically impressive for those who try it. But the other half of the story remains unwritten. What apps will come out for it? What features and use cases will show that the Apple Vision Pro excels? I imagine wearing it on an airplane to watch a movie during a four-hour flight, but it’s heavy, so I’m unsure if I’d want to wear it that long. Plus, will the battery actually last that long? There are many questions and not a lot of answers yet, so I’m looking forward to that this year.  

But you know what I have almost no doubt about? I’m calling it now: remember the word “multimodal.” This is going to be the year of multimodal AI in 2024. We’ve seen so much focus on AI in the past couple of years, mainly revolving around chatbots that take text input and provide text output.  

Now, we’re starting to see what’s called multimodal AI, which means it can process multiple types of input — text, audio, images, or video — and provide a cohesive output. Recently, Google got into trouble for a video that showed their new multimodal Gemini Ultra AI model responding to a series of questions about objects placed on a table. The video was heavily edited, but the idea of that kind of interaction is exciting to me.  

I look forward to a multimodal Google Assistant, whenever that happens. I also did a short video about Meta’s AI smart glasses, which have a camera and a multimodal AI model that assists the user by looking at things. Multimodal AI is definitely a concept to remember moving forward.  

This doesn’t even account for all the non-consumer-facing aspects of AI, such as finding patterns in vast data sets, predicting and controlling wildfires, inventing new materials, or curing diseases. What a world we live in!  

- We truly live in an age of wonders.    

New hardware is always exciting, right? New phones, tablets, computers — all that stuff. Here’s something interesting: not a single new iPad was released in 2023. Makes you think.  

Apple tends to make amazing hardware changes to the iPad Pro occasionally. I think the iPad Pro is genuinely one of the most impressive pieces of tech I’ve ever used. They do that every year or two, but in the end, it’s still just an iPad.  

I say this with hesitation, but I am actually really looking forward to seeing the rumored new OLED iPad Pro in 2024. That’s something we’ve been hearing about for a while. Currently, we have the OLED S8 Ultra — that tablet looks amazing. I want to see a super bright OLED display on an iPad. We’ll see if that shows up soon.  

Another interesting design change we’re expecting from Apple is the Watch 10, the 10th generation Apple Watch. All signs point toward a truly redesigned Apple Watch for the first time in a long time. Let’s be real: the Apple Watch has looked about the same for ages. Yes, the Ultra is a little bigger and flatter, but Series 9 looks just like Series 8, which looks just like Series 7, Series 6, and Series 5. They’re all the same shape, with just minor bezel reductions.  

Change for the sake of change isn’t particularly useful, but I think the Apple Watch could actually use a refresh to catch up with Galaxy Watches. Nice circles might be a refreshing look. Also, have you heard that the Apple Watch is dangerously close to being banned in the U.S.? That could be worth a separate video. Stay tuned for more on that.  

Oh, and RCS on the iPhone! I’m excited for RCS to finally come to the iPhone sometime in 2024. They haven’t specified when, but Apple’s committed to it. I usually don’t root for tech to fail, but it’s time to be done with SMS forever. Welcome aboard!  

Now, here’s a more general thought: I hope we see some genuinely interesting smartphones this year. I realize that's a slightly crazy ask since smartphones are kind of mature, looking similar year after year, and even folding ones are beginning to look alike. But I think this is a ripe time for a new mid-range smartphone that tries something truly innovative. It might not happen, but I’m hoping for it in 2024.  

Also, I’ve mentioned before that every year for the next 15 years is destined to be interesting for electric cars, and I don’t think 2024 will be any exception. We already have solid EVs available, with the most popular new car being an EV. Plus, the NACS port has garnered numerous commitments from nearly all electric car manufacturers, meaning Tesla Superchargers will be available to many more vehicles.  

In the upcoming year, we already have Tesla Cybertrucks hitting the streets — that’s pretty crazy. We also expect a Model 3 and Model Y refresh very soon. The Model 3 refresh is already shipping in Europe and Asia, and it should be in the U.S. shortly. Stay tuned to the Auto Focus channel for an in-depth look at those.  

We recently saw a fresh Porsche Taycan drop a crazy Nürburgring lap time, making it a competitor to the Model S Plaid at the high end. We should also see more affordable EVs over the next few years. Plus, we’ll have hybrids for those not ready to go fully electric. This should result in one of the most interesting years yet for automotive tech, and I’m excited for that.  

Of course, I’m also hoping to see significant strides in other tech areas this year. I wanted to wrap up by mentioning some of the videos I’m most looking forward to. Last year, there were over 70 new videos on this channel, all super fun. I have a threshold for what I consider a certified hit — when people mention these videos to me in real life. A few really stood out: the Tesla Solar Roof video, the Tesla Cybertruck video, Apple Vision Pro, and the Formula 1 explain video.  

I especially enjoyed the Formula 1 explain video because that sport is incredibly high-tech, but I also think there's a lot of other tech in various sports worth highlighting. This could be in the sport itself, in training, or in broadcasting. Think of those highlight moments in a tennis match where the slow-mo camera captures the ball just on the line and the instant replay. There are also elements in football and baseball, like the line of scrimmage or the pitch count.  

My point is that I’m probably making sports tech videos in 2024 since I had such a good time with those and am keenly interested. I also want to focus more on collaborations in general. I’ve enjoyed the "Waveform" podcast, so if you haven’t subscribed there, check the link below. We host guests regularly, and those conversations are valuable.  

I’d love collaborations with others on YouTube too, so if you have suggestions for channels you’d like to see us collaborate with, please leave a comment below. Additionally, there are a few top-secret projects we’ve been working on that will finally launch in 2024. You’ll know them when you see them — big announcements are coming. Stay tuned here, on Twitter, and everywhere else for that. I’ve included subtle Easter eggs for the two biggest projects in this video. Once they are announced, you’ll catch on.  

So, look forward to all that this year! I’m wrapping it up here. Thanks for watching, and see you in 2024 — starting now. Peace!
