All right, so the CMF Phone 1 by Nothing has a confusing name, but what this phone aims to do is not confusing at all. Love it or hate it, this is one of the most interesting new phones in the world right now. Nothing came along a few years ago and said, "Hey, what if we tried to make an average budget phone but with a focus on software and design?" And it kind of worked; those phones are pretty good. Now, CMF is the budget sub-brand of Nothing, and they've come along and asked, "What if we did the same thing, but even more?" That's how you end up with this.

This is a $200 Android phone that, on paper, doesn't really stand out in terms of specs among the sea of other $200 Android phones available, but it certainly stands out with its software and design. I want to start with the design first because that’s the most interesting aspect of this phone by a mile. The CMF Phone 1 is in black, and at first glance, it’s nothing too crazy. It has flat sides, fairly average bezels surrounding a large AMOLED display, and dual cameras located in the corner on the back.

However, there are two notable features: first, there's a knob, or dial, in the bottom corner of the phone, and second, there are multiple metal screws around the edges. This is because the plastic back is completely removable and replaceable in a few different colors—there's black, orange, blue, and a light blue that can appear greenish, depending on one’s perspective. Right off the bat, this idea is quite unique for any phone, especially at this price. I remember back during the Moto Maker days when you could somewhat customize your phone, but that was much more permanent. It's been many years since we've had removable backs on phones.

While the battery isn’t removable, and the back does feel cheap and flexible, once it’s attached to the phone, it feels pretty rigid and sturdy. It's neat to see the ability to change colors, and it offers a convenient upsell for the company selling the phone at such a low price. In the box with the cover, you also get a little orange combo SIM ejector tool and flat-head screwdriver since you'll need this tool to remove the SIM card tray and all the screws to detach the back. It comes with a matching SIM card tray and dial for a cohesive look, but you can mix and match if you want, which might make the phone feel a little more personal.

Now, regarding the knob I keep mentioning—initially, there was some speculation about its function. Is it a volume knob, a fidget toy, or a mappable feature? It turns out it's a mounting point for some accessories. It doesn’t spin freely; rather, it’s like a fancy thumbscrew with a colorful cap. You can replace it with one of three accessories they've made so far: a kickstand that props up your phone on a flat surface, a card holder wallet that lets you carry up to four cards with magnets on the back, or a lanyard option for those who prefer to have their phone hanging around their neck.

Is this a gimmick? I’d say no. The kickstand is genuinely something I'd want on my phone or to have the option available. This just adds another useful aspect to separate it from other $200 phones design-wise. It resembles an ultra-budget version of MagSafe, as instead of magnets you screw the accessory onto your phone. Interestingly, the magnetic accessory plate you screw under the back of your phone connects with the magnets in the middle.

Just for fun, I tried a MagSafe mount, and it held the phone surprisingly well. You could potentially use MagSafe accessories with this phone. It does take some effort—several screws, the SIM card ejector tool, and twisting—to switch these accessories, so this isn't something you'd likely do every day, but the option is there. When nothing is attached to the back, the dial protrudes the same amount as the camera bump across from it, preventing any wobbling. Well played, CMF.

While they have many neat hardware customizations, another important aspect of a phone is how it performs in daily use. I've used the CMF Phone 1 for about a week, and honestly, it feels just like I'm using a Nothing phone, which is praise. It's running Nothing OS 2.6, and aside from the light-up glyph interface, it doesn't miss any features that the more premium Nothing phones have. It includes features like cloned apps for multiple instances of one app, Game Mode, and clever one-handed pull-down gestures for notifications, plus all the aesthetics like the icon pack, home screen widgets, and font. It even has a spot to view all your notification history, which is an underrated feature.

Using this phone, I found there were times I'd forget I was using a budget device. It has a bright, responsive AMOLED display that typically ranges from 500 to 700 nits but can peak at 2,000 nits, and it has an adaptive refresh rate between 60 and 120Hz with a 240Hz touch sample rate, making it smooth and quick. For everyday tasks like scrolling through social media or reading emails, this phone performs exceptionally well.

Powering everything is the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 5G, which benchmarks similarly to the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1. This is paired with either six or eight gigs of RAM, making it well-equipped for a $200 phone. However, this phone can certainly show its price point—it’s not perfect. These aren’t complaints, but rather facts about the trade-offs that naturally accompany such an affordable device. 

For instance, the phone features a 5000mAh battery with solid battery life, but there’s no wireless charging, and it doesn’t come with a charger in the box. While it supports charging up to 33 watts, it lacks NFC, has a subpar vibration motor, and a single mono speaker at the bottom that’s easy to block. The optical under-screen fingerprint sensor is impressive for this price range, but it’s often slow and sometimes requires multiple attempts to unlock.

The removable plastic backs feel sturdy when attached, but they show their flimsy side when detached. The buttons feel like they’re barely held on, which raises concerns about their durability. Since the back is removable, the phone can’t be very water-resistant, only rated IP52—good for splashes, not much more.

As for the camera, the CMF Phone 1 has a 50-megapixel Sony IMX882 primary sensor that produces serviceable photos. It’s not terrible, but it lacks optical image stabilization, making low light photography challenging. The second sensor, however, is merely a depth sensor for capturing 2x portrait photos; it doesn’t significantly impact other photography tasks.

Budget phones often come with sacrifices, and this one is no exception. However, I appreciate the trade-offs made in favor of good design and software. Looking back at it, it’s not a bad phone for $200. This device is primarily targeted at India, where it competes in a market with other budget options that tend to offer two years of software updates, three years of security updates, and large screens, all while typically lacking AMOLED displays.

Despite the competition, my experience was enjoyable; I often forget the phone’s price due to its smooth performance and feature set, which is commendable. It feels like a $200 phone designed to look cool. CMF has also unveiled other products, like a new smartwatch priced at $69 and a new set of earbuds for $59.

Let me know your thoughts! That’s my review of the CMF Phone 1. Thanks for watching, and catch you guys in the next one. Peace.
