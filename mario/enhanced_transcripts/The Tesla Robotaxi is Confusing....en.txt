Okay, so the Tesla Robotaxi unveiling event was a couple of days ago, and it might be the strangest tech event I've ever attended. You may have seen some clips from it by now. I was there, I rode in the self-driving Robotaxi, explored the striking Robovan, and even interacted with the Optimus robot. By the time I left, I felt somewhat confused—it was definitely a peculiar event. Here are the three main reasons why.

First of all, the Robo cab was the main attraction we were anticipating: the full unveiling of a completely self-driving Tesla. When we saw it, it resembled a mini Cybertruck, complete with a light bar on the front and back, and an obvious lack of rear visibility. It's a two-door, two-seater passenger car. People had been curious what a full self-driving Robo cab would look like compared to a traditional vehicle like a Model 3 or a Waymo. There were notable differences; the exterior had a distinct light gold color, and every vehicle was painted in this silvery-gold hue, though no mention was made of the materials used. 

The design had a compact footprint and, significantly, no exterior door handles or mirrors. Because it doesn’t require a steering wheel or pedals, Tesla has pushed the seating position back, giving it more of a lounge-like feel. It features a center armrest and a massive 21-inch touchscreen at the center. Yes, the doors open upwards, seemingly ignoring lessons learned from the Model X. Visually, this design is striking, alongside wheels that at first glance appear to be huge gold discs, but are actually normal 21-inch low rolling resistance Continental tires with half the sidewalls painted gold to match the center caps. This gives the illusion of a super thin low-profile tire, but in reality, it’s just paint.

However, it’s still uncertain how much of this will make it to final production. After waiting in line for a bit, I finally got to ride in the vehicle for a few minutes. I got in, and the screen prompted me to buckle my seatbelt. Once I did, the door automatically closed—quite smart. I then selected my destination on the screen, which seemed to be on a pre-mapped route, and the car started moving.

I've experienced self-driving Teslas before, but this time felt a bit more nerve-racking since there were people everywhere and no steering wheel in front of me. After overcoming the initial eeriness of being in a driverless car with no manual override, I began to take notice of my surroundings. I sat quite low to the ground, similar to a Model 3, but had more legroom since the seating was pushed back. There were even fewer physical controls than before; the only physical interface I found was for the window switches, located in the middle next to the cup holders. The doors could only be opened with a button on the enormous touchscreen.

Like other Teslas, this vehicle controls everything through the touchscreen, including the ability to watch movies while the car drives—because why not? You can view an unedited recording of my ride on the auto-focus channel, which I’ll link below.

The thing is, that was about all we learned. Shockingly, there were very few details actually shared about the car during the event, aside from three main points in various headlines. First, it will be fully unsupervised and self-driving capable. Second, it will be available for under $30,000. And third, it will utilize inductive wireless charging, meaning it can park over a charging pad to recharge—a feature that isn’t widely seen in vehicles, especially not those with large batteries. That was it: no additional numbers or specifications. Just a glimpse of the concept. I had countless questions after witnessing that.

After the announcement, I walked around and chatted with some Tesla engineers and team members who worked on the project. I ended up grilling them with questions. My first inquiry was about the lack of a steering wheel or pedals. I asked what would happen if an accident was imminent, and the car didn’t react in time—would there be a manual override? The answer was that there would be minimal on-screen controls available, but the goal was that manual intervention would never be necessary, which is certainly a noble aim. However, it’s hard to fathom this in the current world, where accidents happen.

Then, regarding wireless charging, I asked about its implementation. The main reason, again, is to make the vehicle completely autonomous. They want it so that people can own several vehicles that all drive around and charge themselves overnight. This eliminates the need for human intervention in the charging process. However, I wondered if there would at least be a charging port for supercharging or quick charging, and the answer was no. The vehicle won’t be able to use Tesla superchargers or make long road trips—it’s purely a taxi option. I was informed there are no plans for a front trunk—only a rear trunk was shown at this presentation—and there was no stated range or battery size.

What they did mention was their aim for maximum efficiency. They hope to achieve about 5.5 miles per kilowatt-hour, while some of the most efficient electric vehicles on the market today get around 3 to 4 miles per kilowatt-hour. If they achieve this, it could translate to a smaller battery size, possibly around 40 kilowatt-hours, instead of the typical 70 to 130 kilowatt-hours. It logically checks out that to create the cheapest and most efficient electric car, they must focus on these aspects, but it also poses significant challenges, especially considering the design choices like scissor doors and wireless charging.

The biggest red flag for me, however, was the timeline presented. Elon has a notorious reputation for ambitious timelines. He announced, “We’re going to have this vehicle out for $30,000 before 2027.” I doubt that’s feasible. If they manage to pull it off, I will shave my head on camera because I simply can’t see it happening. I want to remain optimistic, but the hurdles are substantial—regulatory approval for full self-driving capabilities and getting prices down amidst inflation, and successfully producing a vehicle with unconventional features, all within two years—it seems improbable. Tesla has promised fully autonomous self-driving for years and continually postpones it. 

Price-wise, I understand the ambition, but Tesla once promised a $35,000 Model 3 and only briefly shipped for that price before discontinuation. As for the Cybertruck, remember the initial stated price for the cheapest version? It was $39,000 about four or five years ago. What’s the current price for that model? It's around $95,000. So you can see where my skepticism arises.

Philosophically, there’s a question about the difference between this Robotaxi and a Model 3. Tesla has been claiming for years that the cars people are buying today will be capable of full self-driving, including the Model 3 and Model Y. It's unclear how different the Robotaxi will be. Sure, it lacks a steering wheel and has a different seating configuration, but if my Model 3 can potentially do the same tasks, I’d prefer the one that can connect to superchargers and transport people. 

Maybe in the future, it’ll be seen as old-fashioned to want a car with a steering wheel, but for now, the Robotaxi's main advantage is likely that it will be cheaper, smaller, and easier to operate within a fleet context. They have been selling the dream that the vehicle you own today can drive itself while you work, earning you money while you’re not using it, then return home to you. But will it actually fulfill those capabilities?

During the event, there was a moment that stood out. Elon mentioned that the Model 3 and Model Y will also feature full self-driving and added, “Don’t worry, Cybertruck too.” Then someone called out about Hardware 3, referring to older Model 3s, and he responded, “Let’s not get nuanced here.” 

So it seems Tesla intends all their cars will drive autonomously except for perhaps some older models. 

Lastly, they reminded us that they’re not just a car company but also an AI company by showcasing the Optimus humanoid robot. Throughout the event, these robots danced and performed pre-rehearsed demonstrations. They also interacted with attendees, serving drinks and snacks, and engaging with people.

I've previously shared my thoughts on humanoid robots and Tesla's Optimus. What we witnessed at the event was indeed impressive, moving beyond earlier displays. But then they took it a step further—having the robots engage in conversation. In one instance, a robot asked someone if they wanted chocolate and engaged in a brief exchange. It felt like a person was just speaking through a speaker; the robot even stuttered and made occasional human-like mistakes. 

Attendees noted that there were different voices amongst the robots, which raises questions. As of recording, Tesla has not acknowledged this at all. Engineers I spoke with noted that all language models run on-device, but skepticism remains about the extent of human control involved.

This led to a whispering doubt over how much of the event was authentic and how much was staged. It brought to mind the Disney Imagineering Labs experience where controllers operated robots for entertainment. Essentially, while impressive, there's significant human assistance involved here too, which is likely the case at Tesla's event as well. 

They are selling a vision of the future with these robots helping people with chores and tasks—essentially being companions. While AI is progressing rapidly, I believe that vision is still far-off.

To Tesla's credit, this event was bold. They demonstrated self-driving tech among crowds, showcased humanoid robots interacting, and even included a drone show. It all represented a hopeful vision of the future, although still largely conceptual. Despite this optimism for a future that could be more efficient and advanced than today, the challenges and timelines being pitched seemed overly ambitious.

The introduction of robots added doubt about the authenticity of the presentations—how much is real and how much is artificial? Increasingly, the focus shifted from the exciting potential of the future to questioning the veracity of the demonstrations.

If any company can bring this vision to fruition, it just might be Tesla, given their significant data-gathering capabilities from real-world use today. I’ll remain hopeful, but I’ll believe it when I see it. Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace!
