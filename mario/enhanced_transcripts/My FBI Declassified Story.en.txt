So I've made a few references over the past couple of years to that time the FBI visited the studio, and I was asked not to talk about it for what I feel are pretty obvious reasons. For years I haven't mentioned it, but it turns out I'm now finally able to tell that story. So here we are.

For those of you who don't know, we have a studio here in a larger building with multiple tenants. It’s not exactly an office building, but there is a front desk and security. I’ve been in this building long enough that we have a good relationship with them. We have one rule: if anyone shows up at the front desk asking for me, the security guy there, whom we’ll call Bob, doesn’t let them in. I have to come out and meet them to confirm that I’m expecting them, and then I bring them back to our studio. If someone randomly shows up and I don’t show up to meet them, then I wasn’t supposed to meet them. 

In June 2020, it was early in this new space we had, and it was around peak COVID. I had sent everyone home, so it was just me and Andrew coming into the studio to work on building furniture, making videos, and recording the podcast every week. I got here early one summer morning, started settling in, and then there was a knock on the door.

I opened the door, and it was Bob. He said, “Hey Marques, there are some people with badges at the front desk to see you. I didn’t let them in, but if you would like to, they’re up there.” Then he walked away. My first thought was confusion. I was like, what? What did I do that made someone with badges show up asking for me? I was a little concerned and unsure about what to think. I stood there for a solid minute, trying to decide whether to go up there or stay in the studio without asking who the people with badges were. Eventually, I decided to go to the front.

When I got there, sure enough, there were three people with badges, and they walked right up to me and flashed their badges—FBI, just like in the movies. They said, “Marques, good to see you. We’ve got some questions for you about the Escobar phone.” 

Immediately, I felt relieved, but then it clicked—oh, the Escobar phone. A few months earlier, I had published a video about the Escobar Fold. If you haven't seen that video, the story is about a company selling a $400 gold folding phone that they claimed would rival Apple and Samsung. They had insane marketing campaigns, but as I uncovered in my video, they were just covering Samsung Galaxy Folds with gold stickers and shipping them to YouTubers they thought would talk positively about it, while scamming regular customers out of their money.

Looking back, I don’t know how they thought they would get away with it. Their whole plan backfired when I made that video. Fast forward a couple of months, and it makes sense that the FBI and IRS were interested. I just didn't expect them to show up one day, but here we are. Shout out to Bob at the front desk for sticking to our rule, even though he probably had a bunch of people flashing FBI badges at him.

So I brought them back to our spot, and they asked a lot of questions about that video and any communications I had with the company. They wanted every email I had ever sent or received from them. At that time, Andrew had just started running the business email account here. When they asked if anyone else on my team had ever communicated with this company, I thought Andrew might have. He had just arrived at the studio and walked up to the front door, so I called him in. The first thing he saw was me in an empty studio with a bunch of people in suits waving him over—definitely a funny alternate perspective on this story.

The FBI took the half-peeled Escobar Fold and the scratched gold iPhone from my videos as evidence in the case. They asked for them and took them away, putting them in sealed plastic bags that said "evidence." That’s why I mentioned at the end of the smartphone awards that year an honorable mention to the Escobar Fold 2, which is also not on my desk because it’s in the possession of the FBI. Someday, I’ll be able to tell that story.

As the FBI and IRS were leaving, they asked me not to talk about this publicly. I assured them I wouldn’t interfere with the investigation. I also asked how long before I would be allowed to talk about it, and they said, “We’ll let you know.” So for years, I’ve been biting my tongue, hinting at it a little but not saying anything too serious. 

Since then, many of the dominoes have started to fall. Initially, when the scam was happening, PayPal stopped working with them, so they switched to a non-refundable direct transfer process with Klarna, and then they stopped working with them too. Eventually, the entire operation began to collapse, and the guy at the head of it, named Olaf Gustafsson, ended up getting arrested and going to prison in Spain for fraud, money laundering, and a variety of other crimes—all related to what I discussed in those videos.

I've been holding onto this, wondering if it was okay to talk about it now that he was behind bars. We reached out to the same FBI agents who left their cards, and they confirmed it was fine to discuss it. Unfortunately, there’s no footage of the incident, but there are documents they provided as proof that they received my property for the case: one Pablo Escobar Fold 2 mobile flip phone (aka Samsung) and one Pablo Escobar Gold iPhone 11 Pro.

Now you basically know the story! It’s a pretty serious business, making videos about phones sometimes. If Olaf ever gets charged in the U.S., it’s likely my videos will show up in those court documents, which is quite crazy. Additionally, the phones they took may appear as evidence.

I do want to get back into making more investigative deep-dive type videos. Thankfully, giant scams don't happen frequently in the tech world, but they are fascinating stories when they do arise. By the way, that’s not the only encounter we've had with the FBI while running this YouTube channel, but that’s another story for another day.

If you want to hear more fun stories like this one, let me know in the comments. The latest bonus episode of the Waveform podcast features more stories like this from the past couple of years at the studio—it's a fun story time episode. So go over there, subscribe, and watch that. Anyway, that’s basically it. Thanks for watching. Catch you next time. Peace.

It’s a story of how I became a villain. For at least 24 hours, I was hated. 

- A couple of weeks, I would say.
- Yeah, oh really? A couple of weeks.

Well, oh, because the video had to come out. Hang on a second; I'm gonna go get him. I literally waited there with all my bags, and like this guy disappears into this booth, comes back with another guy.

He goes, “Hi. Oh, good to meet you,” and now he’s filming me. 

- Oh no.
- So now he’s filming me.

A couple of weeks later, I log into YouTube, and everyone on Twitter is like, “Why is Marques such a jerk?”
