So this is Cleo, and as you can probably tell, Cleo is an awesome dog. She’s one of the nicest dogs I’ve ever met. She loves people and anyone who will give her food. She exhibits all the classic dog traits, and she also happens to be missing her right leg. Cleo was found on Petfinder after spending some time as a stray in Oklahoma with injuries from unknown causes.

While playing with Cleo, you'd almost forget she's missing a leg because she runs around, chases things, and loves to play fetch. She enjoys being outdoors, embodying typical dog behavior. However, although she appears super healthy now, pets missing limbs, including dogs, are more likely to develop conditions like arthritis and joint problems in their other limbs later in life since they compensate for the missing limb. While Cleo is thriving now, it’s ideal for her long term to receive proper support, which is where a company called 3D Pets comes in.

They reached out to me to share their high-tech solution to this issue, and I was excited to see it. This story, like many others, highlights how technology is intertwined in so many aspects of life. Even my initial assumptions about the use of tech in helping dogs like Cleo were exceeded by what I learned.

The process is multi-step. First, a pet comes into their studio, located in New Jersey, where they use a smartphone to 3D scan the animal. They take several scans using either the iPhone's LIDAR scanner, the true depth camera system, or both. This isn’t exactly the intended use for those devices, but with apps like Combed and Hedges, it turns out to be a clever solution for measuring.

Once Cleo holds still long enough, they can achieve a reasonably accurate scan of her dimensions, including how high off the ground she is, how her prosthesis needs to be shaped, and other specifications. All of this information is utilized in the next step: 3D printing the prosthesis, which is incredible.

At first, I questioned why so much technology was involved in this process and why they were 3D scanning the animal to then 3D print the prosthesis. The explanation is that every animal's circumstances are unique. No two are the same, whether due to the reason for limb loss or variations in size, shape, and weight-bearing capacity. Each animal is almost like a fingerprint. Therefore, it's impossible to mass-produce a one-size-fits-all prosthetic. The goal is to make the prosthesis as custom, bespoke, and comfortable for each animal as possible. The 3D printing process allows for rapid iterations, enabling them to create multiple versions until they achieve the perfect fit.

3D Pets has collaborated with over 300 animals so far at their studio. They start with a candidacy form on their website, and once approved, they have a variety of options. While many of their clients are dogs, they have also worked with ducks, a tortoise, a pig, and even a goat that was missing part of its skull. They created a helmet for that goat, as well as a prosthetic leg for an elephant.

Cleo's scan was relatively straightforward, and within five minutes, they had several accurately modeled designs to work from, which they then imported into the design software. The next step is to get the scan from the phone onto their web portal, allowing them to bring it into custom design software, where the magic really happens. This software enables them to mold the design to the specific 3D scan of each pet, ensuring a perfect fit for Cleo.

They overlay Cleo's scan to patch things up as necessary, which is similar to using 3D Photoshop. They can adjust the lattice structure, hardware mounts, and strap placements tailored for Cleo. Once they’re satisfied with the design, they transfer it to another software for optimization before printing. This involves fine-tuning the intricacies and details of each layer, determining where they need rigidity for hardware mounts and where flexibility is needed for comfort around vital areas.

Once everything is finalized, they take it over to one of their several 3D printers, which vary in size depending on the case and the animal's needs. After the design is printed—literally about 24 hours later—the final step includes sanding down the corners to ensure comfort. They also remove support pieces used in 3D printing and are working on ways to repurpose those materials for other uses.

For example, one of the dogs they helped has a residual limb, so they strategically positioned the prosthesis to maintain weight-bearing below where the limb used to be. They employ a sanding and torching method to smooth the material, making it comfortable. One of their specialties is the design of prosthetic feet, which must compress to absorb the dog's weight as they step. They continuously iterate on their designs based on feedback, such as adjusting the foot design for greater durability.

After designing Cleo’s prosthesis, it was time for the final fitting. What I didn’t realize is that you don’t just attach the prosthesis and expect the dog to immediately run around as if it’s been there their whole life. There’s an adjustment process to help the dog become accustomed to it. I watched Cleo learn in real-time how to trust her new leg. The adjustment involves gradually increasing the time she spends using it daily, starting with 20 minutes, then an hour, and so on. By the end of the process, she learns to rely on it fully.

This experience was eye-opening for me, showcasing a remarkable win for pets like Cleo. It’s also fascinating that this technology is accessible, utilizing devices we already have like smartphones, along with software and 3D printers. 3D Pets began their venture with this combination and have since helped numerous animals. They are now considering the possibility of remotely creating prostheses for pets that can’t visit the studio in person by sending a mold instead.

While I'm not an expert on 3D printing or prosthetics, I hope this knowledge aids more animals in extending their lives and enjoying greater freedom. These prostheses typically range from a couple of hundred dollars to about $2,000 and ideally last a lifetime, provided the pet has stopped growing.

So, thanks to 3D Pets for sharing their innovative approach and technology, to Cleo for letting me hang out all day, and to you for watching. See you in the next one! Peace.
