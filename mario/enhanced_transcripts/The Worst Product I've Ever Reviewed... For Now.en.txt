- All right, so this is the Humane AI Pin. It is a brand new product and a really interesting form factor of an ultra-futuristic wearable computer. In a time filled with crazy gadgets like Vision Pro and wearable glasses, it's exciting to have genuinely new first-generation products like this to explore. Unfortunately, I must say, it's also the worst product I think I’ve ever reviewed in its current state. There are just so many issues with it that it becomes distracting to understand the device’s purpose. So, for this video, I’ll separate the content: first, I’ll explain what the device is and what it’s supposed to do, and then I’ll share my personal experience using it.

So, this device is a small, wearable computer with an AI inside that can assist you throughout your day. It's about the size of a large watch. It features a camera and a microphone and can interact with the world around you. Additionally, if you can't use those as input, there’s also a touch pad and a projector with a new style of gesture control that projects onto your hand. It costs $700, plus a $24 monthly subscription plan for the data and services that come with it. The $700 price tag, along with the subscription, already makes for an interesting start.

One major point to note is that this device does not pair with your smartphone at all. This is a standalone device with its own internet connection and phone number. So, this little AI assistant goes everywhere with you, always connected, allowing you to choose how much or how little you want to use it alongside your smartphone. At face value, that sounds like a cool idea: you talk to it like a person, it answers questions, provides historical facts, or personalized recommendations, and helps with brainstorming or remembering things. It can even make phone calls and send text messages—a lot of features. 

However, the unfortunate reality is that using this thing is burdensome enough that you won’t really want to do much of that alongside your phone. But we’ll delve into that shortly.

Let’s start with the hardware. The build quality of this device is genuinely impressive. If you’re looking for a reason to feel like you’re not getting ripped off, the hardware packaging achieves that. The pin is solid, made of aluminum, and feels dense. There are three colors available: matte black, which is the cheapest option, or for an additional hundred dollars, you can choose white or this black and silver model that I’m using. There’s a lot of technology packed into this device, including a camera, microphones, lights, and a tiny class 2 laser projector. The magnets that secure everything together are also super strong. 

The back of the pin features a component called a "booster." It has its own internal battery, but once you attach it to your clothes, it cleverly magnetizes through the fabric. You receive two of these boosters, and since the pin has an internal battery, you can hot-swap between them to keep the device powered. Very clever! Additionally, it comes with a well-made and highly reflective charging case, as well as a desktop charging puck where you can magnetize either the battery or the entire pin at once. That amounts to a lot of charging-related accessories, but they all come with the product.

This pin also includes lights at the top that illuminate whenever you use it, as well as a small notification light for alerts. The craftsmanship of this product is very evident in the weight of the components, the strength of the magnets, and how everything connects seamlessly. This is, by far, the best aspect of the pin.

Now, let’s try to forget about your smartphone for just a moment. This little pin can do a lot and is quite helpful. Think of it as an AI assistant that's right by your side all the time. You can ask it questions without a wake word since it activates the microphone when you touch it.

For example, you could say, “How tall is the Empire State Building?” and once you let go, it sends that query off to the cloud. 

- [AI Pin] “The Empire State Building is 1,454 feet tall to the tip.”

It’s also multimodal, which means it uses the camera to interact with the world around you. You could say, “Look and tell me what you see,” and the AI will scan the room, take an image, analyze it, and report back:

- [AI Pin] “You are sitting in front of a camera and a laptop. The camera is on a tripod and pointed at you. The laptop is open, and you are looking at it. There are three pictures of dogs on the wall behind you. There is a window to the left of the camera. There is a boom mic on the table in front of you. There is a red carpet on the floor.”

The camera can also take pictures and up to 15-second videos, which automatically upload while charging. It can remember things you tell it to and all of this information is accessible through the Humane Center—a web portal for everything connected to the pin. There is no app; it's just a website. Here, you can view a complete history of calls, texts, and what you’ve engaged with, along with items you've asked it to remember. 

Probably the most impressive feature is the translation function. By using a two-finger gesture, you can say something in another language, and it will auto-detect and translate back. For instance:

- [AI Pin] “Where’s the library?”

This AI can also assist in loud or private areas where voice interaction isn’t ideal by using its projector. When you activate the projector, your palm becomes a projection screen. You hold your hand flat, and the UI projects a green 720p mini-screen onto your hand. Interaction involves certain gestures, like rolling your hand to select an item or pinching to confirm. 

This is definitely a new concept, and while it might require some practice, it's fairly intuitive. For unlocking, you’ll even move your hand through space to select numbers, which feels almost magical the first time you try it. However, it's important to note that the device is still slow and inaccurate.

(mellow instrumental music)

Unfortunately, the AI Pin struggles in its performance across many tasks. Where do I even begin? It’s supposed to answer questions, which it can do at times, but one major issue is that it's often slow because most requests go to the cloud. There can be a long wait for responses. Moreover, the AI can frequently be incorrect; it can hallucinate or misunderstand information, leading to erroneous answers. This is compounded by server timeouts, especially if your internet connection is poor, which often happens in my studio. 

When observing demonstrations on their website and in videos, they would ask a question and fill silence with conversation to mask how long it takes to receive an answer. Even on fast studio Wi-Fi:

- AI Pin: “Who designed the Washington Monument?” 

- [AI Pin] “Finding designer.” 

- [AI Pin] “The Washington Monument was designed by Robert Mills, a prominent 19th-century American architect from South Carolina. The construction was eventually completed by—”

You can interrupt by holding your hand up to get the answer, but even that was a decent response given an ideal connection. Many of the time, it operates slowly, mostly relying on the cloud. 

In contrast, I can ask the time, and it responds rapidly:

- [AI Pin] “11:42 AM.”

But for everything else, it feels like a sluggish connection to the cloud— 

- [AI Pin] “What’s the next Nets game?” 

- [AI Pin] “Finding next Nets game. The next Brooklyn Nets game is on Sunday, April 14th, but no specific opponent or location is provided.” 

I just checked Google, and it says they are playing the 76ers, which is odd. 

When asking about traffic directions, the response is entirely unhelpful:

- [AI Pin] “Finding direction. Use the voice command feature of AI Pin to ask for traffic information...” 

This happens continuously. 

Now, speaking of battery life—it's really bad and inconsistent. It’s already frustrating to have to charge yet another device daily, but with this, you need to constantly monitor the battery, swap out boosters, and keep the device charged multiple times a day. 

I’ve had the pin drain an entire booster battery in just two hours while barely using it, while on other occasions, it lasted around four hours with extensive use. It's also constantly warm, which is concerning. At various times, I’ve experienced overheating, being prompted to wait for it to cool down. 

I suspect this heat issue arises from the gap created by the cloth between the booster and the pin. While the engineering is impressive, wireless charging tends to be inefficient and generates heat, and this device is no exception. Consequently, it creates a constant, somewhat uncomfortable sensation of wear on my chest alongside its weight. 

Despite its high-quality build and impressive hardware, it does weigh a little too much. I would prefer using lighter materials since the pin starts pulling down when adorned with lighter fabric, especially in warm weather. They do offer optional lighter accessories, but you never really forget that you’re wearing it.

The AI Pin also cannot set a timer or an alarm. The notification light, positioned in the corner, functions but is often out of my peripheral vision, making it easy to miss. Additionally, since it’s designed to be pinned on one side of the body, that area often faces issues in real-world situations like seat belts.

The photos it takes are subpar, the videos are even worse, limited to a square ratio, and very noisy, maxing out at just 15 seconds. The central hub where everything syncs with can abruptly stop functioning, requiring a refresh to get it back. 

As impressive as the projector may be technically, it lacks readability. Its brightness diminishes outdoors and becomes more difficult to interpret the further it gets from your hand. Without prior knowledge, I can barely read what’s projected.

Finally, there are no apps available. Upon signing up for a Humane account, you can sync it with four accounts: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Tidal for exclusive music access. However, there’s no Uber access, Spotify, WhatsApp, calendar, or Gmail functionality. This limits purchases or booking of flights, contrary to what we do all on our phones.

Despite outlining many downsides, the most significant challenge the pin faces is that smartphones are still far superior. Throughout my week of using this pin, I’ve been reminded that smartphones aren’t going away anytime soon. Many online comments mirror this sentiment even without testing the device, noting the considerable overlap between what the pin does and what modern smartphones achieve.

Everything this pin accomplishes, your smartphone can do better, faster, easier, and at higher quality. Smartphones take better photos and videos, allow for easier communication, and work in various environments. For quick queries, you can just Google answers faster from your phone.

For instance, if I ask the AI Pin to send someone a picture, it takes the photo, but then needs to either use voice commands or a gesture to show the picture, which appears as a low-quality green JPEG on your hand. Sending it then requires additional steps and results in just a link to view the image in the Humane web portal. 

The users enjoy an extremely streamlined experience on smartphones, and I would often find myself in situations where I waited for a response from the pin while my phone sat right beside me, ready for instant answers. 

Moreover, while I appreciate the concept of talking to a virtual assistant, it must have insight into your preferences and schedule to be effective. Your smartphone has all that knowledge, while this standalone device isn’t connected at all. That leaves this pin operating at a severe disadvantage in terms of usefulness. 

You can immerse yourself completely and try to teach it everything about you, but ultimately, it won’t generate relevant recommendations or reminders seamlessly. Much like sending texts or making calls, it cannot see the entire conversation history on the device. There will always be a gap.

This leads us back to the essential question: why didn’t they make this connect to your phone? I believe Humane aims for this product to evolve into a powerful standalone device in the future. However, to achieve that, they cannot establish a precedent of connectivity to smartphones, as it would imply removing this feature down the road.

This device, in its current form, seems limited by its intended future. It’s comparable to the Vision Pro, which also exists as a standalone computing device with no direct pairing with an iPhone.

Creating a title for this video presented challenges. At one point, I considered calling it, “This product is either the dumbest thing ever, or I’m just an idiot.” It’s undeniably flawed right now but occasionally, and I mean very occasionally, the AI Pin would perform its function seamlessly, offering a glimpse into what it could be.

For example, I’ve often noted the best ideas come when I'm unable to write them down—like when I’m about to sleep, showering, or driving. So, one day while driving to the studio, an idea struck me, and instead of pulling out my phone, I opted to use the pin:

- [AI Pin] “Remind me of this cool ABC outro idea for the Humane review.”

While still driving, it successfully recorded my thought.

- [AI Pin] “Saving memory.” 

Then, upon arriving at the studio, that reminder was waiting for me in the Humane AI Center. 

Additionally, the ability to capture unique first-person videos while driving is quite intriguing. Even though the quality isn’t stellar, the convenience of doing so without distraction is appealing.

So, if you ask who should buy this device right now, the honest answer is nobody should. However, if there’s one type of user who might consider it, it’s someone looking to minimize screen time and reduce reliance on their phone. Occasionally, I relate to that sentiment and prefer avoiding doom-scrolling in my downtime. 

Yet, with this device, the added friction and annoyance often deter you from that ideal of reduced screen time and purposeful living. For example, while traveling recently, I woke up dreading the idea of dealing with the pin. 

 I had driving ahead, which posed issues with the seatbelt, airport security, and constant reattachment of the pin—requiring my login again and again. With all this trouble, I simply chose to leave it behind. 

Ultimately, you should probably skip this product too, especially when considering future promises of updates. Admittedly, this is a product with a long way to go, and I respect the attempt to innovate. It’s not often we see something truly groundbreaking. 

However, there is significant improvement needed, and while they have shared a roadmap for improvements, the lack of timeline leaves uncertainty. 

So, good luck to them. Thanks for watching, and catch you in the next one. Peace.
