All right, it's finally here. This is the Apple Vision Pro, marking the beginning of Apple's spatial computing journey. It’s their first headset—whether you call it AR, VR, or a wearable face computer. This is the unboxing.

Everything shown in this box represents what you would receive should you decide to spend $3,500, or in this case, $3,900, for the 1TB Vision Pro. You'll see the accessories, and we’ll boot it up for the first time. This is the very start of our Apple Vision Pro investigation and series of videos, so definitely subscribe to be among the first to see when the rest are released.

The box is big, but the headset is relatively small. Shout out to JerryRigEverything for the knife. (tape tearing) 

Inside, we have a really soft box. There’s a smaller box within it. 

Now, we have three things: the Vision Pro headset, the Vision Pro Zeiss lenses—these optical inserts are for those with prescriptions. They magnetically attach to the headset, so if you wear glasses, you can still use it—and the optional $200 Vision Pro Travel Case. This has a distinct aesthetic; I'll get to that in a moment.

Now, let’s see the headset itself. (gentle music) 

It's about the size of a Mac box, maybe even larger than the Mac Studio box. It has pull tabs, and I expect good packaging as this is a high-pressure first-gen product for Apple. 

(gentle music continues)

It's like opening a shoebox. Here’s the headset, which comes with a little protective cover and is adorned with one of the bands you've seen in commercials. This is the Solo Knit Band, made of a soft, stretchy fabric. There’s also another band called the Dual Loop Band that likely comes with this headset too.

Let’s set that aside for now and see what else is in this shoebox-sized box. 

This first piece is a "Designed by Apple in California" pamphlet. I bet there are stickers in here. Oh, a microfiber cloth! There’s also the Light Seal Cushion. It looks like you get a thin and a thick Light Seal. 

At the top, there’s a bunch of documentation—more heavy Vision Pro paperwork—and here’s the Dual Loop Band, which goes around the back and over the top of your head for comfort.

Now, the battery that comes with the Vision Pro is heavy and all white. (cover ripping) It has a white braided cable, with a proprietary connector at the end that plugs into the side of the headset. This is a two and a half to three-hour battery with 3,166 milliamp hours. Interestingly, many smartphones with 5,000 milliamp-hour batteries feel lighter.

To charge the battery, there’s a USB-C cable and a wall brick. The wall brick is 30 watts—not the fastest, but decent. It includes a C to C braided cable as well.

That’s it for the inside of the box. Now, let’s go through these accessories. 

Let's start with the paperwork, as most will encounter this. There’s a booklet outlining what's in the box and a sort of guide on pairing it to your iPhone, how to wear it for the first time, and connecting the straps. It even shows how to store the cable around the battery—make sure to wrap it horizontally with some slack.

I bet there are stickers. The polishing cloth is nice and thin, different from the one that comes with the monitors. The front of the headset is glass, so this microfiber will be handy for cleaning it—something I plan to keep.

When you buy the Apple Vision Pro, you need to undergo a face-scanning process using your iPhone's Face ID sensors to measure depth and scan around your eyes and face. This results in a custom-fitted Light Seal. The Light Seal Cushion can be either thin or thick, depending on your optical needs.

Now let’s take off the protective covering from the Vision Pro. It features a standard head size. Upon removing the covering for the first time, you’ll see the glass. It’s reflective in bright light, but it's clear why people will want to carry the Vision Pro cloth, which has "Vision Pro" on the microfiber.

When you get the headset, you’ll notice two things: first, this is the thicker version of the Light Seal—this thinner version pops off—and second, there’s the custom Light Seal that can be removed, leaving you with the computer itself. It’s compact, akin to other VR headsets, but it has an aluminum housing and numerous sensors. The Light Seal is designed to fit your face and block out light, attaching like the AirPods Max covers.

Now, let's explore the Dual Loop Band. There’s been much discussion about the Vision Pro's weight, prompting Apple to include two bands. Different sizes are available, so I have both mediums.

There are two loops—one goes over your head, and one around the back. I’m going to put the Solo Knit Band on for the first time without boots to demonstrate. Adjusting it is straightforward; you can tighten it with a simple crank. The weight predominantly rests on the front and can rest on your cheeks and forehead.

Switching bands is easy. You just pull this orange tab to release the Solo Knit Band from the Vision Pro. The headset has small pods over each ear that house speaker drivers, which are dense and surprisingly heavy.

To attach the other band, it follows the expected process, using Velcro to adjust the height. After making adjustments, it feels more balanced and comfortable.

Now, let’s take a look at the travel case. This isn’t just a protective layer; it helps keep the glass safe from fingerprints and other issues. It has a handle, and when expanded, it's well-designed; it opens up to reveal molded spaces for the headset and battery. 

There are designated spots for the cable, power brick, and USB-C charging cable. The case even has an activated carbon deodorizer (do not eat). 

Using this case makes sense; I’d want protection for the headset during travel. I'm particularly looking forward to using the Vision Pro on airplanes, so I’ll need a spacious backpack.

Let’s boot it up for the first time. Here’s the process when you get your Vision Pro: Open the case, get the battery out first, retrieve the headset, choose between the thick or thin Light Seal, and select your band.

The battery has a fixed cable that doesn’t appear removable. To connect the headset, you line up a dot on the side with a corresponding mark, twist it, and it will glow, indicating it's booting up.

It takes about a minute, and soon after, you’ll enter the setup process.

(gentle startup music)

I see a checkbox. How do I look? Ridiculous? Decent? I can see you all. The headset shows a hello prompt, but I’m going to save the complete setup and the use of Vision Pro for the next video.

Lastly, let me show you the Zeiss lenses. If you wear glasses or have a prescription, you can use this headset with these lenses. They are quite small, magnetic, and here’s how you attach them. 

(lenses snapping)

It's a strong magnet. Once attached, you scan a code with the headset to inform it of your prescription, adjusting accordingly, which is a well-thought-out feature.

I think that wraps it up for now. Stay tuned and subscribe for more videos on setting up and using the Vision Pro. I'll be covering everything from weight distribution to the experiences it offers, including games, movies, and apps.

Finally, a big shout-out to the sponsor of this video, Anker. If you’re considering the Vision Pro, you probably already have an iPhone, so it’s worth looking into Anker's new MagGo lineup. 

Their Wireless Charging Station is a compact three-in-one solution that’s lightweight and can charge multiple devices at once. 

Another great option is the MagGo Power Bank, which attaches via MagSafe to your phone. It features a built-in 10,000 milliamp battery, allowing you to charge your iPhone nearly two full times on the go.

Both devices support up to 15 watts of wireless charging and are compatible with Qi2, making them versatile options. So definitely check them out. The link is in the description.

Thanks for watching, and I’m off to set up my Vision Pro now. Catch you in the next video. Peace.
