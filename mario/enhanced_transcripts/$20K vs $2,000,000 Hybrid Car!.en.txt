- In a world of electric cars, we’re going to take a look at a $20,000 hybrid, a $120,000 hybrid, and a $2 million hybrid car. This video serves as both an explainer and a chance to drive some incredible cars. Shout out to Triple F Collection—we’ll get there!

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve seen that electric cars are undergoing a renaissance, surging in popularity to the point where the number one best-selling new car on earth is electric. However, they are still very much a new technology. While they offer instant torque, no emissions, and fast acceleration, they come with heavy batteries that take a long time to recharge, and there isn’t enough infrastructure for everyone to own them. This creates a window where, for most people, a hybrid is actually the best option.

Now, I don’t think anyone is buying the Corolla for speed or power. If I'm being honest, it’s surprisingly zippy. The car starts at $24,000 and is a hybrid purely for efficiency. The basics of this hybrid system, and many others in the same category, is that the wheels can be driven by the gas engine, the electric motor, or both.

The Corolla hybrid has a 1.8-liter engine and one electric motor at the front axle, delivering a combined output of 138 horsepower, powered by a small 1.6 kilowatt-hour battery. At low speeds, you might have experienced this before—the car runs totally electric, and the gas engine shuts off. But once you exceed a certain speed or use a certain amount of power, the gas engine kicks in and works alongside the electric motor. Whenever you're braking or coasting, the battery recharges. As you slow down, it captures some of that energy, meaning it never actually needs to be plugged in to charge the small battery. This system achieves an impressive 50 miles per gallon.

When you drive this car, there's an eco score that gamifies efficiency. If you slow down and accelerate smoothly, you can maximize your miles per gallon. There’s a bar indicating your eco zone, and it’s satisfying to see it stay there. I've managed to get my eco score into the 70s—not to brag, but it’s pretty good! I wonder what happens when I reach 100, but I do know that a higher score translates to more miles per gallon.

Everything else about this car is designed for efficiency. It’s aerodynamic enough to slip through the air and has low rolling resistance tires, which aren’t designed to be sticky or grippy as that would hinder efficiency. 

If you're looking for a reason to buy a hybrid today, it’s that you don’t have to charge a large battery every night or rely on public chargers. It’s mainly about wanting better fuel mileage and spending less—though not zero—on gas.

As you know, these cars are utility-focused; they’re for people on the go. But what if you’re in the market for something more versatile? Let’s explore this next option.

This car starts at about $100,000, just over that, and it’s a hybrid designed for versatility. This is a BMW 750e. In this price range, you can benefit from both gas and electric options. 

This hybrid system has more hardware to achieve its goals. It features a three-liter straight-six engine producing around 300 horsepower and a medium-sized 14.4 kilowatt-hour battery, powering roughly 200 horsepower from the electric motor. In total, you can expect around 500 horsepower. 

Like the Toyota hybrid, this model can operate on gas or electric. However, the battery capacity is sufficient for about 30 miles of electric driving without firing up the gas engine. Unlike the Corolla, this is a plug-in hybrid, so you can plug it in at home to replenish the battery and drive with zero gas usage as needed.

Plug-in hybrids currently make sense for the most people. If you have a short 10-mile daily commute and can charge overnight or during the day, you could potentially never pay for gas again. Yet, if you need to drive farther or take a road trip, you can switch to gas power without issue. 

These hybrids also include regenerative braking, which helps recover energy once you're at speed, charging the battery as you drive. A little graph on the dashboard shows how energy is used and recuperated through braking.

Electric cars boast the party trick of instant torque, and hybrids benefit from that too. The BMW’s powerful motor and sizable battery mean that in sport mode, you receive an electric boost on acceleration, followed by the power surge from the gas engine.

I've often said that heavy cars are the best candidates for electrification. Therefore, this large luxury sedan, with its spacious, cushy interior, is an excellent example. The i7 from BMW fits this mold perfectly. There are also various versions like the RAV4 and Toyota Prius Prime plug-in hybrids. 

If I were to recommend a single version for most people, this would be it. You get plush suspension, all the tech, and smooth driving. You don’t even need to have a plug in your garage.

It’s versatile, and this is what they call the ultimate driving machine. But of course, you can always spend more, and when you do, you enter the territory of special vehicles, like this one.

Just give me a second.

- This car costs $2.5 million and it's a hybrid purely for performance. You can probably tell just by looking at it, and certainly from the fact that I’m sitting in the middle of the car now. I need to get used to this driving position. 

This is the McLaren Speedtail. McLaren has done this before—one center driver’s seat with two passenger seats. The hybrid system here is designed to maximize power while minimizing weight. There’s a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 engine delivering over 750 horsepower, paired with a small but powerful 1.6 kilowatt-hour battery that drives a single electric motor, adding an extra 300 horsepower. So in total, you exceed 1,000 horsepower.

This car has no electric-only mode; the gas engine never turns off, and there are no efficiency goals. It’s similar to the turbocharged hybrid systems seen in Formula 1 today—focused purely on speed.

A few of the over-engineered features include cameras instead of side mirrors for optimal aerodynamics and electrochromic glass for the roof and windshield. The active aerodynamics even bend the carbon fiber bodywork during braking, enhancing the vehicle's deceleration.

This car is also unique in that it features wireless charging. That’s right—the McLaren Speedtail wirelessly charges! The small battery means that if the driver doesn’t park perfectly over the charger in their garage, it’s not a huge issue, as it can still recharge over time, despite the inefficiency of inductive charging.

The exterior is sculpted for optimal air flow, enabling it to accelerate from zero to 186 miles per hour faster than a Bugatti Chiron and reach a top speed of 250 miles per hour. 

Let me share a little secret about these super-fast electric cars: they require large batteries to achieve that performance. For instance, the Tesla Model S Plaid generates 1,000 horsepower but relies on a hefty 100 kilowatt-hour battery to sustain that power without quickly draining. This is why high-horsepower electric cars are often heavy.

In contrast, a supercar like the Speedtail sacrifices battery size for weight and power, allowing for a tiny battery that delivers massive power in short bursts.

Let me demonstrate. I currently have 100% battery; let’s see how much it drops after a brief acceleration.  
(engine revving)  
That just took me down to 74% battery! But it’s already back up to almost 100% because I’m recuperating energy as I drive.

This technology is cutting-edge and has parallels with Formula 1. The F1 cars we see on TV today operate with small turbocharged hybrid powertrains. 

In summary, while fully electric vehicles are the future, it’s clear that hybrids remain a practical choice for many—and they’ve been right under our noses all along. That’s about it. I got your driver's speed deal.
