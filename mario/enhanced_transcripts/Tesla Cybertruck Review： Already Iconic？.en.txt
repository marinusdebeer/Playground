The most dangerous thing about the Tesla Cybertruck is not the pointy edges and corners. It's not the fact that it weighs over three tons and goes from zero to 60 miles per hour faster than a Corvette. It's not even the way reflections glare off the stainless steel and can blind people on the highway. No, the most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck is the way it makes other people on the road behave.

Okay, I genuinely can't tell if the Cybertruck is good looking or not, and I'm being completely serious. If you check the comment section online, it's mostly negative. Most people say it looks horrible, like a refrigerator on wheels, and that it’s a disaster of design. But once you start living with this thing, driving around and talking to people who have never heard of it, they often say things like, "This is crazy. This is like a movie prop. It’s sci-fi; it looks like something alien." 

So, there’s a lot to consider. First of all, you have stainless steel and black plastic—that's mostly the materials involved. The front has a good angle; I'm a sucker for a light bar, though the actual headlights are placed lower to avoid blinding others. Overall, it has a square jawline—no curves, just angles. However, the back isn’t so appealing. While it's still technically a bar, I find it a bit lacking. Plus, there’s just a lot of black plastic in the back and an exceptionally high tailgate. It gives off dump truck vibes, which I don’t think many people would disagree with. I don’t think the back is its best angle. 

But if I had to narrow it down, I’m fairly certain that the most iconic profile is the side. The two elements that really stand out are the slope and high shoulders, along with the pointy corners on the other side. Most pickup trucks have a more traditional shape, so we’re not used to seeing this angular design and that enormous slope. It’s unusual, weird, and very visually interesting. 

After living with the Cybertruck for about a month and driving over 1,500 miles, you notice a few things. First, whenever you park, people always want to come up and talk about it. Naturally, I’ve entertained many of these conversations because they’re fun. They usually ask two things: First, you’d be surprised how many people have never heard of the Cybertruck. For us online people, it’s hard to imagine anyone not knowing about it, but it’s true. Secondly, most people just want to know, “How much does that thing cost?” I got asked that so many times that I eventually started having people guess. Every guess was too high, ranging from $150K to $300K. It’s understandable; they’ve only seen this unique vehicle for the first time, so they can’t know its actual cost. This tells me that the look of the truck is drawing attention away from everything else that defines the Cybertruck.

Now, let’s play a little game. I’m going to name a feature, and all you have to do is think about it for a second and decide whether you believe it’s overrated or underrated. Then I, someone who’s driven this truck, will tell you the real answer. 

First feature: steer-by-wire. This involves a complete physical disconnect between the steering wheel you're holding and the wheels moving under the truck. Instead, it’s driven by sensors reacting to your input, much like a video game controller. With the variable steering ratio and four-wheel steering, this feels like the most nimble, agile truck I’ve ever driven. I don’t think many people realize that, so I’d call it underrated. Tesla definitely didn’t have to implement this technology. They already made headlines with the design; it could’ve been a simple Model 3 underneath. Instead, they went through the effort to engineer a full steer-by-wire system that’s safe. I believe they’re the first to do this. 

The variable steering ratio is what enhances its utility. At low speeds, you can turn very quickly with minimal input, making parking and sharp turns so much easier. At highway speeds, it softens, allowing for a smoother driving experience. The addition of four-wheel steering allows this huge truck to pivot around a much smaller axis. The steering feels impressive for a vehicle of its size, and once you get used to it, driving something like an F-150 feels archaic by comparison. 

Next feature: bulletproof stainless steel. I’ll say overrated. Having a durable truck is undoubtedly useful, but claiming it’s bulletproof to nine-millimeter rounds? I’m not going to test that. There are some other YouTubers who will, and it can stop smaller rounds without being punctured. However, the glass windows aren’t bulletproof—they’re just stronger than regular glass, and the wheels and tires are still vulnerable to slashing. So don’t think this thing is invincible. That said, cold-rolled stainless steel is going to be much stronger than regular materials, protecting against minor accidents. It’s great for bumpers but also means your truck will show fingerprints easily. 

Plus, Tesla had to create new machines to manufacture and shape this material. That's why you don’t see many other cars made like this. As I mentioned in my Auto Focus review, the early production issues in low VIN Cybertrucks are not uncommon for Tesla. The early batches, like the dual-motor all-wheel drive model I received, can have panel gaps and other issues. For example, my driver’s side door had a growing gap that started making odd noises. Eventually, it broke because the bolts holding the latch weren’t tightened properly. Thankfully, my friend Miles taped it securely until it could be fixed. Elon Musk responded to the issue on Twitter, noting it affected only 15 trucks, so if you have this problem, you can get it fixed at a Tesla service center with an appointment. 

My Cybertruck has been flawless so far, but I believe early models will have issues, just like any other Tesla. Regarding the Cybertruck's features, many early adopters are willing beta testers. It should eventually make production cheaper and easier, but “eventually” is key here. 

Let’s move on to truck stuff. This refers to the reasons someone might logically buy a truck over other vehicles for towing, hauling, and off-roading. While the Cybertruck certainly looks capable, I think these capabilities are overrated. Don’t get me wrong; it’s way more capable than any other Tesla, handling winter weather well due to its heated windshield wipers and mirrors. It even has a wade mode that raises the suspension for deep water. However, when it comes to off-roading and towing, most people will likely use it primarily on the street, similar to an SUV. 

Consider this: 63% of truck drivers admit to rarely or never towing anything at all. For those who buy a truck specifically for towing, they already have short lists of trucks they’re considering, and none of them are electric. I believe millions of pre-orders for the Cybertruck are largely due to its novelty, making it many people’s first truck experience. While the Cybertruck looks massive, it’s actually smaller than an F-150. New owners may feel invincible in taking it off-road but might find themselves getting stuck in embarrassing situations, leading to criticism and exaggerated stories about the Cybertruck’s capabilities. 

We’ll be using the Cybertruck at our video production studio for hauling gear and other practical reasons, but I’m aware that many future owners will simply drive it on the street because it looks cool. 

Next category: performance. You might have seen Tesla’s clever YouTube video racing the Cybertruck against a Porsche 911 while towing one and winning. This taps into the EVs’ reputation for straight-line speed. However, comparing a pickup truck to a sports car isn’t typical. 

While EVs are quick, cars with traditional gears can often be faster. For instance, the Cybertruck’s best run recorded a 10.9-second quarter-mile, which is astonishing for a 7,000-pound pickup truck. The Cybertruck launches faster than a 911 Turbo S due to its weight and traction control system. Although it holds a lead initially, the Porsche eventually overtakes it as physics takes over with gear shifts. 

The Tesla video cleverly showcases the Cybertruck towing a Porsche 911 to emphasize its strength. However, it presents the outcome in a way that might not be entirely accurate regarding the distance covered in the race. 

To summarize, the Cybertruck is very quick off the line, but its performance is more suited for sheer speed rather than curves. This doesn’t take away from the appeal of its performance for many buyers. 

Now, let’s talk about the 800-volt architecture and 48-volt low-voltage system. I’m putting this in the underrated category; the Cybertruck is technically the lightest fully electric pickup truck in the world. It is lighter than the Hummer EV, the F-150 Lightning, and even the smaller Rivian R1T. 

However, I was expecting it to charge as quickly or faster than other Tesla models. It charges at about 250 kilowatts at V3 Superchargers for the initial third of the charging curve. Although this number might seem lower than expected, it’s influenced by the vehicle’s efficiency. 

I also want to emphasize the impressiveness of the Cybertruck’s suspension. There’s considerable travel between the lowest and highest settings, which is impressive. While it doesn’t drive like a sports car, it has a low and firm feel when adjusted appropriately. I found little body roll or yaw; it drives remarkably well for a large truck. 

Lastly, Tesla's minimalism in its design and controls remains a point of discussion. While many prefer physical buttons over digital ones, Tesla has minimized components to reduce manufacturing costs and complexity. However, I believe the Cybertruck could benefit from some physical controls, particularly for climate control and other functions, which would enhance user experience. 

Despite all the technical aspects, it’s still a Tesla at heart. It works with Tesla Superchargers and has a robust battery under the floor for a quiet interior that enhances sound quality. That said, there are currently missing features in these early models, such as the additional range extender battery, the light bar, and the locking differential in certain versions, just to name a few.

While driving to the studio recently, I noticed people's reactions to the Cybertruck. One biker glanced at it briefly and then waved as he rode past. Later, I was in traffic when a car pulled up next to mine, and to my surprise, four happy faces leaned out of the windows, waving thumbs up and grinning ear to ear. That’s about the ratio of joy to absolute disgust you bring into the world driving the Cybertruck—around 80-20.

So what’s the final verdict on the Cybertruck? There’s a lot to unpack in terms of materials, technology, and design. The Cybertruck’s design could be considered iconic, along with the baggage that comes with it. Iconic designs are often rare, like the Lamborghini Countach or Bugatti Veyron. 

Currently, the Cybertruck is rare, generating excitement when people see one, as it’s likely their first encounter. However, it’s set for mass production, which might lessen this novelty over time. There are over two million pre-orders for the Cybertruck, while there were only ever about 2,000 Countaches made. So it's hard to find a comparable vehicle that begins life as iconic but is mass-produced. 

I remember a comment on a previous video that compared the Cybertruck’s potential future to the PT Cruiser. Initially, it garnered attention for its unique design, but Chrysler produced over a million of them, normalizing their presence on the road. As they became commonplace, perceptions changed. 

So the question remains: will the Cybertruck follow the same path? Only time will tell. 

Thanks for watching, and catch you in the next one. Peace.
