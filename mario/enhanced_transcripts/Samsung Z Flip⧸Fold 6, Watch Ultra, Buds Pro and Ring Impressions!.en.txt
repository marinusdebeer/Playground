- Hey! What's up y'all?  
I'm MKBHD here.  
And today, Samsung had their expected summer Unpacked event in July, where they announced two new phones and three new wearable devices. Well, it’s more than that if you count the small and large sizes, but there was a lot of stuff. I got to go hands-on with all of it, so here are my first impressions.

I'm going to start with the two new phones. This was the reveal of the latest foldables: the Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6. In general, these phones are very much still minor iterations on last year's models. Shocker. I was thinking about that; it kind of feels dismissive to say, "Oh, Samsung settled; they're not really changing anything." While that’s somewhat true, these are still phones at the forefront of two of the most advanced areas in tech: foldables and AI.

So, the Fold 6, the larger model, looks just like the Fold 5. They’ve squared up the sides a bit, changed the camera housing slightly, and given it thinner bezels both inside and outside, making the cover screen a little more usable. Now both screens reach up to 2,600 nits of brightness. It’s powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, with a few new colors added, and that's about it. There are a couple of even smaller upgrades, like a slightly better hinge and a new ultra-wide camera. The squared sides provide a bit more interior volume, which allows for a 60% larger vapor chamber for better cooling, but aside from that, it has the same battery size, the same general form factor, the same under-screen camera on the inside—just a lot of the same stuff.

I think the real focus for this phone, and for the others, of course, is this new AI, the Galaxy AI they're pushing to the forefront. Similar to what Apple did a couple of months ago, they're trying to surface all the AI features they’ve been working on, bringing new capabilities to the top so that regular users can actually utilize them. They've branded it as Galaxy AI.

Now, in the settings app, right at the top, there’s a new Galaxy AI section filled with the latest features. Some of these are genuinely useful; others maybe not so much. For instance, Call assist can definitely be useful. The interpreter feature allows you to have back-and-forth conversations in different languages—that’s cool. Note assist helps summarize content in the Notes app, and Transcript assist will summarize voice notes. These features are pretty standard and have been seen before.

If you use Samsung’s browser instead of Chrome for some reason, you can hit that stars AI button to summarize any webpage with a lot of text. We've seen that before as well. The generative fill feature allows you to get extra information from a photo you’ve taken, and while it's not new, it’s now available in Samsung’s Gallery app. If you want to create a wider angle photo or straighten a horizon, it does a surprisingly good job at filling in the corners.

Then there’s Drawing assist, which can take something you sketch in Notes—even if you’re not the best artist like me—and generate art in various styles. It looks very similar to what Apple’s Image Playgrounds app does. The watercolor style is quite tame, but there’s also a 3D cartoon style that, if given some time, is honestly pretty impressive. I don’t know if it’s good art, but there’s definitely quite a lot you can create with it.

Moving on to the Z Flip 6, it shares a lot of the same updates as the Z Fold 6: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, squared sides, and a slightly refreshed design. Spec-wise, it aligns with the base S24, featuring the same camera setup with a 50-megapixel main camera and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide. The battery has increased from 3,700 to 4,000 mAh, which is promising, and the inside screen also hits 2,600 nits. There’s a wider variety of widgets for the outer screen, enhancing its usability, and for the first time, the Flip includes a vapor chamber and a base of 12 GB of RAM. It also sports new colored metal rings around the cameras for easy visual identification of the new model.

However, we’ll have to see if these phones and their folding screens age better than the previous generation. A slightly better hinge might help, but, as far as I can tell, they seem to have the same crease level and hinge feel, making them overall very similar to last year’s hardware package. The icing on the cake, though, is that these phones are both $100 more than last year. The Z Flip 6 will retail for $1,099 instead of $1,000, and the Fold will be $1,899 instead of $1,799. So, that’s the trend they’re following.

Then there’s the wearable tech they announced, which I think people might find even more interesting than the phone updates. This includes two new watches, two new earbuds, and a smart ring. The Galaxy Watch 7 receives a nice refresh, looking very familiar and starting at $299 for the 40 mm model. They've also introduced a new Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra in this lineup, which we had been expecting. This model features a titanium body, sapphire crystal display, and maintains the 1.5-inch circular display size of the 44 mm, but with a beefier body to accommodate a 590 mAh battery. It’s water-resistant up to 100 meters and includes a new watch face.

The Watch 7 and Ultra both come with dual-frequency GPS. Notably, the Ultra features a large orange button known as the Quick Button, which can be customized to start various activities or workouts. It’s clear this product targets the Apple Watch Ultra, and the pricing reflects that; it comes in at $650 compared to Apple’s $800.

My question is how they stack up head-to-head. Battery-wise, the Ultra may actually outperform the Apple Watch, claiming around 100 hours in power-saving mode. In terms of accuracy and features, we’ll have to wait and see. Samsung is also introducing a new concept that compiles all your health metrics into a single score—an Energy Score—using AI, which I’m keen to try out. 

They also announced the new Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 2 Pro, which have clear counterparts in other ecosystems but bring new cases and designs. People are saying they resemble the first-generation AirPods aesthetically, which is somewhat true, especially at the top. The Pro version has long stems fitted with blade lights to indicate different modes or statuses, which is a neat feature. The Pros are better than the regular buds, boasting features like Ambient mode, soft tips, and adaptive noise cancellation that adjusts based on your environment.

The Buds 3 are priced at $179 and the Buds Pro at $249. Last but not least, they unveiled the smart ring that had been teased months ago. It’s a 24/7 fitness tracker that you can wear all day, including when you sleep or swim—a device you’ll always have on you. I’ve never tested a smart ring before, so I’ll be curious to see how this one compares, especially against the Oura Ring, which is the industry standard.

The Samsung ring looks like other smart rings, featuring a minimal exterior with a slightly concave design to avoid scratches. It comes in three finishes—matte black, silver, or gold—and measures seven mm in width and 2.6 mm in thickness. The sensors are all located inside, measuring heart rate, skin temperature, and more. It’s also water-resistant up to 100 meters and boasts a battery life of about seven days, depending on size. When it runs low, you can place it in a clever charging case that lights up around the ring to show charging status. This case can provide roughly 1.5 times the total life of the ring before needing a recharge.

The price for the ring will be $399, which is $100 more than the basic Oura Ring, but this one does not require a subscription. The Oura typically charges around $6 a month, which adds up over time. With Samsung, you pay $399 upfront and receive all the features without any additional costs, but you’ll need a Samsung Galaxy phone and the Samsung Health app to use it.

So, I’m glad to see some competition without a subscription model. And that wraps up what Samsung announced today: two new phones, two new earbuds, two new watches, and the smart ring—all set to hit shelves soon and priced quite premiumly. Wow, that was an unintended alliteration! But yes, all this stuff is coming out shortly. Before you go, what if I told you this phone could be worth $1 million? It’s not, but let me explain what our channel sponsor, dbrand, has going on.

This is their latest drop called Case Hardened. If you’ve ever played "Counter-Strike," you’ll be familiar with the in-game economy for Case Hardened skins. Just last month, an AK-47 sold for over $1 million—actual dollars. This ultra-rare Blue Gem skin is about one in 21 million. 

I know real "Counter-Strike" fans might point out that dbrand’s Case Hardened isn’t entirely random and that no real Blue Gems exist, but here’s the twist: like in the game, dbrand created thousands of Case Hardened patterns, some of which are actual random Blue Gems. It won't be quite one in 21 million, but they look fantastic. Both designs have a metallic sheen, making the back of your phone visually interesting instead of just the front. 

I’ll leave a link in the description below if you want to check it out and upgrade your device. Samsung doesn’t typically go bold with colors. So, yeah, that’s it! Let me know what you think of these new devices and wearables and which ones you’d like to see reviews of first. Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you on the next one. Peace.
