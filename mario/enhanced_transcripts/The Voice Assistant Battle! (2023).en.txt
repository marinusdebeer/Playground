I've talked and made jokes in the past, mostly claiming that Google Assistant is clearly the best virtual assistant, with Bixby, Siri, and Alexa trailing behind at various levels. However, the last time I conducted this type of test was in 2017. So, I figured we should revisit this, retest things, and see if Google Assistant still holds the title of the best virtual assistant on a smartphone today.

I also want to give a shoutout to Clippy, the original virtual assistant, whose ugly Christmas sweater from Microsoft inspired this one, the MKBHD 8-bit Drip, available while supplies last at shop.mkbhd.com. They're very limited, so check it out via the link below.

To start, I focused on the simple questions—three things you often ask a virtual assistant: the weather, timers, and facts. All the assistants performed adequately with weather inquiries, which is probably the number one query for me. They also answered standard facts fairly quickly, although there was a discrepancy regarding the height of one person. However, when it came to timers, for some strange reason, Siri cannot manage multiple timers simultaneously on the iPhone. If you have one timer running and ask for a second, it always asks if you want to replace the first timer. This seems like a basic issue Apple should have resolved by now, especially since you can set multiple timers on Siri when using a HomePod mini.

I don't want to bore you with a sequence of back-to-back questions and answers, as I admit it was somewhat dull during testing. Instead, I’ll share some examples and highlights of my findings regarding how these assistants respond during interactions.

With all the latest software updates across the assistants and all asked the same questions while on the same WiFi connections, the fastest responders were generally Google Assistant or Siri. However, Siri and Bixby experienced more instances of lag and didn’t always respond promptly, almost as if they were experiencing a poor internet connection—even when they weren't. A simple restart helped with Bixby, while Siri seemed to lag randomly, the reason for which I haven't identified yet.

When posed with straightforward fact questions, there was no clear winner, which I actually found reassuring. Questions that are easily searchable, like "How tall is the Taj Mahal?" or "What do whales eat?" prompted responses from all assistants that were mostly consistent. Siri tends to rely heavily on Wikipedia for its answers and usually provides a web search link when it goes beyond Wikipedia, saying, “Look what I Googled for you.”

Google Assistant is more likely to provide a visual and slightly extra information beyond what you asked. Since Bixby is powered by Google, it often reads what Google Assistant says word for word. Alexa is more inclined to throw in some additional information, like your latest Amazon order or something random.

When it comes to device control, there is a clear winner—actually, two: Google Assistant and Bixby. For basic tasks, all are capable. For instance, they can adjust screen brightness, open the camera, or launch apps with voice commands. Setting an alarm is simple; if you ask to open the app store, all will direct you to their respective stores. Notably, Bixby opens the Samsung Galaxy Store, which is a nice touch.

However, when tasks become more complex, Google Assistant and Bixby outshine the others. For example, when I asked to take a selfie, Siri and Alexa simply opened the camera, while Bixby and Google actually opened the camera, switched to the selfie mode, set a timer, and snapped the picture. Similarly, when asked to play "Squid Game" on Netflix, both Google and Bixby would open the app, locate the first unseen episode, and start playing it, whereas Siri just opened the app, and Alexa got lost in the process. 

If I asked Siri to initiate a voice recording or memo, again, Google and Bixby would open the recording app and start recording, while Siri just opened the app, and Alexa remained unresponsive. These voice commands were faster than I could have done it manually. Additionally, Bixby offers other device-specific features that may save you a lot of time with frequently used apps. It was strong in this area during my last assessment, while Alexa continues to lag in device control since it's not integrated within its own smartphones.

Now, let’s discuss conversational abilities. For example, when I asked, "Who is the coach of the Phoenix Suns?" the follow-up questions flowed naturally. Siri struggled to maintain the conversation after about four sequential questions, while Google Assistant excelled in remembering the context and maintaining the discussion over numerous questions in a row.

Conversational examples included inquiries about the Taj Mahal—where it is, its height, what it’s made of—and then smoothly transitioning into questions about the Weeknd, such as his birthday, latest album, and real name. Google Assistant is the best choice if you're looking to ask a series of related questions or want to research a topic thoroughly through voice commands.

When it comes to searching for pictures, all assistants can search the web, except Bixby, which didn’t. Alexa, oddly, searched for an Amazon Photos app. However, when I asked Google to show my pictures of dogs, it successfully opened and searched within my own Photos album for my images of dogs. 

I conducted several tests with varying styles of questions and followed up on them, which led me to a solid conclusion. If you're wondering which assistant came out on top, the most significant takeaway from all this testing is that Alexa is clearly the weakest, lagging far behind the others as a smartphone assistant. This holds especially true unless you're already deeply embedded in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem, where everything might work seamlessly in your smart home.

In fact, this debate touches on ecosystem integration, as the effectiveness of these assistants often hinges on how well they fit within their respective smart home environments. For example, if you’re committed to HomeKit, Siri becomes your go-to for managing cameras and doorbells while controlling lights. On the other hand, those deeply invested in Google Home have the same experience with Google Assistant.

The upcoming Next Gen Matter standard may change this dynamic, potentially making this section irrelevant. If you're interested in a video specifically about that, be sure to comment or leave a thumbs up. For now, considering the isolated ecosystems, they matter greatly.

Based on my experiences, across every smartphone, whether it's an iPhone or Android, Google Assistant remains the most useful overall. This advantage is amplified if you have a Pixel phone, which offers features like call screening and Hold for Me.

In general, Google Assistant is faster, provides well-sourced answers, and excels at conversational context. It also supports many third-party integrations and apps. I built my smart home around Google Home, making it exceptionally effective for me.

As for the second-best, I considered placing Bixby here—relevant primarily for Samsung phone users—but I ultimately decided on Siri due to its integration with Apple’s ecosystem. It works well if you’re involved with HomeKit and has support for smart speakers, though still lacking the capability for multiple timers on phones. Siri also supports routines, which can combine several commands into one action, but navigating the Siri shortcuts interface can be complex.

This puts Bixby in third place, while Alexa is simply ineffective on smartphones. A few years ago, an HTC phone featured both Google Assistant and Alexa side by side, and it worked reasonably well, but since then, Alexa has fallen far behind. If you are new to using voice assistants or setting up a smart home, I recommend avoiding Alexa-exclusive products for now.

Let me know in the comments if you agree that Google Assistant still stands out as the leader, or if there are any specific features you find especially useful in a virtual assistant. 

Lastly, a word from our channel sponsor, Dbrand: they are relaunching the Damascus skin due to popular demand. It features a reflective holographic design, and you can customize it for any device. Plus, you get a free Triple Black skin with your order! I’ll link it below.

Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you guys in the next one. Peace!
