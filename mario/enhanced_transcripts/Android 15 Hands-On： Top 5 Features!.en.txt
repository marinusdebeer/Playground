- Hey, what's up, MKBHD here. I've got the latest beta of Android 15 on my Pixel 8 Pro right here. As many of you know, I've been doing these videos for a long time. I’ve made videos on the best features of the latest version of Android for I don't know how many years now, even back when they were naming them after desserts. If you’ve been watching all of these, you may have noticed a trend. In the past, there used to be huge new features, massive visual overhauls, and all sorts of dramatic changes with Android. But now things have stabilized, I would say. It’s much more about small changes and nuanced improvements here and there. 

It’s reached a point where these top five features of Android 15 would have previously been part of a .0.2 update. The new features feel smaller with each new version. However, that also means they are a bit more refined; they focus more on usefulness and little tweaks that enhance the overall experience of using and owning your phone. I can appreciate that. 

I will also note that in videos past, I've mentioned versions that were initially exclusive to the Pixel line, implying that you may never get to experience the latest Android updates. But I feel like with many new companies promising a good amount of future software updates, hopefully, more people will actually see some of these improvements.

So, I'm going to jump right in. Here are the top five best features I’ve found in Android 15. 

Number five is called Private Space, and it's exactly what it sounds like. It’s a private area on your Android phone for your top-secret files, photos, and anything else you want to keep hidden. To turn it on, go to Settings, then Security & Privacy, and you'll find Private Space near the bottom. After confirming your identity, you can choose a Google account and set a new lock if you want. Once set up, you can always find it at the bottom of your app drawer.

If you give someone your phone to borrow, you could put it in Guest Mode for a brand-new setup for them, but Private Space is different. It’s a separate section with its own lock beneath your existing account, specifically for your confidential activities, apps, files, and photos. When you want to hide it away again, just hit Lock. You can put whatever you want in there—totally up to you.

Number four combines several little enhancements that stack up to create a more refined experience. One of these is rich widget previews. While this might not seem huge because you don't often add new widgets to your home screen, when you do, the widgets that support this feature will show you actual content before adding them. This is in real time and reflects real items on your phone. 

Currently, it’s very new, mostly found in just a couple of Google’s apps, primarily in the Clock app. It would be great to see more Google apps and third-party applications adopt this capability. For instance, I want to see my actual Notion boards before I add the widget, rather than a placeholder example. 

Another enhancement is the new back animation when navigating through settings or any layered menus; it feels smoother and nicer. Bluetooth audio sharing is another feature, allowing multiple headphones to pair to the same audio source as long as they support Bluetooth LE, which most modern headphones do. 

Additionally, there’s High Quality Mode when using your Android phone as a webcam, and Bluetooth Auto On, which automatically turns Bluetooth back on the next day if you turned it off, so you don’t have to remember to do it. These, along with a plethora of other small enhancements, show how Google pays attention to how we use our phones and continuously improves on those areas.

Now, speaking of little things, I have number three as one of those subtle improvements: the new volume sliders. Right now, when I hit Volume, it looks familiar. The Auto Live Caption button is still present on the Pixel, which is a totally underrated feature, and then your mode switcher at the top. When you hit the three dots to expand, you get a nearly full-screen overlay showing where audio is playing and all the volume levels for everything happening on your phone. 

This big overlay makes it super clear what's going on and how loud each individual component will be. 

Now we’re getting to the top. Number two is partial screen recordings. Normally, when you screen record on your phone, you expect to see everything—your home screen, every app you switch to, everything happening on your phone. But I've been testing screen recordings on the Pixel with this dev preview, and it’s now smarter about showing only specific things, if that’s what you want.

When you initiate a screen recording, you can choose between recording the entire screen or a single app. For example, if I select a single app and start recording, it allows me to pick which app to record. Let’s say I choose Relay for Reddit. After the countdown, it records only this app, and I can scroll around and use it as usual. If I switch to another app, like Photos, that doesn’t appear in the screen recording; it continues to capture only the Reddit app.

This focused recording is incredibly useful. You can avoid showing irrelevant notifications or security codes in recordings. It’s simply about showing exactly what you want people to see. 

Finally, number one: better notifications and notification management. Android has excelled in this area for years, and with these two previews, it’s even better, specifically in a few ways. There’s Adaptive Vibration, Notification Cool Down, and custom vibrations, among other features.

Adaptive Vibration is intriguing. It uses the phone's microphone and sensors to assess the sound levels in the environment, adjusting the vibration strength accordingly. If your phone is on a hard surface, it may vibrate at a lower intensity, while it may vibrate more firmly on a soft surface like a couch, ensuring you still hear it. 

Another feature, Notification Cool Down, is aimed at managing notifications from the same app that come in rapidly. Many of us have experienced a group chat or Slack channel that won't stop buzzing, and enabling this feature helps limit those repeating notifications while still keeping you updated.

Now, while this was present in Dev Preview 1, it appears to be missing in Dev Preview 2. I hope they bring it back—it’s a great feature. 

There’s also the subtle option of individual vibration patterns per app. Historically, smartphones had LED notification lights that would blink in different colors according to the app sending the notification. Now, developers can customize vibration patterns for their apps, and I’m hopeful that this feature will also be made available to users. I’d love to know when I get a Twitter notification without having to check my phone each time. 

As for the versioning, it doesn’t say Android 15 in Settings; it currently lists Vanilla Ice Cream for Dev Preview 2. When you click into it, you see an animated Easter egg that looks somewhat space-like. If you hold it down long enough, it speeds up and transforms into a sort of random spacecraft exploring an expansive cosmic scene. 

That said, there are some subtle changes, new notification features, and enhanced management aspects. It’s all nuanced and refined. I’m still looking forward to major AI-based features because that’ll be the stuff that makes a significant difference in how we use our phones. For now, it’s good to see solid OS features. 

Let me know your favorite feature or if you agree with my ranking of the top five in the comments below. Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace.
