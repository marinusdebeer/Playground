- One of the best gaming phones on the planet is going mainstream. Just look at all the previous ROG Phones: ROG Phone 1, ROG Phone 2, ROG Phone 3... They skipped 4 because it’s considered bad luck. Then we had ROG Phone 5, ROG Phone 6, and ROG Phone 7. Now we have the ROG Phone 8 Pro, which is noticeably more regular.

ASUS still makes other standard phones, like the Zenfone, and ROG still stands for Republic of Gamers. This is definitely still a gaming phone. However, the features that make gaming phones excellent for gaming also enhance their performance for media and make them great all-around daily drivers.

ASUS has finally said, "What if we just package our great gaming phone for the masses?" I believe this is the first time they’ve really committed to that idea. 

Don't get me wrong; they still include the gamer features. There's a hidden display on the back of the phone and all kinds of impressive specs, but the pivot is real. 

Given that it’s still a gaming phone, it's no surprise that it boasts top-tier specifications. The ROG Phone 8 Pro features a 6.78-inch 165 Hz AMOLED display with an astonishing brightness of 2,500 nits. It’s powered by a 3.3 GHz Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, with up to 24 GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1 TB of UFS 4.0 fast storage. It shatters Geekbench scores and crushes 3DMark benchmarks, and it can run "Genshin Impact" at 60 FPS. This phone is incredibly fast.

Navigating through apps and using it as a regular phone is just as impressive. It's one of the snappiest phones I’ve ever used. Taking photos is extremely quick, responding within milliseconds when you touch the shutter button. Even the optical fingerprint reader under the glass is surprisingly fast. Overall, it’s the fastest, most reactive phone I’ve ever used.

While it excels in gaming, ASUS must now repackage this as a great daily driver. Let’s face it, previous gaming phones felt overly gamery. 

First things first: it needs to be more user-friendly for one-handed use. Gamers may often hold their phones sideways, but regular phone tasks are performed vertically with one hand. So, they’ve minimized the bezels all around, which is noticeable, especially at the top and bottom. The design now aligns with other full-screen flagships on the market. 

For the first time in an ROG Phone, there’s a hole-punch camera, and it's quite small, giving it a normal look. This change comes at the expense of some front-facing speaker space. Although the speakers remain loud and capable of providing a rich stereo sound, they are slightly less powerful than those of last year.

ASUS has also made the phone thinner. They’ve flattened the frame on the sides, creating a slightly more streamlined device, now under 9 millimeters for the first time. Despite the camera bump, it’s still well-balanced.

Of course, a thinner design comes with a minor trade-off: the battery size has decreased from 6,000 mAh to 5,500 mAh in this ROG Phone. However, I haven’t really noticed a difference in usage, as it still performs remarkably well with the software optimizations and this display. 

The result of all that design trimming is a phone that is still sizable but much closer to a normal phone dimensions. It's basically the same size as my Pixel 8 Pro, which I've been using daily, yet it still includes the gaming and media-friendly features you’d expect. 

There’s still a second USB-C port on the side for charging while gaming in landscape mode, and it retains the remappable shoulder triggers and the rare headphone jack. On a side note, I’ve been testing some in-ear monitors lately, and this is one of the few phones that I can plug into and use them.

ASUS includes a surprising number of audio adjustment features along with various EQ settings that make a significant difference. Additionally, if you’re using this daily, people will want reassurance of water resistance. Previous gaming phones didn’t focus much on this aspect. While the ROG Phone 7 had an IP54 rating, which is good, this is the first ROG Phone that achieves full IP68 water and dust resistance—meaning it can withstand being rained on, accidentally having a drink spilled on it, or even being dropped in a toilet.

Now, does it still look like a gaming phone? Honestly, I believe they’ve struck a good balance. Over the years, they’ve gradually toned down the appearance, reducing the RGB lighting and jagged lines on the back. I think the camera bump is the oddest feature, but aside from that, the design is fairly subtle. It features a satin black finish that doesn’t show fingerprints, with a single glossy diagonal strip that suggests a “gamer” aesthetic, but in a subdued manner.

I could do without the text—like the “Republic of Gamers” branding or the “Good luck, have fun” message next to the USB-C port—but overall, it’s a nice, toned-down design. 

But what if I told you there’s still a display on the back? They couldn’t resist! When the screen is off, it’s nearly invisible. If you open the Armoury Crate and enable AniMe Vision—and I'm not sure why it's called that—the display lights up. It’s an all-white LED dot matrix display that can showcase everything from logos to charging status to incoming call notifications.

Even while taking a photo, it performs a countdown timer on the outside screen. When gaming, it can show that you’re playing a game. While this feature is somewhat gimmicky, I appreciate it for a couple of reasons: it remains minimal on the back of the phone and provides useful information. You can customize it for different scenarios, and when the screen is off, you wouldn't even notice it was there.

Furthermore, they've included wireless charging in an ROG Phone for the first time. Previous models had so much going on with screens and lights on the back that there was no room for wireless charging, which was acceptable as gamers weren’t initially interested. However, they’ve now made space for it.

I should mention that the coil is positioned slightly higher than normal, above the display. As a result, it doesn’t align with vertical wireless chargers, but if you place the phone sideways, it charges without issue. Many people don't rely on wireless charging, but it appears to be a necessary feature for high-end versatile flagship phones.

Even if you don’t use that feature, there’s still 65-watt wired charging with the charger included in the box. 

In previous reviews, I would often say, "The camera is pretty bad, but this is a gaming phone. That's not why you’re buying it." With the ROG Phone 8 Pro, the camera has transitioned from an afterthought to one of the most important aspects of a mainstream phone.

So how did ASUS fare in this department? The ROG Phone features an all-new camera system with a 50-megapixel primary camera, a 3x telephoto for the first time, and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide. While it's more capable than before, it seems to lag behind the Zenfone 10, which is also made by ASUS. Are the different branches of the company even communicating? (laughs)

The primary camera sensor is the IMX890, similar to the one in the OnePlus 11, the Nothing Phone 2, and others in the $600-$700 range. It produces decent images in good lighting but tends to suffer from motion blur and aggressive HDR adjustments. With subjects like people, the faces sometimes look overexposed while the background gets underexposed. It’s evident that the processing is quite aggressive, almost as if it’s using algorithms meant for older sensors.

On the upside, it offers super steady video thanks to a hybrid six-axis gimbal, which enhances handheld shooting in lower light conditions and results in smooth video capture. The front-facing camera is wider angle, allowing more people to fit into the frame, even if it still leans towards HDR over-processing.

The telephoto lens, new in this model, provides genuine utility. For those who do a lot of zooming, 3x may not be the most extensive zoom available, but the stabilization is solid, allowing for effective digital zooming.

In summary, the camera has advanced but remains a secondary focus for this phone. While it could meet the needs of a $600-$700 phone, it’s worth noting that the ROG Phone starts at $1,100 and this Pro version, with 24 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage, is priced at $1,500.

This year, you’ll start noticing AI features in nearly every phone powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. This is one of the first devices showcasing these capabilities. Qualcomm has integrated new AI functionalities into this chip, and manufacturers are likely to utilize them extensively.

For the ROG Phone, these features include pattern recognition in games that fast-tracks through recognized scenes in supported titles, as well as the ability to identify on-screen elements and direct you to relevant walkthroughs for the game you’re playing. 

I’ve found other features, like the improved setting search, to be quite practical. The system has semantic understanding, enabling it to locate settings based on descriptions you provide. Even if you type something like “Two of one,” it recognizes that you’re referring to the Twin Apps feature that allows multiple accounts for a single app.

Overall, AI capabilities will be a significant theme for phones in 2024, and you can take my word for it.

To wrap up, the ROG Phone 8 Pro remains a powerful, fast Android phone, but it features a refined aesthetic that sacrifices some gamery elements for broader appeal. Many of the design decisions seem intelligent, like implementing thinner bezels and a more streamlined form factor, even with a slightly smaller battery.

However, ASUS couldn’t overcome the challenges of the camera system. While it's good, it falls short of expectations for a mainstream phone, which remains a crucial aspect. Thus, this phone excels as a solid gaming device.

Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.
