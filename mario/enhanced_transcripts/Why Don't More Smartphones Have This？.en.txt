Okay, so this is the TCL 40 NXTPAPER, and at first glance, it might not appear to be a particularly special phone. This is a $200 budget Android phone with a 5000 mAh battery, a standard 50-megapixel main camera flanked by a 5-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel macro lens. Inside, you’ll find a MediaTek G88 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and 256 GB of storage. 

The design is quite basic; it has a squared-off shape with a solid blue color and some sparkles. However, it has one really interesting feature that has caught my attention, and that’s the screen. The TCL 40 NXTPAPER boasts a 6.78-inch, flat, 1080p, 90 Hz display. But when you compare it to another phone, you immediately notice something very different about it: there are no reflections at all—well, almost none. 

It’s called the NXTPAPER because TCL refers to it as a full-color electronic paper display that delivers a reflection-free, full-color, paper-like visual experience. This design looks much better, reduces eye fatigue, and feels more comfortable to hold. My first thought when I saw this was, why doesn’t every phone have this? How is it that a super cheap budget phone is the first one I’ve seen pull this off, and why aren’t more phones doing it? What am I missing?

TCL calls it the NXTPAPER because they want you to think of it as similar to an e-paper display. If you’ve ever seen a Kindle or any of the various E Ink displays out there, you know that technology is quite impressive. It minimizes eye fatigue and creates the sensation of something being literally printed on a piece of paper right in front of you. It works beautifully in various lighting conditions because it rearranges actual ink underneath the display.

However, the NXTPAPER is not exactly that. It’s essentially an LCD display with a textured glass surface and some software tricks to mimic a paper-like display while delivering nearly all the eye comfort benefits that come with e-paper displays. The result is a screen that looks like a normal smartphone display but has zero reflections, which I find highly appealing. 

When I review phones, I usually spend a lot of time trying to shield these displays from reflections—this is a lesser-known fact. Shooting reflective surfaces can be quite the challenge; I often have to angle the phone and shoot in specific environments, sometimes using a flag to block reflections and make the screen easier to see. With this matte display, I don’t need any of that special treatment. It’s clear at any angle, and the angles that would normally cause a giant reflection simply appear lighter and a little faded but are still readable. 

When you look straight on, the display is soft and less stressful on the eyes. It kind of has a paper-like quality, reminiscent of those paper-like displays. Most of this is possible thanks to the hardware; there are several extra layers between the actual LCD panel and the user, including this textured glass, which contributes to its anti-reflective characteristics. 

There are additional benefits as well, such as physically limiting the amount of blue light that passes through. Instead of using a software blue light filter, there’s simply less blue light reaching your eyes due to an additional physical filter. Another understated feature is the feel of the glass; it has a soft-touch effect thanks to its slight texture. You can even see the difference at the cutout for the front-facing camera—textured glass over that area would compromise photo quality, but it’s a clear spot to observe the distinction between the matte finish and glossy glass.

I think all of this makes for a compelling device: the matte finish, nearly zero reflections, reduced eye strain, and the soft-touch surface. There’s even stylus support; TCL produces a stylus that works with this screen. But what’s the catch? Why don’t more phones feature this technology? 

Well, as you might suspect, there are some downsides. The extra layers on the display have their drawbacks, primarily cutting down the amount of light that gets through, which diminishes both sharpness and overall brightness. The maximum brightness of this screen is 450 nits. It’s sufficient for reading indoors, but outdoors, it can quickly become washed out and disappointingly dim. 

Likewise, while this is a 1080p display, it doesn’t really look like it. If I were to ask you what resolution you think this display is, it might compare closer to 720p. Text is softer, edges appear blurred, and all the corners lack definition. While this makes the display easy on the eyes—nothing feels harsh or overly bright—if you're looking for sharp photos or video details, the layers between your eyes and the display hinder clarity.

The limited brightness also affects contrast, with a rated contrast ratio of just 1500:1, which isn’t great even compared to other budget phones. Additionally, most people use screen protectors, but applying one to a matte display like this wouldn’t make sense. 

In a world of feature-rich smartphones with big, bright, clear displays, this technology shifts from being an advantage to a niche feature. Most consumers are not willing to sacrifice the drawbacks of slightly reduced eye strain and reflections for a matte display. Unlike desktop screens, where consumers heavily prioritize display properties, a phone has a variety of aspects that matter to users, and this trade-off doesn’t sit well with them.

I’ve discussed other niche features in the smartphone market that are excellent but won’t necessarily sell a lot of devices, and this fits perfectly into that category. TCL even includes special NXTPAPER modes in the software. One mode called “color paper” reduces saturation and creates a textured look, making the screen appear like a colored piece of paper with icons in colored ink moving around. There’s even an “ink paper” mode that turns the display black and white.

It seems silly at first, but if you compare it to an actual E Ink display, this technology shines. An e-reader is the least fatiguing option for your eyes, but they often lack seamless animations, like a realistic page-turn. A smartphone with this specialized hardware layer can come close to that visual level while offering 90 Hz responsiveness, full color, and all the functionality of a phone on top of being an e-reader, which is incredibly innovative. TCL even produces a tablet with this technology and another phone in the same vein.

It's a cool idea, but almost no one is going to buy it, and that explains why not every phone manufacturer is pursuing this technology for now. 

Thanks for watching! Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.
