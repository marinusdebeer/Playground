- All right, so I've been using the new M4 iPad Pro for about two weeks now. I've been doing a lot of the same things I did with my M1 iPad Pro from three years ago: watching YouTube videos, browsing the internet, answering emails, and listening to music. Spoiler alert: it’s almost exactly the same experience. The M1 iPad Pro was already super powerful, smooth, and snappy, with great battery life. This one is even better in all the same areas. Not the most helpful review, I know, but I've also been thinking about some of the interesting decisions Apple made with this iPad, particularly things that weren’t really in the rumor mill and didn’t even show up in the keynote but are unusual and different. 

So, here are five of the most interesting choices Apple made with the iPad Pro.  

First of all, the new iPad Pro is thinner. We all knew that. It was an interesting choice since I felt like we were done with that a few iterations ago. Nobody was really asking for thinner iPads, but maybe they noticed all the praise for Samsung's Galaxy Tab Ultra, which is also ridiculously thin. The previous iPad was 6.4 mm—slightly thicker than Samsung’s flagship—and now it’s down to 5.1 mm, just barely beating Samsung’s number. I’m not trying to start any unnecessary competition here; if you ask Apple, they’d probably say, "Look, it’s the thinnest Apple product ever," which is already impressive. It really feels like Apple is just looking for something to differentiate this model from the last couple of generations of iPads.

Now there are rumors they may also be pursuing thinness with next year’s iPhone. Honestly, it feels noticeably thinner and lighter to me, especially as someone who has held the previous one quite a bit. There’s definitely less of a difference with a case on it, but this design naturally means there’s less room inside. Interestingly, the 11" iPad Pro M4 has a larger battery than the last-generation 11" iPad Pro, while the new, larger 13" has a slightly smaller battery—almost the same size as last year’s. So, you end up with really good battery life again, excellent standby time, and solid performance when you’re using it. Apple could have created an iPad with an enormous battery life if they kept the thickness the same as last year, utilizing the efficiency of the M4 chip for insane battery longevity. Instead, they made it strikingly thin while maintaining the same reliable battery life as always. Personally, I would have preferred option one. 

There are a few other things missing from this tablet as well. They avoided mentioning it during the keynote, but they got rid of the ultra-wide camera. It’s not a huge deal—obviously. The camera square looks like it could support multiple cameras due to the big cutout for the LiDAR, but it’s just a single camera, LiDAR, and a flash. I was curious if magnet paper could reveal anything new about the iPad. Before JerryRigEverything tore it apart, I thought that if you make something thinner and smaller, the speakers would suffer, right? They would have to be smaller. Magnet paper is a fun way to see both the magnets inside and that the iPad Pro has new, more circular quad speaker drivers, as opposed to the more rectangular-looking ones from before. 

I’ve listened to both versions back to back, and this one is a little less bass-heavy, but it remains loud and features some of the best speakers in any tablet. It’s very usable, but with less internal room, the physics result in a slightly less bass-heavy output from the new speakers.

Now, in terms of packaging, not much has changed. I mean, an iPad box is still just an iPad box, but there are two notable points: one, no more stickers. Sorry, Apple fans, if you were hoping to keep collecting those. They’re focusing on environmental issues, cutting back on plastic, and trying to avoid shipping excess materials. But they still include a few things with every iPad. If you get a Space Grey iPad, you’ll receive a black USB-C cable, as well as a 20-watt charging brick. Okay, fine, but it’s this white charging brick. I know they stopped including the brick with iPhones and could have done the same with the iPad, but they chose to keep shipping a brick. And with a $1,500, $2,000, or even $2,500 iPad, could it at least be a decent brick that supports the fastest charging the iPad can handle? Perhaps even match the color of the cable? But maybe that’s just nitpicking—it probably is.

Let’s talk about this computer aspect. The criticism aimed at the iPad Pro over the years has been that it’s a ridiculously overpowered device, but it’s still just an iPad. It effectively does the same things as an iPad Air. Sure, there are a few added features, like Pencil hover, but overall, it remains fundamentally the same. Apple isn’t letting the iPad Pro become a full-fledged computer because it has Macs to protect. So, it remains an overpowered iPad. 

This generation continues that trend. While it’s true that Apple is unveiling the new M4 chip here first, it’s even more powerful at its peak. It benchmarks extremely well, utilizing a second-generation 3-nanometer process, and has a larger, more powerful neural engine. This chip is fantastic, but as for software that actually takes advantage of that power, the list is very short. Some of the features, like the new Final Cut app, are set to arrive later this year.

If you’re doing standard iPad activities—watching Netflix, web browsing, all the classics—you’ll feel exactly the same experience, not just compared to the last M1 iPad Pro, but also to an M1 iPad Air. With the M4 version, you can play one of the few games that support the new hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and you can use the new Stem Splitter feature in the Logic Pro 2 app for iPad, which looks fantastic for Logic users. However, the most intriguing new feature about the M4, something they didn’t elaborate on, is how Apple has restructured its pricing model.

In the past, when buying an iPad, the only upgrade was mainly storage, starting at a somewhat inadequate 128 GB, then increasing in price for larger storage variants. A few years ago, we realized that purchasing more storage also meant getting more RAM—but now this latest model escalates that stratification further. Now, you not only get storage but also a different number of CPU cores. The base iPad Pro is now 256 GB, and there’s a transition from an 8-core to a 9-core CPU with the M4 chip, but only in the base models. The top two versions come with an extra performance core, giving those models 10-core CPUs. Additionally, there’s a nano-texture display available only on the high-end options, which I briefly tested at the event. Although I have durability concerns, the anti-reflective finish is impressive. 

Now, if you’re purchasing a more expensive iPad Pro, you’re getting varying amounts of RAM, CPU cores, storage options, and display types—very computer-like, if you ask me. To me, though, the Tandem OLED display is the most exciting new development for the iPad Pro. In practice, it’s just a brighter, more contrasted version of the display we’ve had for years. Unfortunately, even with an updated OLED display, you won’t notice much difference while watching regular SDR content or doing standard tasks unless you are in direct sunlight at maximum brightness. This speaks to how good the iPad Pro displays have been for years.

For artists, there’s also the new Pencil. No, the back still doesn’t act as an eraser, which I wish they would implement, but the rest of the Pencil is better than ever. It now supports Find My, has a new squeeze sensor for selecting tools, and includes a haptic motor for a little click when you squeeze, offering nice confirmation. Surprisingly, they didn’t add this feature sooner. Additionally, the Pencil supports barrel rotation, providing some tools that change with rotation. Furthermore, there’s a fake shadow displayed that follows the tool you’re using in real-time, depending on rotation—quite the extravagant feature. 

Instead of just naming it the updated Apple Pencil, they continue to sell the old version at the same price and are now calling the new one the Pencil Pro. I’m not an artist and am outside the target demographic for this product, but if these new features appeal to you, you’ll need to buy a new iPad to enjoy them.

That decision was intentional, as they moved the camera to the landscape side of the iPad, which is a great choice. That’s where we always wanted it, and it houses the Face ID components. There’s also an ultra-wide camera for FaceTime, but that’s also where the Pencil has always magnetized and charged. They had to rearrange the internal components to accommodate both. The Pencil still snaps onto the top, but I wonder if it was necessary to arrange them this way. Couldn’t they have placed the Pencil on the iPad’s top or maybe offset it so that the Pencil is on one side and the camera on the other? Instead, they have it in the middle, as always. I used magnet paper to check the back, which confirmed that they changed the magnet layout inside. I tried pairing the new Pencil Pro with my old iPad Pro, and while it stuck a bit, it didn’t fully connect. Convenient, right? 

Honestly, I’m not personally interested in buying one of the new M4 iPad Pros because I already have a relatively new M1 iPad, so I don’t need an upgrade. However, if you don’t have a recent iPad, this new version is fantastic and better than ever. But we’re surely all waiting for WWDC later this year to see what new features iPadOS will offer that this new model can support—anything truly interesting that we don’t already know about. Beyond that, it’s somewhat of the same story as the last few generations of the iPad Pro.

Speaking of thinness, though, have you checked out dbrand iPad skins? Fun fact: you’d need to stack up 22 of dbrand’s iPad skins to match the thickness of the iPad itself. Trust me, I’ve tried—it’s exactly 22. Anyway, dbrand has been creating the best leather skins in the business for a while now, which is great since Apple isn’t really producing anything leather anymore. Their skins are high-quality soft leather, not some sanded-down fake texture. It’s all-natural, full-grain leather that feels plush and will develop a nice patina over time since you can have these iPads for years. If you want to check out premium leather accessories for your iPad, look at our channel sponsor, dbrand. The link is in the description.

Either way, that’s it for now. Let me know what you think. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.
