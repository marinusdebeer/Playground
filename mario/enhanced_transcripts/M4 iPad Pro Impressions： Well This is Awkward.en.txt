Okay, so Apple had a nice, short 30-minute event today announcing a bunch of new iPad stuff. This was the longest they’ve ever gone without updating anything iPad-related, so they had some cooking to do. But the thing is, and I feel like we’ve been saying this for years, it kind of doesn’t matter how powerful they make the iPad. It’s still just an iPad, right? It’s still iPadOS. We’ve seen gigantic improvements in the M-series chips, and these iPads have some of the most powerful chips ever on paper, but they’re still iPads. So the last thing we need after all this time is just another spec-bumped iPad, right?

Well, let me introduce you to the newest iPads. First up, there’s a new iPad Air that follows the script of bringing a few things down from the previous iPad Pros while also offering it at a lower price. It upgrades from the M1 to the M2 chip inside, starts with 128 GB of storage now, and moves the webcam to the landscape bezel where it belongs. It gets faster Wi-Fi, and for the first time, there’s a larger version, so they’re calling it the 11-inch and the 13-inch iPad Air. I had to clarify this because the last one was 10.9 inches; are they just simplifying the name? Well, it turns out there is a little bit more screen here. Great! But other than that, it’s pretty predictable. It’s a spec bump—sticking to the script. I think I could hand you the newest iPad right now, and you couldn’t really tell the new Air from the old Air just by looking at it, unless you’re holding the bigger one or if you recognized the super exciting new colors. 

I mean, hopefully, you could hear my sarcasm through the screen, but there’s Blue, Purple, Starlight, and Space Gray. It’s $599 for the small one and $799 for the bigger one. But then we also got a more significant update to the iPad Pros. This is where they push the limits of the iPad, showing their best stuff and the best possible tablets. Man, if we just ignore the software for a second, these new iPads are ridiculous. 

First of all, they revealed that these new iPads, the 11-inch and the 13-inch, are the new thinnest Apple devices ever made. That includes phones, old iPods, and everything. The 11-inch is 5.3 millimeters thin, and the 13-inch is 5.1 millimeters thin; that’s literally thinner than the iPod Nano ever was. It’s nuts. It looks ridiculous and feels crazy to hold. I don’t know if anyone ever looked at an iPad Pro and asked for it to be thinner, but that’s what they went and did. What could possibly go wrong? Fun fact: this also means the iPad Air is now heavier than the iPad Pro, just to keep the iPad lineup interesting.

The new Pro also gets a new chip and a new screen. Apple introduced us to the next generation of Apple silicon with the M4 chip, and this iPad is the only device it’s in right now. It provides even more power in a tiny physical and thermal envelope, especially since we’re coming from the M2. It’s a more power-efficient 3-nanometer chip. The CPU core is now 50% faster than the M2, and the GPU is up to four times faster. They claim it can deliver the same performance as the M2 with half the power, so it’s super efficient. There’s an improved neural engine and better cooling. 

Again, while I don’t know who was asking for a thinner iPad, it’s at least visually impressive. This is the type of form factor that’s specifically enabled by the M4 chip. Apple is quoting basically the same battery life as the last iPad Pro, and I have to assume there’s significantly less physical battery in the device because it’s so much thinner. So that likely means Apple thinks that the battery life in the last generation was sufficient, so they’re just matching it, allowing for a thinner design with less battery because the new chip is more efficient.

Then we have the new display, another feature enabled by the M4 chip. Both sizes now have OLED screens, and the specs are identical which makes the $300 price difference a bit tougher to justify. But yes, there are now OLEDs in both new iPad Pros. We’ve known the benefits of OLEDs for years: pitch-black blacks, individually lit pixels, and vibrant colors. We were excited to finally see this in a relatively large iPad display, but making a huge OLED that’s also incredibly bright required a bit of engineering ingenuity. 

They developed something they’re calling a tandem OLED display, which essentially consists of two different OLED displays stacked on top of each other. The new display driver on the M4 chip can address both layers simultaneously, allowing for high local brightness. The specs are now 1000 nits of peak full-screen brightness and 1600 nits of peak HDR brightness on an OLED iPad-sized screen. In person, it looks like a really bright OLED—super colorful with deep blacks. I spent about 30 minutes at a hands-on area, and while the lighting wasn’t ideal, I’ll be reviewing it soon to see if there are any downsides. Overall, it looks pretty great so far.

Interestingly, they also announced a Nano texture matte version of the iPad Pro. Now there’s a matte Pro Display XDR. I would be careful about ordering this particular option based on what I’ve seen. It definitely deals better with reflections than a normal display, but like the desktop version, this comes at the expense of some sharpness and contrast. The blacks, for instance, don’t look quite as black, even at optimal angles. I also have to wonder about its durability because the Pro Display XDR is very specific about which microfiber cloth you use—you can literally ruin it with the wrong one. With this iPad, I can feel the difference between the soft-touch texture of the Nano texture and the glossy bezels, and I suspect you’ll only be able to rely on the microfiber that comes in the box. Also, it costs an extra $100 to get the Nano texture, and it’s only available on the 1 terabyte and 2 terabyte highest-end models. So they seem to know people shouldn’t just walk in and grab it off the base model.

What probably made the most headlines from today’s announcements is a spec-bumped Apple Pencil. There’s a new Apple Pencil Pro, which looks exactly like the previous version but now has "Pencil Pro" engraved on the back. Unfortunately, it’s still not an eraser. This new Apple Pencil Pro has a haptic motor inside, supports Find My, has a new squeeze sensor for activating tools in various apps that support it, and a new gyroscope that makes it rotation-sensitive. I tried it out, and it’s surprisingly precise. So if you’re an artist, this might be perfect for you, especially for the $129 price tag.

However, a frustrating note: this new Pro Pencil is only compatible with the newly announced iPad Pro or iPad Air. When Apple moved the webcam to the long side, that changed where a lot of the magnets for lining up and charging the pencil were located. So they had to redesign the magnets, creating a new array that’s only compatible with the newest iPads. Why didn’t they just move it to the other side for charging? I don’t know; that seems like it would have made too much sense.

There’s also a new Magic Keyboard, which is still incredibly expensive, but it’s lighter than the previous generation, has a bigger trackpad, and includes a function row at the top, which is super useful. Plus, the passthrough charging is now faster at 60 watts through the pins in the back.

At the end of the day, guess what? We just got another set of spec-bumped iPads. They are metal rectangles with incredible power and efficiency in our hands, but they’re still just iPads. Honestly, I don’t know how many more times I can say this: taking advantage of all this power is nearly impossible. There’s a tiny fraction of apps that actually make it worth upgrading. Almost nothing these iPads can do that my M1 iPad Pro can’t.

This isn’t to downplay the hardware because it’s actually amazing. It has a super bright, high-resolution OLED display with deep blacks, the M4 chip with ridiculous power and efficiency, a new CPU, a new GPU, and a better neural engine. I’ve never wanted an iPad to be thinner, but that line about making the iPad feel like a magic sheet of glass really resonated with this model, even if you feel like you could snap it in half the whole time. 

The awkwardness of this launch mostly comes from timing. WWDC, their Worldwide Developers Conference, is right around the corner, and we expect them to update all their software. iOS, iPadOS—whatever Apple decides to do with that—should be coming soon. So we have these new iPads shipping next week, but all the new software could be fantastic and is expected this summer. This feels like it could be one of the biggest updates yet for these iPads, showing how many more AI features Apple wants to integrate and how they want to enable these devices to serve as primary computers, possibly with more Siri improvements and more. 

So here we have these impressive spec-bumped iPad Pros, the most powerful iPads of all time and the thinnest Apple devices ever made, yet the list of things they can do is pretty much the same as my three-year-old M1. What a time to be alive.

Speaking of announcements, Ridge and I have finally launched our first product together. We’re starting with the Ridge Wallet—you know, the minimal, high-quality industrial wallet, the modern way to carry cash and cards. I joined Ridge as the Chief Creative Partner earlier this year, and we’re finally releasing our first MKBHD gear together. One of the first things we wanted to do was make MKBHD versions of some existing products, which felt too obvious. 

So I love carbon fiber and matte black; I don’t know if you knew that about me already, but those were my base inspirations for these two wallets. The MKBHD Carbon Fiber 3k is made of lightweight, ultra-durable carbon fiber with the logo. The Matte Black Everything Wallet is aluminum with a black oil-filled engraving print, which is so cool. These wallets also come with a debossed MKBHD money clip or a cash strap. You can attach or detach them. You can also attach an AirTag or use a Find My card, which I do, so I never lose it. 

And if you don’t like my designs, that’s fine! Ridge has over 50 other designs in their catalog, including NFL licensed team options if you want to support your favorite team. The store is endless, and if you think it might be time for an upgrade, it’s a great time to try because if you don’t love it after 99 days, you can send it back, no questions asked. That’s pretty sick.

I’ll let you in on a little secret: it’s 30% off the new gear right now, and if you order a wallet and a key holder at the same time, you get 30% off both. Plus, you can get 10% off anything at ridge.com/mkbhd. You’re welcome.

I’m excited to launch this stuff and have more coming up later this year. I won’t say too much about that, but you can sign up at the same link for product updates. I’ve told them to only email about that if you sign up.

Let me know what you think about these new iPads in general. It’s kind of an awkward waiting period until we get all the new iOS 18 features, but what are your thoughts on the new thinner-than-ever iPads? Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you guys in the next one. Peace!
