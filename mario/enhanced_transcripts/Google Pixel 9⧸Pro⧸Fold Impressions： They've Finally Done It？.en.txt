I think Google might have done it this time. The only reason I hesitate is that I've had this exact same feeling and said this same line before about the Pixel 6. Google’s phones have always been focused on software, and we've just wanted them to improve their hardware to have a truly competitive phone. But I think they’ve done it.

Today, Google had their Pixel 9 event, and there’s more than just the new Pixel phones on display. They also introduced a new watch and new Pixel Buds, which I'll touch on later, but I want to focus this video on the new phones because I’ve been waiting for these for a while.

There are several models: the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Some people find the names a bit confusing; honestly, it's not that bad, maybe except for the Fold. The base model, the Pixel 9, starts at $799 and features a 6.3-inch screen size. It has a new design with flat matte metal sides and a polished glass back available in four colors: Porcelain (white), Obsidian (black), Wintergreen, and Peony—definitely reminiscent of Cosmo and Wanda vibes.

Then we have the two Pro models: the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL. What’s impressive is that the Pixel 9 Pro is the same size as the Pixel 9, similar to what Apple has been doing with the iPhone. The only difference with the XL version is that it has a larger 6.8-inch screen and a bigger battery. The Pro models start at $999 and $1,099, and they come with an additional telephoto camera, more RAM, and glossy rails with a soft-touch glass back. They are available in Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel, and Rose Quartz, which is a nice muted pink.

I had the chance to handle these phones for about two hours, and from the very beginning, I thought, “Wow, yes, Google has done it. These phones genuinely feel and look like actual flagships.” It’s not just the trend toward flat sides that I like; these phones feel a bit heavier in the hand now, providing a more solid feel. The screens are all significantly brighter too. The Pixel 9's Actua display is 35% brighter than that of the Pixel 8, and the bezels are thinner all around. Plus, finally, there’s an ultrasonic fingerprint reader under the display instead of the optical one.

The camera visor on the back is polarizing. Some will love it, some won’t, but I find the large lens opening quite promising. Of course, I need to fully test all these features for a more thorough review, but my first impression is that the photos will be very Pixel-like—punchy and contrasty—thanks to the larger sensors that potentially allow for a shallower depth of field.

In terms of design, while I prefer the older camera bumps, I'm warming up to these new ones. I miss the full visor around the camera area, but the flat island design remains distinctive and unique to Pixel.

Now, let’s summarize the specs. All the new Pixels feature the same Tensor G4 chip, which is said to be more powerful and efficient, boasting improved AI capabilities. Noticeably, the primary and ultra-wide cameras remain the same between the base and Pro models. This makes the base model look like a great deal, but it does mean there’s not a lot of hardware difference between the base and Pro versions for the $200 price difference this year. For that, the Pro model provides possibly a slightly better screen, a telephoto camera, more RAM, and an enhanced selfie camera. That’s about it.

I don’t want to judge too early because I haven’t benchmarked it or tested long-term performance, but Google claims the Tensor is 20% faster for web browsing and 17% faster for app launching, and I believe them. These phones feel really quick and snappy from my initial impressions.

I’m particularly pleased that there’s now a smaller phone that packs all the benefits of the Pro model. Many people want a better phone without it being gigantic, so having a Pro version without a Pro Max option is great.

Naturally, these wouldn’t be Pixel phones without a plethora of AI features. Some exciting new updates are coming with these Pixel 9s, including a revamped Weather app, a new Screenshots app, and Pixel Studio. The Google Weather app has been redesigned with a tile format and a modern look. At the top, there’s an AI-generated comment about the weather, sometimes even suggesting what to wear. I don’t often use stock weather apps, but this is a nice addition for those who do.

The new Screenshots app is intriguing. While not everyone may find it useful, it consolidates all your screenshots in one place, scanning them for information that can remind or assist you later. 

Then there’s Pixel Studio, which lets you create AI-generated art right on your device using simple text prompts. Apple recently announced something similar in iOS 18, but it’s not out yet. The demo showed it quickly generating images—around three seconds—which is neat that it works offline too.

Additionally, Magic Editor in photos introduces a new Reimagine feature that lets you highlight a section in your pictures and reimagine it as something else entirely—a more advanced take on tools like Samsung's sketch-to-image feature.

One of the most impressive features is the new Add Me function in the camera. If you’re in a group and want to take a picture but lack someone to capture the shot, this feature guides you through the process. First, you take a shot without yourself in it, leaving space for you. Then a friend positions themselves while you pose, and the camera merges both images into a single group photo. It retains the originals too.

There are other enhancements like better Clear Calling, Call Notes that summarize phone calls, and Gemini Live for having conversations with an assistant, though that's a bit confusing.

Overall, I was most excited about the hardware of these new phones. Now, let’s talk about the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. I’m not sure why it’s not just called the Pixel Fold 2, but the naming might be easier to remember since everything else is under the 9 banner. Regardless, it’s a significant improvement over last year’s Pixel Fold, still priced at $1,799.

Google really improved the Fold model. The previous one often got dubbed the best foldable to use when closed—which is somewhat of a backhanded compliment—but this new model features a larger 6.3-inch external display and is much brighter, at 80% more than the last model.

The inside boasts an eight-inch display that mirrors the outside screen layout. The design has metal rails and soft-touch matte glass, giving it a more premium feel than ever. The thinness of the device is impressive, ensuring it’s easy to handle.

However, the camera bump is a bit disappointing. It lacks thoughtful design, but I can overlook it given the overall quality of the phone. It feels fantastic when open and nice when closed, seemingly better than the previous best foldable, the OnePlus Open.

Of course, battery life and camera quality still need testing, but my initial impression is quite positive. The Pro Fold also includes the Tensor G4 chip, 16 GB of RAM, and all the AI features introduced in the new Pixels. It’s also IPX8 rated, meaning it can withstand splashes. Google mentioned collaborating with developers to optimize games for the internal screen, which I look forward to seeing.

The phone comes in two colors: Porcelain and Obsidian. Consider me very interested; I’ve stepped away from foldables for my daily driver recently, but I think the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a chance to bring me back, especially with its massive eight-inch display.

These new phones feel like they’ve genuinely achieved the modern upgrade we've been hoping for from Google’s flagship line. The main spec I noticed missing is Qi2, which is disappointing.

As promised, it’s not just the phones on display. The new Pixel Watch 3 retains the same design but now comes in two sizes. A larger 45-millimeter version offers around 40% more screen. The bezels are smaller, and the screens are brighter, reaching up to 2,000 nits.

There’s a new body score feature that summarizes your metrics into a single score, a feature that seems to have gained traction across multiple brands. Additionally, they’ve introduced new running features. The most notable update is a dual-chip architecture designed for longer battery life, claiming up to 36 hours in Battery Saver mode. This isn’t groundbreaking, but it should improve on last year's model.

The pricing remains the same: $349 for the smaller model and $399 for the larger one. 

Lastly, let’s talk about the new Pixel Buds, now called the Pixel Buds Pro 2. The design has been updated to be smaller, featuring little bud shapes without stalks, and comes with a stabilizer fin for better fit. A new custom-designed A1 chip enhances active noise cancellation and overall sound quality.

You can also have conversations with Gemini Live directly through the Buds, making it an interesting feature. I plan to test these out as well.

Please let me know what aspects you’re most interested in for full reviews! I aim to get my hands on as many products as possible, so subscribe to see more. What excites you most—the AI features, the camera improvements, or the new hardware? Let me know in the comments below.

Years ago, I posted a poll on Twitter asking how many of you use a case on your phone, and about three-quarters said yes. Given that phones have only become more expensive, I understand the trend. If you’re considering a case for your new phone, I recommend the Grip Case from channel sponsor dbrand. It comes in matte black, is super grippy, features clicky buttons, and provides strong magnets for protection. I’ll leave a link below if you want to check it out.

That’s it for now. Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you on the next one. Peace.
