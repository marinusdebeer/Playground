All right, so this is the iPhone 15 lineup: the iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max. We have new colors, new materials, and new ports. There's some exciting stuff to unbox here, so let’s get started.

First up, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. The iPhone 15 here is in the new blue color, which I’m going to rename “barely blue.” I think that’s an appropriate name because it really only gives hints of blue. You can see it more on the side rails. Overall, the colors this year are very subtle. 

Inside the box, we find the usual paperwork, a single white Apple sticker, and no SIM card ejector tool since they have all switched to eSIM in the US now. Most importantly, the new cable included with the iPhone is a single white braided USB-C to USB-C cable. This is the first time the iPhone is shipping with a nice braided cable like this, so hopefully it’ll be more durable than the old cables we've received for years. So, cool—USB-C cable, USB-C phone.

Now, looking at the Plus model, the concept is the same: a larger box, but this time in an incredibly pale yellow. In perfect lighting at the Apple event, it looked a bit more colorful, but in regular light, it appears very washed out.

Next, we have the Pro boxes for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. They still feature white boxes but with dark wallpapers. The iPhone 15 Pro here is in a new dark blue color—again, I'd almost rename this one “barely blue” too, but this time it’s darker and has a grayish tone depending on the light. It feels very safe.

Inside the Pro box, you again have the paperwork, the white Apple sticker, and the braided USB-C cable. And our iPhone 15 Pro Max here is in the new Natural Titanium color. I have to say, I think this will be the most popular color; it really stands out when you have it in hand. I’ll explain more about why a bit later.

So, by the time you see this, I’ve been testing these phones for about six days now. That’s not quite enough time for a full review per my standards, but I do have some thoughts and observations, plus a few quirks.

First up, the pale colors. This might be fine for some, but I’ve often been told that everyone will put a case on their phone—which is probably true. However, Apple did spend a lot of time and effort developing this new softer-touch satin finish on the back, and some of us carry our phones without a case, so it’s worth mentioning.

For the Pro models, there’s an added layer of interest. Apple has switched the rail material from shiny stainless steel to brushed titanium. It’s approximately 10% lighter, which is noticeable and enjoyable. However, I thought the brushed finish would minimize fingerprints on the sides. I was wrong. It’s less bad than stainless steel but still noticeable, especially on the darker colors like black or blue.

Additionally, this material isn’t anodized as aluminum might be; it features a new PVD coating. While I’m not sure how well this will hold up over time, I do know that if you get a scratch deep enough, it'll reveal the lighter Natural Titanium color beneath, which could look unappealing if you drop the phone and get a large gash on it.

That said, I really think the Natural Titanium or the lighter colors will be the better options for the Pro models this year.

Now, some specific observations from my first week. On the Pro, the bezels are slightly thinner, which makes the body a bit smaller, but the difference isn’t very noticeable. What is noticeable is the softer curves around these phones, especially on the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro. Last year’s iPhones had very square edges, but the new models have a subtle curve into the rails, which makes them more comfortable to hold while still looking boxy.

With USB-C on these phones, we already know you can just plug in a cable to charge accessories. While there’s no reverse wireless charging, you can connect a USB-C cable to charge AirPods, an Apple Watch MagSafe charger, etc. 

I explored some of the behaviors related to plugging things into the iPhone 15s. If you connect an older Lightning iPhone to a USB-C iPhone, the USB-C iPhone will always provide battery to the Lightning iPhone, regardless of charge state. However, if you connect another USB-C iPhone, they do a handshake to determine which has a lower battery. The one with the higher charge will act as a battery bank to charge the one with the lower charge until you unplug them.

I also tested a couple of Android phones to see if a similar handshake occurred. If you plug into an Android phone with more battery that supports USB Power Delivery (PD), it will function as a battery bank. If the other phone doesn’t support USB PD, it can be inconsistent, with either phone potentially charging the other. But if it does support USB PD, it will perform the same handshake as the iPhones.

The output is limited to 4.5 watts, so it’s not fast charging but good for accessories. You can use the cable in the box to charge new AirPods or other devices, or even rescue another smartphone if needed.

Now, let’s talk about the new Action button on the Pro models. I was curious about its functionality and if there were any limitations, but so far, I haven't found any. It essentially allows you to program it however you like, which I’m really pleased about. This feature has appeared on some Android phones in the past, and I hope it becomes more common.

Jumping into the settings, you’ll find the Action button option, which has a unique UI distinct from the usual settings pages on the iPhone. By default, it replaces the mute switch and offers two different haptic feedback patterns, so you know if it’s muted without having to look.

You can also set it to open the camera in any mode, but since the camera is already accessible on the lock screen, it seems redundant. The same goes for the flashlight function. However, I do like the voice memo trigger, as it immediately starts recording when you press and hold the button.

My favorite function by far is the Siri Shortcuts capability, which allows for customization. You can stack different functions based on your location or have it call a specific contact, or simply open any app on your phone without delay. For me, I’m mapping the Action button to Google Assistant—the best assistant available on the iPhone.

I was also curious about how cases would work with this new Action button, so I asked dbrand, one of our sponsors, to send over their new Ghost case. I think it looks great, and I can confirm that the Action button remains just as responsive and clicky, even with the case on.

Regarding the clear case, dbrand has designed the Ghost case to resist yellowing—a common issue with clear cases—which is why they offer a lifetime replacement guarantee if it ever yellows. That’s either a strong commitment or a way to offer free cases for life.

Additionally, I’ve been taking pictures and videos with the new cameras to assess their performance. I plan to post plenty on Twitter and Instagram. I will also shoot the next Auto Focus car channel video with this phone, so be sure to subscribe to see the quality in action.

They mentioned a new coating over the lenses during the keynote, and I was hopeful it would improve the nighttime flare issues in iPhone videos. However, after testing it in a dark room, it seems the coating didn't solve this issue.

Lastly, I want to clarify the new camera behavior on the Pro models. Initially, I was skeptical about the 1x versus 1.2x versus 1.5x options, thinking it was just a digital crop. However, it’s actually a set of Super Res Zoom presets that you can digitally zoom between.

Here are some benchmark scores for the A17 Pro if you’re interested in performance metrics. Overall, I feel like the base iPhone 15 models bring more improvement than they seem to on paper. There’s nothing drastically new, but with features inherited from last year’s Pro models, they are solid devices. The Pro models offer genuinely new features and some updates, including slightly larger batteries.

Let me know what you want to see in the full reviews in the comments below, as I’ll be working on those in the upcoming days and weeks. Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you in the next one. Peace.
