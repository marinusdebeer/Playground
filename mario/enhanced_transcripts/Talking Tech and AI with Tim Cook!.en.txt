- All right, Tim.
- Great to see you.
- Thanks for spending the time.
- Thank you for coming. So, you had the WWDC keynote today.
- Yeah.
- Which was really fun to watch. It was a whole two hours. I want to zoom all the way out because, obviously, there was a lot of talk about AI in general.
- [Tim] Yeah.
- I'm kind of left wondering how Apple defines AI overall, because I know if you ask a regular person, you might hear about generative AI, chatbots, things like that.
- Yeah.
- These are relatively new additions to Apple's AI portfolio. How do you look at AI as Apple?
- Well, we’ve been executing with AI for a long time.
- [Marques] Right.
- It’s at the root of the watch you’re wearing. If you think about things like crash detection, fall detection, and Afib, all of this is machine learning at the end of the day. But what has captured people’s imagination is generative AI. We see it as the opportunity for a whole new wave of technology that provides more assistance to people and improves their lives. So, that’s how we see it. Obviously, it’s not without downsides, which is why we approach it very thoughtfully.
- Sure.
- As you heard, we have always been focused on privacy, and privacy is a very key tenet of our approach to AI.
- Right. It’s been interesting to watch Apple’s arc with AI because I created a piece less than a year ago about how Apple seemed to never say "AI," even though they have all these neural engines and machine learning capabilities.
- Yeah.
- Now we see a pivot where we’re actively branding it as Apple Intelligence. I’m curious why that change happened.
- Well, in the beginning, and pretty much throughout everything we do, we always talk about the benefits to the user. The benefits are things like crash detection and fall detection, not the technology behind those features.
- Sure.
- We still view it that way, but it became clear that people wanted to know our perspective on generative AI in particular.
- [Marques] Yeah.
- So we decided to embrace it and brand it as Apple Intelligence.
- Okay. I have a quote from the Dua Lipa interview that you did.
- [Tim] Oh, okay.
- [Marques] That was great.
- [Tim] It was fun. She’s fantastic.
- I loved it. You had a quote about AI: "If it can be used for nefarious things, we won’t go down that road."
- Yeah.
- At the time, I assumed that meant generative AI was off the table because of concerns about its potential misuse. Has that changed? Is that something that was initially off the table, or do you now feel you have the right tools or restrictions in place?
- Generative AI was never off the table. It was always about pursuing it in a thoughtful way. That’s what we’ve done, and we’ve implemented it in ways that are less likely to create issues.
- How so?
- Well, we talked about personal context and privacy. We’re not waiting for comprehensive privacy legislation to come into effect; we already view privacy as a fundamental human right. That’s the lens we use, and given those principles, we wanted to deeply integrate this into the apps you’re already using.
- Right.
- So, you’re not having to think, "Oh, well, now I want to do something that uses AI." We’re embedding it deeply.
- Right. Now there’s a lot of talk about generative AI.
- [Tim] Yeah.
- Apple is notorious for keeping everything on-device because that’s the most secure way, and that’s been applauded. However, now, with larger models and more complex requests, you actually have to go off the device. You’ve developed something called Private Cloud Compute.
- Private Cloud Compute.
- Explain this, because a lot of people think they have to send data to OpenAI, for example, to make a request to ChatGPT.
- Well, Private Cloud Compute is different from our arrangement with OpenAI.
- Okay.
- If you look at Private Cloud Compute, we’re utilizing a similar architecture to the silicon in the iPhone.
- [Marques] Right.
- We’ve designed it so it’s as safe, secure, and private in the Private Cloud Compute environment as it is on the device. We’ve worked hard on this to ensure that. If you're working on something that requires world knowledge—beyond personal context—then you may want to use one of the large language models available on the market. We selected what we feel is the best option with OpenAI and ChatGPT, but you’ll make that decision consciously every time.
- Every time.
- So you can guarantee that there will never be any data sent to OpenAI without your explicit consent.
- That’s right. You decide.
- I also found it interesting that there was a brief interest in standalone AI devices, which didn't land too well. I think smartphones are pretty great, but you mentioned using AI to help reduce time spent on screens. This is something you echoed in the Dua Lipa interview—if you’re looking at your phone more than you’re looking at someone else’s eyes, something’s off.
- Yeah.
- Do you think there’s potential in the future for people to use their phones less because of how effective the Intelligence becomes?
- I think that’s a significant possibility. We’ve never been motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices. Our model doesn’t depend on engagement to succeed; it’s about empowering you to do things you couldn’t do otherwise. We want to provide tools for incredible possibilities.
- That’s the motivation behind initiatives like Screen Time, which makes users aware of their device usage.
- True.
- We count notifications so you can evaluate if you really need that many, and we have focus modes to help manage distraction. I believe as Apple Intelligence gets smarter, tasks that once took time will take less time.
- Right.
- I believe that opportunity exists.
- Interesting. It's a curious future.
- It is, and I’m really optimistic about it.
- Yeah. I also feel like there was a lot of chatter when you first became CEO about the shift from Steve Jobs, and now you’ve been CEO for quite some time. We’re entering a new age of AI, and there’s talk about who the next CEO will be. What do you think your legacy as CEO at Apple should be?
- Yeah, Marques, I don’t really think about it.
- Okay.
- To me, a legacy is defined by how others see you, not something you define yourself.
- Very fair.
- I’m typically focused on the future, not the past. That characteristic defines Apple as well; we don’t have a museum here, even though we could have plenty of nostalgic items on display. It’s just not part of our culture.
- [Marques] Yeah.
- Personally, it’s the same; at some point, there will be another CEO, and my focus will be on making them successful.
- Yeah. I like that answer. It’s very reminiscent of LeBron when he spoke about legacy.
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah. All right, I want to end with a little game. Have you seen these blind rankings?
- A blind ranking?
- A blind ranking. We’re going to rank the top five Apple products of all time, but I’ll give you them one at a time, and you won't know the rest.
- Oh.
- Okay.
- This will be your unofficial ranking based on your gut reaction.
- This is tough because...
- It is tough.
- It’s like picking your favorite among kids or nieces and nephews.
- We’ll see how it goes.
- Okay, number one: MacBook Air. It had that iconic moment of being taken out of the envelope on stage. It’s the most popular laptop in the world, right?
- It is. That moment of taking it out of the folder established a characteristic about that device that lives on today. Initially, it wasn’t about how many people would buy it.
- [Marques] Yeah.
- It was about establishing a foundation.
- Was that the first Air product?
- I believe so.
- Okay.
- I think that was indeed the first.
- Okay. Next: the iPad.
- Oh, wow. Tablets had been around for a while. Our goal is never to be first; it’s to be the best.
- I remember all the rumors leading up to it.
- There were many rumors, and people had mixed feelings about it initially, including the name. Yet, I personally can’t live without my iPad today.
- [Marques] Yeah.
- Another huge moment for the company.
- My number three is the Magic Mouse.
- The Magic Mouse was also a significant moment. People might overlook it compared to the MacBook Air and the iPad, but executing the ergonomics well was key.
- With the Magic Mouse.
- [Tim] Yes.
- Okay, number four: the iPhone.
- Oh my God. It changed the world.
- It definitely changed the world.
- The simplicity of defining the three core elements of the phone was brilliant. Initially, I’ll remind everyone, there wasn’t an App Store.
- Right.
- The App Store launched a year later and transformed the developer community. Now, I meet with students during WWDC who inspire me greatly. At that time, there were no students in the developer community. It’s now diverse in age, and it became an economic miracle for many, moving beyond just hobbyist projects.
- Yeah, and now we have WWDC.
- That’s right.
- Last but not least: Vision Pro.
- Oh.
- I love Vision Pro. I was just using it last night to watch a screening.
- Yeah. What do you use Vision Pro for? I ask everyone who has one what they use it for.
- I primarily use it for entertainment value. It’s excellent for multitasking; the multiple windows are very effective. I'm also reviewing various apps, both enterprise and proprietary, and there’s an extraordinary variety coming from the enterprise sector sooner than we predicted.
- Interesting.
- Businesses typically move slowly to adopt new technologies.
- [Marques] Yeah.
- However, we’re seeing that half of the Fortune 100 is now exploring Vision Pro for various projects.
- [Marques] Interesting.
- I find it still to be an emotional experience to look at photos, and with visionOS 2, being able to make old photos 3D is significant.
- [Marques] Yeah.
- I lost both my parents before Vision Pro launched, and revisiting those photos differently is a unique experience you can’t replicate.
- For sure. Well, we didn’t get a blind ranking, but we got a solid retrospective of some of these products.
- Yeah.
- Thank you again for your time.
- Thank you.
- I’m looking forward to when the next feature drops at the upcoming WWDC, but this was fun. Thank you.
- Yeah, it was great fun. Thank you for coming.
- Likewise.
