So, this smartwatch is priced at $69. But before you start typing, is it really worth it? I think we need to define "good" first. Going into this, I was amazed by the idea that you can get a fully functioning smartwatch for $69 in 2023. In a world where smartwatches can easily cost hundreds of dollars, that’s impressive.

Clearly, there is a wide range of capabilities in smartwatches. This one covers the basics: time, notifications, step counter, heart rate monitor, calorie counter, and sleep tracking. That's more than enough for about 95% of users, right? 

Let’s go over the fundamentals. This is a square smartwatch with an orange silicone band that feels similar to other smartwatch bands. It features a 1.96-inch diagonal display. While it’s marketed as metallic gray, the material feels more like plastic than a true metal. The site claims it's made of aluminum alloy, but holding it, you might think it's entirely plastic. The back part that touches your wrist has a matte finish and includes engravings in a minimalist font—model number and the company's headquarters in Cheapside, London, which is quite fitting. 

Honestly, it doesn’t look or feel terrible, but you can clearly see the shortcuts typical of a cheaper product. The bezels are thick and uneven, there’s no rotating dial, just a cheap-feeling button above a tinny speaker, and it charges with a basic USB-A to dual-pin cable, not a fancy puck. While the magnetic back is convenient, it lacks elegance.

However, everything works well enough. It reaches up to 600 nits of brightness, though there’s no auto-brightness feature, so you’ll need to adjust it manually. At its maximum brightness, it performs well indoors. Plus, it has an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance, which is great for exercise or rain. Interestingly, there was a time when OnePlus and Nothing products didn’t have IP certification due to added costs, but now the CMF watch does.

The watch syncs with the CMF Watch app on your phone via Bluetooth. If you’ve used a smartwatch before, the UI will be familiar. Your watch face is your starting point, and you can swipe through fitness data that resembles Apple Watch rings. You can view heart rate history for the past 24 hours, check the weather in a dot matrix format, and track sleep time if you use that feature. A single press of that plastic button takes you to a list of apps, which is available in either grid or list format.

There's a considerable number of pre-installed apps, including an exercise app with a variety of workouts, a blood oxygen measurement app, a phone call app (you can receive calls on the watch), and a music app for controlling playback on your phone. There's even a camera remote app. While it doesn't open your phone's camera app or show a live view, the shutter button works when the camera app is open. 

The voice assistant app opens Google Assistant on your phone, utilizing the watch's mics and speakers for interaction. The "Find My Phone" app is amusing; it only works when the CMF app is open on your phone. If the app isn’t open, it just prompts you to open it— frustrating if you've misplaced your phone. However, once opened, it plays a max volume ringtone to help you locate your phone.

The watch's UI operates smoothly without much lag when switching between apps, likely because they are lightweight. This device mainly acts as a Bluetooth accessory, transmitting simple controls to your phone. It offers a nice variety of watch faces, with one featuring an orange theme and a moving second hand being my favorite. 

It’s also very lightweight. While some may not prioritize lightness in watches, in this price range, they are mostly plastic. So, it's a plus that this watch is super light, making it comfortable for sports or daily activities. 

As a Bluetooth accessory, it can work with almost any Android phone. The Play Store app has a 3.1-star rating and has occasionally presented connection issues for me. However, its compatibility with various Android devices is better than what Apple offers for their smartwatch.

I'm able to track sleep since it only requires heart rate sensors, and I also get data from my mattress cover with built-in sensors. I'm sure you've heard of Eight Sleep's Pod Mattress Cover, which adjusts the bed temperature automatically and monitors your sleep. Their app provides personalized reports daily, covering heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep stages. 

I’m officially done using wearables for sleep tracking, as the mattress cover covers all my needs. Eight Sleep has listened to feedback and offers a free Sleep Report every six months, regardless of membership level, which is not behind a paywall. Thanks to Eight Sleep for sponsoring this video; they are offering the largest discount they've ever had. If you want to check it out, use the link in the description and code MKBHD.

Now that I’m not wearing the CMF Watch while sleeping, I can charge it each night. The magnetic pin charger isn’t as pretty as a wireless charging puck, but it’s very effective. I’ve found the battery life to be excellent due to its simple design. The website claims about 13 days of regular use, and while I may not reach that, I easily got three straight days without issue. Using Power Saver mode could extend that even further. It has better battery life than an Apple Watch.

What I’ve realized is that this smartwatch is actually on the pricier side for basic smartwatches, at $69. The cheapest options are often in the $20 to $50 range, which generally offer similar functionality. In comparison, the CMF Watch Pro offers better packaging, design, and appearance, for a slight markup—similar to how Nothing positions its products with appealing design.

CMF stands for color, material, finish—a nod to both the company name and the design philosophy. This smartwatch is silver-ish, somewhat fingerprint-prone, with a metallic appearance that feels plastic-like. If you squint hard enough, it vaguely resembles an Apple Watch Ultra. If that’s your comparison, then it’s a total bargain.

So, if you’re interested, it's worth exploring, although it may be a bit challenging to find in the U.S. Importing it could incur extra costs, but it’s an option. Now you know it exists! Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace!
