You know, if you've been watching my videos, you've noticed a certain phrase I've been using for years: small flagship phones are a rare breed. I've repeated this countless times over the years, but sadly, today, that's no longer true. That breed is now extinct. Rest in peace to the small flagship phone.

We don't even need to look too far back to recall when phones were generally smaller. But quickly, we moved to four-inch screens, then five-inch screens took off, and soon six-inch flagships were everywhere. While we never quite reached seven-inch phones becoming mainstream, all the biggest flagships now flirt with that size.

The amusing part is that smartphone manufacturers frequently come to the same realization: smartphone screens are getting bigger, leaving room for smaller alternatives to fit beneath that trend. For instance, I recently reviewed every single Samsung Galaxy S ever. When they first started to grow bigger, they also introduced a Galaxy S Mini. It was a quintessential Samsung move. But guess what? That version is now dead.

The same happened with Apple. They released large iPhones, and for two years, we had the iPhone Mini. But that’s now discontinued as well. This cycle continued until there was basically only one decent small flagship phone left: the Asus Zenfone, the last of its kind.

Released in 2022, the Zenfone 9 was almost a perfect flagship phone. It boasted flagship specs, remarkable performance, incredible battery life, and solid cameras. It won my small phone of the year award by a landslide, even with a few minor flaws, like a less durable back material and the absence of wireless charging.

In 2023, they launched a sequel, the Zenfone 10, which took a great concept and improved upon it. They addressed the back material issue, added wireless charging, and upgraded to the latest flagship chips without losing any features. It was simply an excellent flagship phone with a screen under six inches in 2023.

Now, it’s 2024, and the new Zenfone is a massive 6.8-inch ultra phone. Honestly, we probably should have seen this coming. Small flagships rarely last more than a year or two. However, it does hit harder because this was the last small option available.

Consider this: Apple is arguably one of the best supply chain companies in the world; that's how they've built their business. Tim Cook transformed their stock price significantly, primarily due to their supply chain management. When they launch a new line of products, they have to analyze and determine exactly how many units to produce. This involves complex studies and estimates for each SKU. They aim for just the right amount in inventory. 

In 2020, for the first time, Apple released a lineup of four new iPhones: the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, and the iPhone 12 Mini. The 12 and 12 Pro were the same size, representing a nice balance in the lineup, while the 12 Pro Max was the largest model with the biggest screen and price. The most pocketable iPhone, however, was the Mini. Tim Cook and the supply chain experts at Apple already knew that small phones generally don’t sell well. 

Despite this understanding and the necessary production adjustments, the reviews for the Mini were overwhelmingly positive. People loved the smaller phone, even if the battery life wasn’t as robust. It offered a flagship design, chip, and camera in a compact form, which was rare. Tech reviewers praised it, and users enjoyed it too. However, the iPhone 12 Mini sold dramatically less than Apple expected, sometimes accounting for only about 5% of total sales. 

The Mini quickly went from being the beloved option to the least successful iPhone launch ever. The media speculated whether Apple would try this again. They did release the iPhone 13 Mini, but it performed even worse and was eventually discontinued, with a new Plus-sized iPhone replacing it.

The takeaway from the iPhone Mini experiment is that not enough people buy small phones to justify continued production, even for a company as large as Apple. Positive reviews don’t necessarily indicate success, nor do negative reviews always lead to a product's demise.

And now we have the Zenfone. Not to diminish the Zenfone 11 Ultra, which is a perfectly good large flagship phone. It carries all the strengths of the Zenfone 10 to a larger scale, like a bigger battery, impressive battery life, the latest specs, and solid performance. It even added a third telephoto camera. However, it lacks the one distinguishing feature—the small size that made it unique.

This new Zenfone just blends in with the sea of other large phones. I suspect that even though the Zenfone 9 and 10 were celebrated, they didn’t sell well, much like the iPhone 12 Mini and 13 Mini. Interestingly, the most popular new iPhones remain the Pro and Pro Max models, the high-end options.

So, Asus responded by creating a high-end large phone. To be clear, Asus hasn’t officially stated that they won't produce a regular Zenfone 11, but their current actions suggest this could be the only model. They might have simply rebranded it, much like Apple moved from Mini to Plus.

This trend reflects the enthusiast phone dilemma. When a manufacturer creates an enthusiast phone, it garners a passionate following. However, as they attempt to expand and make the product more popular, they often lose their core fans. I don’t know if this new Zenfone will lose its dedicated followers, but those who appreciated the small design will likely feel alienated.

This trend is also seen in budget phones. Small budget phones are becoming larger too; for instance, the Pixel 7A measures 6.1 inches, and the recently released Nothing Phone 2 is considered oversized. There are even rumors that the next iPhone SE won’t be small.

The void left by the absence of small flagship phones remains. Someone might come along and briefly fill that gap, but don’t expect it to last long. Rest in peace, small flagship phone.
