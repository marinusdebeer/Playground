All right, so today I had the chance to check out and explore the new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models. As I was flying here, I thought about what Apple could possibly introduce with the 23rd iPhone that would be interesting. 

Beyond the iPhone, there were a number of other announcements at the Wonderlust event that Apple hosted, including several things that weren't even mentioned on stage. So, stay tuned and get subscribed to catch the full updates. For now, let’s focus on the new iPhone 15 and 15 Pro.

Coming into this, it's clear that everything Apple has added to their newest flagship models can largely be divided into two categories: features that we've seen in other phones for years and ecosystem features that only work with other iPhones. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it’s worth keeping in mind as we discuss these updates.

The iPhone 15 comes in the same two sizes as before: the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Plus. There are some minor changes, such as the slightly softened corner radii on the aluminum rails and the one-piece glass back that transitions between lighter and darker shades of the same color—like the new pink variant, which looks pretty seamless. Additionally, the entire lineup has a satin soft-touch finish instead of glossy, which I really like.

The headline feature this year is definitely the switch to USB-C. Lightning is officially out, and these new iPhones now feature USB-C across the board. On one hand, this is a significant development; it marks the second port change in iPhone history, the first being the transition from the 30-pin connector to Lightning back in 2012. However, on the other hand, USB-C is something we’ve already seen in numerous laptops and tablets for years. I imagine it will take another year or two for the baseline iPad and the iPhone SE to adopt USB-C as well. 

That said, it’s still surreal to see a USB port on an iPhone. So, what does this enable? Well, it's one cable that can ideally charge all your devices—your Mac, your iPad, your iPhone, your friend's Android phone, and even the new AirPods with their USB-C case. Oh, and you can now charge accessories like the new AirPods using a wired connection. While there's no wireless reverse charging now, you can use the USB-C to charge the AirPods directly from your iPhone battery, which is a nice touch.

However, Apple did hold back on one key feature, and they reserved it for the iPhone 15 Pro. More on that later. Aside from the USB-C, the iPhone 15 represents a moderately updated phone, featuring a slightly enhanced display with the addition of Dynamic Island and a higher peak brightness of 2,000 nits—double that of the iPhone 14.

The main camera is now a 48-megapixel sensor, likely the same as what was in last year’s iPhone 14 Pro, along with all the benefits that come with it. The rest of the phone follows a familiar formula; the new baseline model essentially re-packages the previous year's Pro phone, powered by the A16 Bionic chip.

One of the coolest features is the next-generation portrait mode that automatically detects subjects in a photo and captures all the necessary depth information, allowing you to add that portrait effect later without having to remember to switch modes. 

Everything else remains consistent: the same sizes, ceramic shield, dust and water resistance, and starting prices of $799 for the 15 and $899 for the 15 Plus.

Moving on to the Pro models—the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max—there are more updates to explore. Much of what I’ll want to test to validate their claims, so make sure to subscribe for full reviews later this month to determine if these phones are worthwhile. Most of the new features revolve around build quality, the chip inside, and the cameras.

For starters, the Pro models feature a brand-new chip called the A17 Pro. This is the first time Apple has used the term “Pro” for an iPhone chip, and it represents their first three-nanometer chip, promising performance and efficiency improvements. They claim it offers about a 10% increase in high-performance core speeds and that the neural engine is now up to twice as fast. While some of these enhancements might not be immediately noticeable in daily use, having future-proofing and extra headroom is always a plus.

A significant note regarding this chip is that it includes a new USB 3 controller, which means the 15 and 15 Plus models do not have this feature. The Pro iPhones' USB-C port will support faster data transfer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second, while the baseline iPhones will be stuck at the same USB 2.0 speeds they had with Lightning—480 megabits per second. While this probably won’t impact most users, it’s somewhat disappointing that not all devices will enjoy the full benefits of USB-C. For those shooting ProRes video or ProRaw photos, transfer times can still be an issue with the larger files.

Interestingly, there is still no implementation of fast charging. Discussed previously on the “Waveform” podcast, many expected that switching to USB-C would present Apple with a great opportunity to introduce better charging options. Yet, we continue to see the same 20-watt charging, which means charging still takes about an hour and a half to two hours.

Now, the new design of the Pro models has garnered a lot of praise. Apple transitioned from shiny stainless steel rails to a new grade 5 titanium alloy with a brushed texture. This change makes the devices noticeably lighter—something I appreciate. Additionally, this design update allows the Pro iPhones to be slightly slimmer, resulting in closer screens to the edges and thinner bezels, which I definitely notice.

There’s been talk of improved strength, but I think the impact may be overstated. The Pro iPhones have used stainless steel rails for some time, and while titanium is technically stronger, the reality is that when dropped, it’s often the glass that breaks. The ceramic shield glass on the iPhone 15 Pro has remained unchanged.

In terms of color options, you have black, white, a subtle new blue, and a natural finish that embraces the raw titanium look—similar to a warm tone reminiscent of last year’s "Starlight." Surprisingly, I might actually prefer this natural finish the most.

Another noteworthy mention from Apple’s keynote was the design change to the interior chassis, aimed at making the back glass more easily replaceable. This is a small but positive step towards improved repairability for the iPhone.

Now, let's talk about my favorite feature: the new action button, which is customizable and replaces the iconic mute switch. It’s located in the same spot and functions similarly—a long press switches between mute and ringer. However, diving into settings, you’ll find a comprehensive list of options for this action button.

You can keep its traditional function, switch between focus modes, auto-launch the camera in your desired mode, enable the flashlight, open voice memos, or even toggle the magnifier. The last option allows you to trigger a series shortcut, which can launch any app on your phone. While there might be a slight delay in opening apps, it’s a great feature that expands usability for the button.

Finally, the camera upgrades across the board include a larger 48-megapixel main sensor for the Pro models and an improved ultra-wide lens. The Pro Max model gets an intricate folding 5X telephoto camera, and the regular 15 Pro retains the 3X telephoto from last year.

Interestingly, there’s a new setting allowing users to change their default focal length to 1X, 1.2X, or 1.5X. Although somewhat hidden in the camera settings, it allows for quick access to your preferred focal length whenever you open the camera app.

In the end, many people feel that the biggest new feature of this year’s iPhone is the transition to USB-C. I still have a few Lightning accessories, such as the MagSafe Duo, AirPods Max, and Magic Trackpad, so I’m curious to see if new USB-C accessories will emerge following this change.

For instance, our sponsor, Anker, has created a new lineup for the iPhone 15, including the Anker Nano—a compact but powerful USB-C power bank that provides 30 watts of output and a small display to indicate remaining battery percentage or charging time.

The iPhone 15 Pro will start at $999, the same price as last year, but the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,199 and is the only model with the 5X camera. It will also have a starting storage option of 256GB—removing the previous $1,100 tier. 

Let me know if you’re interested in these new iPhones—are you indifferent, eagerly anticipating a purchase, or waiting to see if reviews prove they’re worth it? The comment section is always open. Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Don’t forget to subscribe! Peace.
