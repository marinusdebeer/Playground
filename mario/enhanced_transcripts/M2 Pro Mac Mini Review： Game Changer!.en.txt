Hey, what’s up? MKBHD here. This little machine that I can hold in my hands has more CPU power than a base Mac Pro right now. I hope that won’t be true for much longer, as the Mac Pro is overdue for its Apple Silicon upgrade. But the fact that it's true at all right now is absolutely insane.

This little machine is not only super powerful, efficient, and small, but it also comes at a really good price. In my previous video about the MacBook Pros, I mentioned that the Mac mini is actually the more interesting machine, and I genuinely believe that. It has just been refreshed from the M1 chip to now include the M2 and M2 Pro options, both of which are game changers in their own ways.

Starting with the M2 version, the base M2 Mac mini is a game changer because it includes all the benefits of the new Apple Silicon — the second-generation, five-nanometer process and blazing fast shared memory — all for a starting price of $599 in the US. It’s a straightforward computer, not even a small tower — just an incredibly tiny machine. It’s essentially a laptop without the screen and keyboard, available only in silver, and features a decent array of ports on the back, along with a small exhaust vent for active cooling and a headphone jack.

This computer packs an enormous amount of power for its size. We’ve seen the Apple Silicon transition unfold over the past two years, and when the Mac mini transitioned from Intel chips to Apple Silicon, it experienced an incredible leap in performance. Some of the numbers on paper are just ridiculous. You have to forgive me for using Apple's unlabeled charts, but it's important to illustrate how this has completely changed the nature of the product. The M1 Mac mini was already dramatically better than the Intel version for 99% of users, and now the M2 comes along with more cores, a more powerful CPU and GPU, increased maximum memory, and a higher overall performance ceiling. Plus, the price goes down from $699 to $599. Apple almost never lowers entry-level prices, but that's exactly what’s happened here.

So, we now have a computer that's more powerful, more capable, and more efficient — all for less money. Additionally, there's the M2 Pro Mac mini, which I've been testing and using. Previously, we only had the base Apple Silicon M1 Mac mini; now, with the M2, we also have this Pro chip that raises the performance ceiling for the Mac mini while maintaining the same tiny body. Well, I should clarify that the M2 Pro version adds two more Thunderbolt ports, so now it has four Thunderbolt 4 ports on the back, along with everything else.

This means you can now connect three external displays instead of two, and you can also option up to 10 gigabit ethernet if you have that type of internet connection, or if you work in an institution that can utilize that kind of networking capability. Yes, it does support HDMI 2.1 as well. The real highlight of this new chip, the M2 Pro, is that it's benchmarked even higher than the M1 Pro and M1 Max in the CPU department, which were the highest-end configurations in previous MacBook Pros. I had to do a double-take when I first saw this since the M1 Max has been phenomenal, but here we are; even the incremental improvements here are noteworthy.

Additionally, the thermal advantages of a Mac mini with active cooling in a taller chassis versus a MacBook Pro means you might see even better sustained CPU performance over time. This Mac mini’s performance is solid. As you move up from the base chip to the Pro to the Max, the improvements are mostly in GPU performance. The M2 Pro does well here, too, but the results tend to align more closely — it's an improvement over the previous generation, of course, but for applications that specifically take advantage of GPU performance, the Max chips are still the better choice.

On the other hand, everyday performance will remain excellent. The sustained multi-core performance ceiling is significantly higher, especially for tasks like video editing or app development, which involve longer compile or render times. That’s where the M2 Pro excels. This model starts at $1,299, which isn’t cheap, but when you consider that the M2 Pro MacBook Pro, with the exact same system on a chip, starts at $1,999, it becomes a much more appealing option.

That’s the main reason I’m calling these Mac minis a game changer: their performance per dollar. You typically don’t expect that from a Mac, but if I were to create one of those charts showing performance per dollar, you would see that the Mac mini offers the same performance for less money — the line would be higher.

For so long, Apple has prioritized laptops, which is understandable as they’ve been very successful and popular. However, some people buy a laptop and end up keeping it in one room all the time because desktop options aren’t as appealing. If we're being honest, the iMac is cool, but it’s not for everyone. Right now, it feels like Apple has low-key forgotten about the iMac. It’s still sitting with the unupgraded M1 chip, even though the M2 is available. They introduced the Mac Studio, which is excellent, especially in the higher-end configurations, and I can't wait to see the M2 Ultra, but the Mac mini now fits nicely underneath all of that.

With the modularity of a desktop, you can choose whatever display you want instead of being tied to a built-in monitor. It’s funny; in recent reviews, I've been trying to touch on sustainability where it’s relevant. There are some neat aspects with this machine, like its recycled aluminum and plastics, but all of that still pales in comparison to the flexibility of continuing to use your existing display and swapping out displays as you wish — unlike the iMac. 

Call me crazy, but I think many people may not want to be stuck with a non-upgradable display, webcam, and white bezels forever. Plus, if you already have a display you like, you can simply continue using that. I haven’t covered the Mac mini since the “Fastest Mac Mini in the World” project I did back in college. Shout out to those who subscribed back then! I took the highest-end Mac mini available in 2012 and maxed it out, upgrading to the fastest RAM and SSD it would support to create the most capable tiny machine for a college dorm room with limited space. Clearly, my priorities back then were video editing over homework.

Now, the M2 Pro Mac mini has all the power that I would have killed for back then as a budding creator with limited space, and it costs less. I had to look back and remember that I spent $1,759 for the fastest Mac mini back in the day. This one exceeds it in terms of performance and capability. Of course, the trade-off here is that none of the tightly integrated parts are upgradable, so you need to think about spending a bit more to account for the long-term ownership without the option to upgrade. You might want to consider getting a little extra RAM or storage, depending on your use case.

This Mac mini can handle just about any footage you throw at it. And by the way, if you’re a student like I was back then, don’t forget about the student discount — that typically gives you a hundred bucks off. So with these machines, it brings the base M2 down to $499, which is fantastic.

In conclusion, if you're considering which Mac to buy right now, think of it this way: If you already have an Apple Silicon Mac like the M1 generation, you're good. There’s no need to buy a new Mac every year; those machines were a great upgrade over Intel. If you have an older Mac and are genuinely looking to upgrade, I’d recommend starting with the base M2 Mac mini at $599. I wouldn’t buy the iMac right now since it still has the M1 and costs $1,299 for a non-removable 24-inch display. Instead, go for the Mac mini and pair it with a display of your choice.

If you know you need a portable solution, the laptops are impressive. You can get an M2-generation MacBook Pro, and they are excellent, which I just reviewed. If you're looking for a discount, an M1-generation MacBook Pro is also a good option right now.

With each lineup, remember the big difference between M2, M2 Pro, M2 Max, and eventually M2 Ultra, is GPU performance. So, it shouldn’t be a surprise that they’re similar in CPU performance. If your applications take advantage of the GPU, that's when you should consider upgrading.

That’s pretty much it. It might be a little surprising, but for price and performance, the Mac mini is a huge winner. The Mac mini might make me miss removable memory, but it certainly makes most high-end media machines feel pretty average. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.
