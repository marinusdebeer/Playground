- All right, welcome to the Smartphone Awards 2022. It's one of my favorite videos, and y'all knew it was coming. It's a bit of a tradition around here to revisit the smartphones that came out during the calendar year 2022, where I recognize and reward some of the best, the worst, and some interesting developments that happened throughout the year. There's usually a lot to cover, and we often forget about various releases, but this is one of my favorite videos to make. We even have, of course, no spoilers, but we’ve got some trophies for the winners; they're super nice.

From flagships to midrange phones, budget options, specialty phones, and folding devices, I got to use them all. I have my own opinions about each, and some of you may agree with my awards, while others may disagree. One thing is for sure: these awards are mine. So, without any further ado, let's start handing them out!

The first category is Best Big Phone. If you look at this table, it's clear that phones have gotten bigger over time, to the point where pretty much every phone is considered big. However, I still want to reward a phone that makes great use of that space, as you desire a large screen, a big battery, maybe large speakers, good cameras, and an overall thoughtful use of that extra room.

So, my winner for Best Big Phone of the year, which actually came out near the beginning of the year, is Samsung's Galaxy S22 Ultra. 

(gentle music)

In terms of hardware, this device pretty much does it all. It has a big 6.8-inch display, one of the best in the business, and it added a stylus while still including a 5,000 mAh battery, which is the same capacity as the previous year. It features multiple high-quality cameras on the back, a pair of excellent telephotos, good speakers, good software, and really no hardware flaws to speak of. You might even say it was kind of boring, which I think is a good thing because if you're spending this much on a phone, you don't want anything to seem too unusual. This phone, in a way, returns to the functionality that the Notes usually provided in the past.

I also like to give runner-ups and honorable mentions in these categories. So for Best Big Phone, the runner-up is the ASUS ROG Phone 6. It's actually quite similar to Samsung's flagship but lacks a few features. It's a bit more specialized—no wireless charging—but it has a screen on the back and is much more gaming-centric. I must shout out its incredible massive stereo front-facing speakers and the headphone jack. Big phones should include space for a headphone jack!

I’d also like to give an honorable mention to the Xiaomi Mix Fold 2. It didn’t have an IP rating and wasn’t widely available, but it represents a breakthrough in folding phones as it folds to about the same thickness as a normal phone. This marks a significant moment in the development of folding devices, making them feel closer to everyday usability—big phone, smaller package.

Next category: Best Small Phone. Here, we're on the other end of the spectrum—there aren't many small phones available, making this a rare category. To be honest, this wasn’t a tough decision. Last year’s winner, the iPhone Mini, was discontinued, so it wouldn't even qualify. Thus, Best Small Phone of the Year goes to the ASUS Zenfone 9. This phone is so nice!

(gentle music)

They made many great decisions across the board. It's small—relative to other phones—with a 5.9-inch display, flagship specs like the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, 1080p higher refresh rate OLED, great software, tons of RAM, and incredibly fast performance. What surprised me the most was the camera quality. If a phone this small can have a headphone jack, then what’s everyone else's excuse?

There are some weird flaws, like the soft touch back that discolors easily, but I was genuinely surprised by the battery life on this phone. There aren’t many things that genuinely surprise me in the smartphone world anymore, but this device's small size combined with excellent battery life makes it easily the best smartphone in this size category.

I do have a runner-up for this category, which is the Oppo Find N2. This compact, passport-sized phone has flat edges and still features a solid folding display inside. I haven't done a full review on it yet, but it feels like a sneak peek at what a folding Pixel might look like, which is intriguing.

Now let’s move on to the next category: Best Camera, or better yet, Best Camera System across the board. A good camera involves photo quality, video quality, capture speed, autofocus reliability, ease of use, and file formats, among other factors. 

This year, we conducted an interesting blind smartphone camera test on a website we created, allowing people to vote on their favorite photos across three different categories. We had 16 different phones competing, and surprisingly, the overall winner was the Pixel 6A, with the Pixel 7 coming in as the runner-up. These are clearly great cameras, but I'm not awarding them the trophy for the best camera system.

I’m also not giving the trophy to the vivo X80 Pro+ or X90 Pro+, which excel in low light with their impressive sensor combination and software. My winner for Best Overall Camera System in 2022 is the iPhone 14 Pro.

(gentle music)

This has now become the longest defending champion in this category, as it's the fourth year in a row that the iPhone has taken home the camera trophy. The image quality is solid, but it's the speed to open the camera and capture a photo that stands out, along with fast autofocus. I’d rate the Pro iPhones around an A-minus to a B-plus for photos, but when it comes to video capabilities, it’s in a whole different league. I've been running the auto-focus YouTube channel for a couple of months, focusing on cars shot entirely on smartphones, and the difference is remarkably clear when comparing the iPhone’s camera to others.

It’s how good it looks, the audio quality, the consistency of color, the ProRes capabilities, and the sharpness. I much prefer shooting videos on iPhones, and I don’t think I’m alone in that regard. Sure, it still takes a while to transfer files from the iPhone, and I hope they correct that. Nevertheless, it’s the winner for Best Camera System.

Next up is Best Battery Overall. This is likely one of the more objective categories, encompassing more than just battery size. I want to consider the entire battery experience: how long it takes to charge, how long it lasts, battery feature flexibility, and longevity.

My winner for Best Battery in a 2022 phone is a defending champion: the ASUS ROG Phone 6.

(gentle music)

This phone boasts a massive 6,000 mAh battery and supports 65-watt fast charging, allowing you to go from zero to full in under an hour. It also includes numerous battery management features. For example, you can reduce the refresh rate from 165 Hz all the way down to 60 Hz to extend battery life. There are also charge limit features and pass-through charging options. This phone excels in terms of battery life experience, and it charges quickly. The only downside is that it lacks wireless charging, which most other phones in its price range include. But for worry-free battery performance, the ROG Phone wins.

I’ll give a runner-up in this category to the iPhone 14 Plus. Many of us expected this when Apple discontinued the Mini iPhone in favor of a bigger model without the ProMotion OLED display. This unit features a simple 60 Hz display powered by a large battery, with wireless charging and all the other features Apple provides to maintain battery health. It offers a solid battery experience.

I’d also like to give an honorable mention to the ASUS Zenfone 9. It continues to amaze me with its battery life, despite having a 4,300 mAh battery without wireless charging. The charging speed is decent, but I was genuinely surprised by how well this compact phone held up in terms of battery life. Who knew a phone this small could boast such great battery performance?

Next up is the Design Award. This is perhaps the toughest award to give out each year due to its subjective nature. It has evolved over time from being simply about build quality to focusing on unique design elements. In recent years, it has become less about safe designs and more about who can take risks in terms of appearance, as there’s often a process of elimination involved—it's hard to give this award to overly safe designs or phones that regress from previous models.

This year, the Design Award goes to the Nothing Phone. 

(gentle music)

This design stands out as arguably the best aspect of the device—it employs a transparent look while featuring a glyph interface with lights on the back that illuminate for notifications. They can also function as a fill flash for video and indicate wireless charging status. While it treads the line between gimmick and feature, I find it unique. It’s neat to see battery life as you are charging. This level of innovation is rare in the smartphone realm, and the rest of the phone is quite good as well. Thus, I’m happy to give the Nothing Phone the Design Award for 2022.

I also want to acknowledge the Xiaomi Mix Fold 2. Several folding phones were released this year, but this one particularly stood out as the first to reach a thickness comparable to that of a typical phone. With design improvements since previous generations, this phone feels very usable and pocketable while providing the benefits of a larger unfolded screen.

Now let's move on to the Value Award, which I enjoy giving. This one was quite competitive this year. Rather than calling it Best Budget Phone—which means different things to everyone—I refer to it as Best Bang for the Buck. You know you’ve found a good one when a phone hits a great price point at launch.

My winner for Best Value Award goes to the Pixel 7. 

(gentle music)

This phone launched at $599 and is one of the best devices you can get for that price. It's clear that it embodies the complete Google flagship experience, powered by the same tensor chip and main sensor as the higher-end model. It has an impressive 90 Hz flat OLED display. The Pixel 7’s value is remarkable; it's hard to recommend the 7 Pro, which is $300 more. This device is simply excellent, so I’m thrilled to highlight it as one of my favorites this year.

The ASUS Zenfone 9 is also among the best options, launching at $699. It showcases the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, substantial RAM, and a 120 Hz flat OLED display. This phone also comes with a side-mounted fingerprint reader, a headphone jack, and impressive battery life. These two phones are both outstanding—it's tough to choose between them.

An honorable mention goes to the Realme 10 Pro+. This device features a large 6.7-inch display, a 5,000 mAh battery, and surprisingly good camera performance, even outshining some $1,000 phones in our blind smartphone camera test. It’s a solid package for about $350.

Now we arrive at the Bust of the Year award. While I don’t enjoy giving it out, it’s necessary. Many phones played it safe this year, leading to some rather boring options—some devices might have been too safe for their own good. However, I won’t fault devices that closely resemble their predecessors, provided the previous iteration was well received.

This year's Bust of the Year goes to the OnePlus 10T.

(gentle music)

It wins for having a significant gap between expectations and the actual product delivered. Not all of this can be attributed to OnePlus, but the brand has been on a gradual decline in value, reputation, software experience, and camera quality. There’s just not much to be excited about, and it feels like the brand’s identity has eroded rather quickly. Following a previous flagship featuring Hasselblad tech, the 10T releases without that enhancement, leaving many wondering about the current direction of OnePlus. So, congrats, OnePlus, on your Bust of the Year award.

Finally, we have the MVP award for the most valuable phone. This is not the same as the Value Award; instead, it’s about the overall favorites combined with the best experience and impact on the industry. There are many great smartphones to choose from this year, but picking an MVP was challenging for me. 

I have two MVPs for this year. My top dog, my number one MVP award for 2022 goes to the Pixel 7.

(gentle music)

This phone is genuinely deserving; as mentioned in its previous win, it offers great value, exceptional cameras, and a fantastic display with an outstanding software experience and solid battery life. There really isn’t much missing, making it an incredible overall device.

I also feel compelled to mention the ASUS Zenfone 9. 

(gentle music)

This phone had numerous positive attributes and was a big surprise for me this year. The design resonates well with me, even if it doesn't handle wear and tear the best. It’s not equipped with wireless charging, but the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 enables remarkable performance, while the battery life was truly impressive.

The Zenfone 9 includes a headphone jack, a speedy side-mounted fingerprint reader, and notably good cameras. Its performance in our blind smartphone camera test ranked it among the top devices. Launched at $699, it proves to be an excellent option.

Lastly, I want to give an honorable mention to the reliable Galaxy S22 Ultra, which has all the essential hardware features. While it doesn’t stand out with anything particularly new, it possesses one of the biggest batteries, the best display, and an impressive camera suite in the market. It’s a solid overall phone and well-deserved of its awards.

That concludes the Smartphone Awards of 2022. Feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments below. I know all of you will have opinions on this, as you do every year, and I look forward to discussing it. Also, if you're a company watching and you want your trophy, reach out to me on Twitter or something—I’ll happily ship it out.

Thanks for watching!
