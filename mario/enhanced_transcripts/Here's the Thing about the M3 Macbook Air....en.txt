It's crazy that the most interesting aspects of this new laptop are actually the reasons not to buy it. The MacBook Air has just been refreshed, and it's a pretty simple update—maybe even a boring one. There are really only two new features: it has a new anodized finish on the outside, which is supposedly slightly more fingerprint-resistant, and it comes with the new M3 chip inside.

Honestly, the coating doesn't make much of a difference. It still gets fingerprints if you handle it regularly without a skin or case. I would much rather depend on something like a skin from channel sponsor Dbrand. It allows you to customize the colors and will hide fingerprints much better than any metal treatment ever could. Plus, these skins are real leather, so they have a nice plush texture and will patina over time. I'll leave a link to that below.

Now, about the M3 chip. We've seen this chip before; Apple tends to use the same chip across different devices. The M3 chip was announced in October of last year and was quickly integrated into the iMac. Then we got a new MacBook Pro with the M3, M3 PRO, and M3 Max chips. So, this is the new base M3 chip finally making its way into the MacBook Air. Side note—why does it take so long? It feels like Apple staggers these releases on purpose. While they've released the iMac, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air with the M3 chip, the Mac Mini is still on the M2, which is kind of odd. And what about the iPad Pro? Still on M2. When is that going to get updated?

The MacBook Air is the most popular Mac for a reason. It’s typically the entry-level Mac that most people see as their gateway into the Mac world. By design, the base MacBook Air has always been one of the easiest laptops to recommend. However, this time around, for two reasons, it isn't as straightforward.

First, this has nothing to do with the performance of the M3 chip. You can expect the performance improvements you're looking for. Benchmarks indicate a 10 to 20% improvement over the M2, depending on usage. This generation leans more heavily on graphics improvements, and ray tracing is finally included. For applications or rendering that take advantage of that, you'll see a noticeable improvement. Additionally, MacBook Airs—especially the 15-inch model—are known for their great battery life. You also get dual external display support with the lid closed and one external display when the laptop is open.

Regarding base storage, the M3 offers significant improvements. If we look back at the M2, the base 256 GB model used a single SSD module instead of two, resulting in slower performance that was about 50% slower than the M1 on paper. While you might not have noticed the speed difference without benchmarks, it was disappointing to have noticeably slower storage in a new M2 device, leading to longer transfer times for large files.

I'm happy to report that I've seen really good benchmarks on the base storage of the M3 Air, so it seems they’ve fixed that issue—great news!

So, what's the deal with the M3 Air? Why am I saying it’s not necessarily the best recommendation? Historically, the MacBook Air has been straightforward to recommend, but with this M3, Apple has also lowered the price of the M2 by a hundred bucks and discontinued the M1. Now, the lineup includes the M3 MacBook Air starting at $1,099, the M2 MacBook Air at $999, and while the M1 has been discontinued, you can still find stock left at retailers like Walmart or Best Buy.

This ease of recommendation for the MacBook Air relates to regular users—those who primarily engage in light tasks like web browsing, listening to music, having multiple tabs open, working on documents, or occasional light tasks like photo editing and video editing. These users would likely be perfectly fine with the cheaper, identical-looking MacBook Air with the slightly slower M2 chip and slower storage. I think most would be totally happy with that option.

Now, let’s address the base spec issue. This isn’t unique to Apple; it’s a common marketing tactic across the tech industry, akin to how the car industry advertises starting prices. The "starting at" price often doesn't reflect what most people actually pay once they customize their options. Apple’s markup for upgrades is absurdly high, making the base price feel more deceptive. 

The MacBook Air starts in 2024 at 8 GB of shared RAM and 256 GB of storage. Ignoring the fact that the phone I’m using has more RAM and storage, the first available RAM upgrade to 16 GB costs $200. Bumping up to half a terabyte of storage costs another $200. These prices, given Apple's scale, are just outrageous. So even if you upgrade, the MacBook Air M3 can quickly escalate to $1,500. 

You have two choices: accept that you’re essentially paying over $1,500 for a MacBook Air, or question whether the base spec in 2024 is usable. My answer? Sometimes, yes. If you’re among the group of people I mentioned earlier, those buying a laptop for basic tasks, you likely can perform those tasks just fine with 8 GB of shared memory. People rarely max out their RAM and hit memory swap. Even if they do, it's usually still manageable. It’s when you start doing heavier work like media encoding, exporting, or gaming that it becomes an issue.

If you're watching this video, you know which group you belong to. For those who primarily do lightweight computing tasks, skip the new M3 MacBook Air. You can easily opt for the M2 MacBook Air and save money. In fact, if you don’t need the brighter display, MagSafe, or the external display support—features you probably don’t need right now—it’s worth looking at the $600 to $700 M1 MacBook Airs available at retailers. Walmart recently advertised the M1 starting at $699, and Best Buy quickly followed with a $649 offer, which is fantastic.

While the M3 is undeniably more capable and elevates the laptop experience, what Apple silicon has done is raise the minimum level of machine that can perform your workflows. For example, I edit a lot of videos and need the power for Final Cut Pro. In the past, I could only use high-end desktops, but now I can edit on a Mac Studio or even on my M1 Max MacBook Pro on the go, which is a huge advantage. 

The same applies to gaming or heavy coding. With Apple silicon, you can perform those tasks on a high-end MacBook Air, which is a fantastic option. So, in summary, if you need a powerful machine and do substantial work, the M3 MacBook Air is great and should be on your shortlist. But if you're engaged in light, everyday tasks, consider the cheaper options instead.

That's it! Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you in the next one. Peace!
