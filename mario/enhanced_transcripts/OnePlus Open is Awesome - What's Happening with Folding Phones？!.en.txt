All right, we need to talk about folding phones for a moment, as they have changed significantly since the last time we discussed them. This week marked the release of the first-ever folding phone from OnePlus, called the OnePlus Open. While the name may not be the best, the device itself is an impressive first-generation foldable.

I've been using it for about three weeks and have lots of positive feedback. In fact, I think it's so good that it has revived the old question in my mind: What will it take for regular people to start buying folding phones? Yes, I like this phone, and I suspect that other reviewers and enthusiasts will appreciate it too, and this video may garner a lot of views. However, none of that necessarily means that everyday consumers will actually walk into a store or browse online to purchase one.

First things first: let's talk about the details of this phone. It's a high-end device in every aspect, with a particularly well-considered design. The OnePlus Open is roughly the same size as a regular phone on the outside, featuring a 6.3-inch, 20:9 cover display that just exceeds 1080p. It uses LTPO technology, which allows it to scale down to 10 hertz, and it boasts an impressive maximum brightness of 2800 nits within fairly thin bezels. This display now holds the record for the brightest screen I've ever seen in a smartphone, and I would say it shares the crown for the best foldable to use while closed with the Pixel Fold.

While I still prefer the button placement and reachability of the Pixel Fold, given that it's slightly shorter, the OnePlus Open undeniably feels like a flagship device even when closed. I appreciate several design touches, including the flat sides that give it a clean look. The alert slider is back, positioned at the top of the phone, making it somewhat difficult to reach, but it functions just as you’d expect, similar to previous OnePlus phones. The power button also serves as the fingerprint reader, which we've seen on other foldables as well, and it's fantastic.

The back of the phone is a mixed bag for me. I'm not a fan of the faux leather finish, as it reminds me of Samsung's designs from 2016. However, it does hide fingerprints well. There's also a new color option in green, which looks a bit cleaner. The prominent camera bump is another standout feature; while it's quite the visual statement, it serves as a comfortable rest for my index finger when holding the phone closed.

Opening the phone reveals why OnePlus took their time to release a foldable device. The internal display is a stunning 7.8 inches corner to corner, using LTPO 3.0 technology that ramps up to 2800 nits and down to 1 hertz. The bezels are uniform all around, with a hole punch in the top corner, and it has one of the least visible creases I've encountered in a folding phone in 2023.

It's a bit debatable whether we can truly call this their first foldable phone, as OnePlus's sister company OPPO already has a foldable on the market. The recently released OPPO Find N3 shares many features with this phone. Regardless, with the screen on, the crease is virtually invisible, and even when the display is off, you have to look closely to find it. This device looks impressive from nearly every angle in regular use.

The hinge mechanism allows the phone to stay at any angle, whether you're going for a 90-degree position or something more open or closed. It shuts with a satisfying spring-loaded clap. The OnePlus Open is impressively thin—not the thinnest I've seen, but still commendable. Surprisingly, it's lighter than you'd expect, weighing roughly the same as an iPhone 14 Pro with a stainless steel finish.

In terms of software, the OnePlus Open runs on OxygenOS 13.2, featuring various tweaks and functionalities that power users will love. This device clearly caters to power users, offering seamless continuity between the open and closed screens. Once you finish using an app, you can close it and resume on the outside screen, similar to the Pixel Fold. The home screen setup mirrors automatically between the cover and inside screens, which keeps them organized, although I wish I had the option to alter that setup since I'm a power user.

The multitasking capabilities on the inside screen are significant, letting you run multiple apps simultaneously. You can use one app full screen or have two apps side by side and include a third in a triple-panel view. Quick app switching and the ability to see all open apps with a four-finger pinch make this a well-designed hub for productivity. When I open this phone, I feel ready to tackle my tasks efficiently.

The OnePlus Open hits all five of my pillars of excellent smartphones: great screen, great battery, great build, great performance, and great camera. I truly mean that it excels in each area. The screens match well inside and out, and performance is top-notch with high-end specs, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB of fast RAM, and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. The dual 120Hz LTPO displays offer a 240Hz touch sample rate, ensuring responsiveness and a future-proof feel. Battery life is excellent with a 4800mAh battery and 67-watt fast charging, though it lacks wireless charging, which seems like a missed opportunity given that many competitors now offer it.

The large camera module suggests high-quality cameras, and testing confirms that the setup is decent. The configuration includes a new stacked sensor for the main camera, a 3x telephoto lens, and an ultra-wide lens. Most of the time, it performs well, but it struggles with motion capture. If you're photographing moving subjects, the shutter speed may not be fast enough, requiring you to switch to action mode, which increases the shutter speed but also raises the ISO, resulting in noisier images.

This isn't one of my five pillars, but I found the microphone quality surprisingly good, which is often not the case with smartphones. Overall, the OnePlus Open combines all these features into a device that I believe many people, myself included, will enjoy using.

Now, why do I think folding phones aren't being purchased as much, despite their quality? A phone can excel in all five pillars and still not appeal to the mainstream for various reasons: first, the price; second, durability concerns; and third, the notion that these phones are targeted toward power users.

This phone is priced at $1700, which is a significant amount of money for a smartphone, regardless of payment options. It's literally twice as expensive as an iPhone 15. However, it aligns with its folding competitors—like the Pixel Fold and Samsung Z Fold 5, both priced at $1800. In that context, this phone could be seen as a bargain. 

Durability is another concern. While there are tests backing up its durability, such as a million-fold hinge rating and IPX4 water resistance, I’ve started to notice dead pixels near the hinge on my unit after just three weeks of careful use. This doesn’t guarantee everyone will experience the same issue, but it raises questions about long-term durability compared to traditional smartphones.

Lastly, folding phones are primarily geared toward power users. While folding and unfolding features are exciting for tech enthusiasts, they don't necessarily drive high sales volumes. We've seen similar patterns with LG and Sony, who focused on advanced camera features but struggled with overall sales. It wouldn't surprise me if folding phones are not leading sales in any company's lineup.

An impressive piece of folding phone hardware I've seen is the HONOR Magic V2. It's sleek and boasts high-end specs, a thin profile, and minimal crease visibility when opened. However, despite its attractions, it still faces the same challenges for regular consumers: price, durability, and the added thickness of a foldable phone compared to a standard one.

We are inching closer to mainstream acceptance with flip phones like the Samsung Z Flip 5 priced at $1000 and the new Motorola Razr 40 expected to launch at $600. However, we need more options like these for folding phones to gain wider appeal.

To conclude, while folding phones have evolved dramatically, there's still a long way to go before they become mainstream. Until then, they remain a source of excitement for tech enthusiasts. Thank you for watching! Catch you in the next one. Peace.
