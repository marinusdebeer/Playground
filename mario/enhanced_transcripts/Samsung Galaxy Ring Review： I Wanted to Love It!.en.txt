I've learned a lot about rings and about myself during the past week of testing the Galaxy Ring. It’s been quite an adventure! I’ve had it resized, contemplated some existential thoughts, and I may have a hot take on smart rings versus smartwatches. So, buckle up!

Smart rings have been around for a while now. The Oura Ring launched about 10 years ago as a Kickstarter project. The main advantage of these rings is that you can wear them 24/7 — 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Galaxy Ring has a battery life of about seven days, allowing you to live your life without worrying about charging it constantly. You can wear it while eating, sleeping, showering, swimming — whatever — it fits seamlessly into daily life.

To me, the most impressive aspect of the smart ring is how closely it mimics the dimensions of a regular ring, which is something some people would wear. Keep in mind that if you have smaller hands, it may appear larger. It’s 2.6 millimeters thick, so it does sit a bit bulky on your finger, but apart from that, it looks quite normal. I’m amazed at how much technology they’ve packed into this tiny frame. By technology, I mean a small battery and a few basic sensors. But when combined, you get an all-day activity tracker that you can put on at the start of the week and forget about, providing valuable insights into your health, sleep, and energy levels. At least, that’s the ideal usage scenario.

Since I had never worn a ring before, there was a learning curve to get used to it being on my finger every day. Additionally, there are some best practices for wearing this particular ring. For instance, there is a correct way to wear it. All the sensors are aligned on one side of the ring at the bottom, marked by a little notch. You should position these sensors facing the palm side of your hand for the best readings, and it’s recommended to wear it on your index finger, not your ring finger.

Once you get this figured out, you should see all your data in the Samsung Health app, including calories burned, steps taken, and miles covered, all aggregated into one energy score out of 100. I was wearing my Apple Watch Ultra while testing the ring and noticed that the readings from the ring and the watch were significantly different. The ring seemed to be overcounting regular activity but underestimated the number of floors climbed. There was a substantial discrepancy in the numbers. At one point, I took off the ring around 10:00 PM, but it continued to show heart rate readings until 03:00 AM, when I definitely wasn't wearing it. That seemed a bit odd.

Previously, I conducted a challenge where I walked 1,000 steps using several smartwatches and a pedometer, and they were all within a few percent of each other in accuracy. So, I tend to trust the watch numbers over the ring’s. This brings me to the importance of sizing. With a ring, you only get one size, unlike a watch that can be adjusted.

You may have seen the ring sizing kit from Samsung. You can buy it on their site for $10, and it includes a variety of different plastic versions of the ring that also have the sensor nubs. You try on different sizes to find one that is snug but won’t fall off. Once you find the right size, you get a $10 discount on the actual ring. 

I mention this because I mistakenly used the sizing kit incorrectly and ended up with a size 11, which was a little too big when I received the actual ring. It felt loose and uncomfortable, which resulted in gaps in my sleep readings — likely because the ring slipped off my finger while I was asleep and wasn’t able to track anything. I later got a size 10, which felt much better. Interestingly, wearing the ring on the index finger provides a better measurement for heart rate and other vital signs than the back of the wrist. This is a lesser-known fact about smartwatches — the back of the wrist isn't the optimal place for accurate readings.

Now, here’s an insight that using this smart ring taught me about myself. All the benefits are still true: it's certainly more wearable than a watch 24/7, and its week-long battery life is legitimate. After a few days, you can almost forget you’re wearing it, and you don’t need to dress it up or down for different outfits. It features a simple concave titanium design available in three colors: gold, silver, or matte black. Personally, I find the matte black fits just right.

However, I’ve realized I’m not a big smart ring person. The primary activities that I care about most require me to have nothing on my hands. Ultimate Frisbee involves a lot of throwing and catching, while golf doesn’t work well with a ring either. Even weight training involves a lot of grip work where wearing a ring isn’t feasible. For those major activities, I take the ring off, which defeats the purpose of a fitness tracker that’s meant to monitor my workouts.

I did keep the ring on for some lighter plyometric workouts, and it offers automatic workout detection. However, for those lighter sessions where I’m not moving quickly or raising my heart rate significantly, the auto-detection didn't function very well for me. When it came to sleep tracking, there were instances where the ring indicated I didn’t go to sleep until midnight when I was actually in bed earlier than that. I discovered this because my smart mattress cover, the Eight Sleep, recorded everything accurately. 

Speaking of which, this video is sponsored by Eight Sleep! I recently shared how their two-times-better cooling performance enhances my sleep quality, helping me reach more consistent high sleep scores. Plus, the autopilot feature adjusts temperature and elevation throughout the night, optimizing sleep conditions. Their Pod 4 technology is clinically validated to increase total sleep time by up to an hour and deep sleep by up to 2.5 hours a month, while also reducing wake-up time by up to three hours monthly. So, I genuinely enjoy it!

If you want to check one out, visit EightSleep.com/mkbhd for $350 off a Pod 4 Ultra or $200 off a Pod 4. With that savings, you could almost buy a smart ring! But, back to my main point: if I’m taking the ring off during my most important workouts, then this clearly isn't a great fitness tracker for me. Even during lighter activities, my wrist device, which has a screen, allows me to start a workout and track specific periods, which is essential for monitoring my fitness.

In conclusion, I like the idea of the ring, but it’s just not for me. It’s unfortunate because I appreciate its minimal design, with no notifications — it never vibrates or makes noise, and it doesn’t have a speaker. It serves as a subtle 24/7 wearable tech that you can wear for a week at a time, which is a brilliant concept. Samsung even designed a sleek case for charging the ring inductively from the inside, along with clever LEDs to indicate battery status for both the case and the ring itself. It can charge the ring up to 1.5 times with its built-in battery.

The Galaxy Ring is not meant to replace a smartwatch; rather, it offers a different type of product within the same ecosystem. However, there is a limitation: it’s compatible only with Samsung Galaxy phones, not any Android devices. While I currently have a Samsung phone, should I change to a Pixel or another brand, I wouldn’t see why I wouldn’t just opt for an Oura ring or an Ultrahuman ring — both offer similar features and are compatible with any Android phone. 

At the end of the day, this ring is geared towards individuals who already own a Samsung phone and prefer the wearability of a ring over the functionality of a smartwatch. A smartwatch is undeniably more functional but less wearable in some contexts. This ring emphasizes simplicity, which leads me to the one feature I wish it had: a tiny speaker or possibly an ultra-wideband antenna. Something that would make it easier to locate if lost. The ring is tough to find once misplaced — the app includes a Find My feature that shows the last GPS location when connected to your phone and can light up the internal LEDs for visibility in the darkness. However, if it’s hidden away in a pocket or underneath something, your chances of finding it are about as good as locating a regular ring.

Unfortunately, that’s the predicament I found myself in. My previous ring fell off at some point and I never managed to find it. So, Samsung, if you’re watching, apologies for that! I hope I can find it one day and return it to you. That’s my feature request along with fixing the issue of receiving inaccurate heart rate readings until 03:00 AM — still a bit creepy.

Anyway, that's all for now. Thanks for watching! Let me know your thoughts, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace.
