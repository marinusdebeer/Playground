So there are two types of people in this world: those who find AirPods comfortable and those who don’t. There are people who love silicon-tipped in-earbuds and those who hate them. There are also those who really need noise cancellation and those who don’t care about it. But Apple wants to cater to both types of customers, which is why there are two versions of the new AirPods this year.

It was a bit confusing how they announced it at the keynote, but essentially, you have the base AirPods 4 for $129, and for $179, you can get the AirPods 4 with noise cancellation. However, that’s not the only difference between them. After testing them for a few days, I can share the verdict on their differences and whether they're worth it.

Let’s start with the AirPods themselves. They’ve slightly tweaked the shape, giving these buds new curves and angles, allowing the driver to point more directly into your ear with fewer reflections. The stem is a bit shorter, but overall, they still look and feel like AirPods—very familiar. They have IP54 dust and water resistance, up from IPX4 last year. They still have in-ear detection and microphones all around. My biggest question, however, was whether this new shape fits better in my ear.

Honestly, I haven't had any luck with hard-tipped AirPods since their inception. The latest version was the closest I’ve come to a good fit, but even then, they would fall out after about 10 seconds of jogging. So, do the 4s fit better for me? Slightly, but not enough to make a huge difference. When I tried to get them seated properly, I still felt them slowly coming out, even while just sitting still. If you struggled with previous AirPods, you might still have issues with these, but if the original AirPods fit you, then these should fit just fine too.

Everything I’ve mentioned thus far applies to both the base AirPods and the active noise-canceling version. They share the same size and shape; you can’t distinguish between them just by looking at the buds. Where the differences begin is with the new case. The case is a bit smaller and now features USB Type-C, which is a welcome change. However, the base version’s case is simply that: a case with USB-C.

The noise-canceling version's case has a small speaker at the bottom, allowing it to chime when charging and make a noise when it’s lost. It also supports wireless charging on the back, which is super convenient. One downside, though, is that the new case doesn’t have MagSafe anymore, likely because it’s just slightly too small. The previous generation's case would align perfectly with MagSafe chargers, providing a seamless charging experience. This year's case, however, doesn’t stick to the charger, which is a bit disappointing. 

Despite this, I noticed the magnets holding the AirPods in place feel more secure than before. This case also works with Apple Watch puck chargers, but it’s not your regular charger; it exclusively charges Apple Watches and AirPods. Interestingly, the traditional pairing button found on the back of AirPods 3 has been replaced with a hidden capacitive touch area just beneath the pairing light on the front. A double tap activates pairing mode, while a triple tap initiates a factory reset—an innovative change.

Now, the pressing question many are likely asking: how good is the Active Noise Cancellation in these new AirPods? Should you consider getting it without opting for the AirPods Pro? My reference point will be the AirPods Pro 2. While these new earbuds are impressive, they're definitely not as effective as the Pros due to the physical differences. The hard tips don't create a perfect seal in my ear, leaving some air gaps that allow sound in from the outside.

The Active Noise Cancellation works reasonably well at lowering background noise, so you can hear your audio better, though it doesn’t eliminate noise completely. If I had to rate noise cancellation effectiveness, I'd say the AirPods Pro are around an 8 out of 10, while these new hard-tipped AirPods are closer to a 4 or 5. They're more about noise reduction than complete cancellation, making them useful in louder environments, like on a train or airplane, but not as effective in quieter settings.

Importantly, every pair of headphones with noise cancellation should feature a transparency mode, and these do as well. This may very well be the best transparency mode I’ve experienced on any AirPods. It sounds natural because some outside noise naturally seeps in, enhancing the overall effect.

Battery life does take a slight hit with Active Noise Cancellation—rated for four hours—but it offers a total of 20 hours when used with the case. These new AirPods now join the AirPods Pro as the only headphones with ultra-low latency support for Vision Pro, courtesy of the H2 chip. The built-in speaker is handy for locating the case if it's buried in a bag or under something.

Additionally, during the Apple keynote, a refresh for AirPods Max was mentioned alongside these new models. But I use the term "refresh" lightly because the only updates were switching to USB Type-C and offering new colors—no material changes or sound quality improvements. This lack of updates is quite ridiculous, and I won’t be reviewing those headphones.

As for the H2 chip, it primarily handles all processing, especially from the microphones, improving background noise reduction during calls, enhancing Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency mode, and Adaptive Audio. It even allows you to nod or shake your head to interact with Siri. For instance, you can nod to answer a call or shake your head to decline a text response—this feature works remarkably well.

However, it’s a matter of principle that $550 over-ear noise-canceling headphones shouldn't lack the latest technology. 

In terms of sound quality, the new AirPods are solid. The AirPods 3 made a respectable improvement, and while there’s no EQ customization, they perform decently across various applications. These AirPods excel in making phone calls and podcasts sound great while maintaining a good balance for music and movies.

So, the prices are $129 for the base AirPods and $179 for the version with Active Noise Cancellation. Now you know the differences, the capabilities, and how well they perform, allowing you to decide what suits you best. Personally, I still prefer silicon ear tips for a more secure fit, which significantly enhances noise cancellation. I’m leaning towards AirPods Pro, especially since they’re available for around $199 on Amazon—only $20 more than the new models.

Nevertheless, many will happily save that $20 and opt for the hard-tipped AirPods. It’s worth noting that they might not excel in specific categories compared to other earbuds, like fit for exercise, battery life, or sound quality. However, they are still AirPods, which means they offer seamless integration within the Apple ecosystem and a balanced frequency response across various uses.

If you’re considering a new pair of AirPods but dislike the typical design, check out our channel sponsor dbrand, which offers the new Area 51 case. This isn't just any regular design; it features a unique topographical pattern with a remarkable 3D-printed texture you can actually feel. The 3D ink is durable, adding an extra layer of grip that’s hard to describe. 

Moreover, dbrand crafted this design using an actual topographical map of Area 51—naturally! The Area 51 skins come in red, yellow, and black. I usually prefer matte black, but this nice yellow looks pretty slick.

These new Area 51 skins are available for an array of devices, so I’ll leave a link in the description for anyone interested in picking one up for themselves.

That’s all for now! Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you soon in the next one. Peace.
