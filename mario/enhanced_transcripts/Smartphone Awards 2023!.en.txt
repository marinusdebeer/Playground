All right, welcome to the Smartphone Awards 2023! A lot of smartphones come out every year, and this year is no different. We have all kinds of shapes, sizes, features, and budgets—a ton of phones! 

So, like clockwork, at the end of the year, you can count on me to pick some favorites across various categories. This is a summary of the best and some of the worst phones of 2023. These are my picks.

I always know I’ll get some pushback on certain categories. I’m sure I’ll hear it in the comments, and I'm fine with that. But these are my choices, and I’m sticking with them. 

The way this works is I’ll break this down into the usual categories, with each category featuring one winner. Plus, of course, there can be a runner-up and maybe some honorable mentions if we're feeling generous. We’ve had custom trophies made for the winners, and lately, the companies that win actually request them and sometimes end up displaying them in their headquarters, which is super cool for the recognition. So, we’re doing it again!

Without further ado, let’s get started with our first category: Best Big Smartphone. This is a fun category, as smartphones have been growing over the years, and they seem to be getting bigger. At this point, it feels like they’ve stopped growing. Am I the only one who feels this way? It seems we’ve all agreed not to pass the seven-inch screen size; anything over that feels ridiculous.

So, all these big companies are pushing right up against that seven-inch screen size, trying to fit as much as possible into these phones. There’s a lot of competition in this category. My winner for the Best Big Phone, the best use of that space in 2023, is the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. 

Once again, this phone came out at the beginning of the year—a bit of a sleeper—but it holds steady throughout the year. The design is pretty understated, which is probably why it goes under the radar. It has all the hardware you could want: a corner-to-corner 6.8-inch display that’s super bright, quad HD, LTPO, 120 Hz. 

It features quad cameras on the back and a 5,000 milliamp battery. It’s powered by the second latest generation Snapdragon chip. Again, it was released in January, and it has room for a stylus inside without really sacrificing anything. This thing is packed with hardware and has received software updates all year, with many more promised. 

It’s tough to pick just one standout feature. It might not be the huge 1440p screen or the 200-megapixel main camera, but I actually think it’s the massive zoom. For anyone interested in shooting subjects from far away, this camera system feels unmatched. It’s perhaps a bit boring, but it’s my clear pick for Best Big Phone of 2023.

I do have a runner-up, and it’s not-so-obvious. With these new phones blurring the lines, I’m giving my runner-up for Best Big Phone to the OnePlus Open. It definitely deserves a mention because, when it’s open, it becomes almost an eight-inch square display. This folding phone has all the hardware and software features you could want, and I really enjoyed using it this year, despite its size.

I also want to give honorable mentions for Best Big Phone to the Asus ROG Phone 7 and the Oppo Find X6 Pro. Neither of these phones is lacking anything. The boring choice won, but maybe if this one had wireless charging or that one had more zoom, it could have been in contention. Still, these are two excellent giant phones that came out this year.

Next up: Best Compact Smartphone. This one is tough, as the pickings get slimmer every year. Smartphones are getting bigger and even the smallest phones from the biggest companies are moving further away from being small. For example, do we call the Pixel 7a small? That’s a 6.1-inch screen. Or the Galaxy S23, the baseline model, which is also 6.1 inches. 

It’s increasingly challenging to find a truly small phone that has all the flagship features. However, one phone really stood out. My pick for the Best Small Phone is the Asus Zenfone 10. This flagship packs everything you need and more in a phone that you can actually use with one hand, with a 5.9-inch display.

I’m thrilled this phone exists. When I reviewed the Zenfone 9 last year, I said it was nearly perfect but just missed a couple of things. When I reviewed the Zenfone 10 this year, they fixed those nitpicks, added wireless charging, improved the durability of the back, and made some software tweaks. It’s nearly flawless.

If you’re considering buying a small phone, honestly, this may be one of the last good ones available. If you're in the market for a mini smartphone, act fast because they’re disappearing. The only other phone that could technically qualify would be some of the folding or flipping phones. Chief among them is Samsung’s Z Flip 5. 

When it’s opened, the Z Flip 5 has a 6.7-inch screen, but it folds down to a much smaller form factor than others. So even though it’s not the most one-hand-friendly device, it qualifies as smaller. A shout-out to the Z Flip 5 for the honorable mention.

Now, onto the Best Camera in a smartphone for 2023. I have a soft spot for this category because I love cameras, and you already knew that. There have been a lot of intriguing developments pushing the boundaries for smartphone cameras this past year, especially concerning optical hardware and software processing, including AI.

I might make an entire video just on how crazy it’s gotten, but my pick for the best camera of 2023 is the iPhone 15 Pro. This is my camera king, and I have absolutely no regrets about it. Many people like to point out that there are smartphones—even some on this table—that can produce better photos than the iPhone in certain situations, especially for zoom.

However, when it comes to overall performance across a broad range of situations and ease of use for both photos and videos, the iPhone is still king. Particularly for video, it remains unchallenged. The iPhone captures the best, most consistent, usable videos across the largest variety of situations more than any other smartphone. 

This year, they also added log recording to the Pro models and can record directly to an external SSD. There was an Apple keynote earlier this year that was shot entirely on the iPhone, and it looked incredible. Some of you may remember that Samsung did a live keynote years ago, but you could tell it didn’t measure up. 

This phone produces incredible results. If you told me I could only have one smartphone camera for the next five years, I think I would quickly say, “All right, let’s go with the iPhone 15 Pro.” I’d also like to give an honorable mention to the Galaxy S23 Ultra. This phone, particularly for its zoom capabilities, has been an excellent stills camera for a long time.

I reviewed it and found that the 200 megapixel feature didn’t yield a dramatically better outcome than the 100-megapixel cameras, but it’s still really good. Shout out to the winners of our scientific blind smartphone camera test that we ran online this year. 

We collected data from 20 smartphones that came out in 2023. The overall most popular winner for standard photos was the Pixel 7a. For low-light photos, the winner was the iPhone 15 Pro, and for portrait photos, the winner was the Pixel 8 Pro.

Next category: Best Value. This has shifted over the years; it used to be called Best Budget Phone, but I’ve expanded it to Best Value Option. This category is the hardest for me to pick this year. There’s good competition in high-value options, but many phones have had price hikes this year, with base prices going up. 

Many phones that used to win budget awards are now more expensive. So I have to decide what qualifies as best value. We all agree a $1,000 phone shouldn’t win Best Value, right? After much deliberation, I finally landed on what feels like a sweet spot: a phone without standout features but nothing wrong with it. 

This phone can usually be found for well under $400—the Samsung Galaxy A54. It has everything you need and nothing you don’t. You could go more premium for additional features or go a little cheaper and notice some corner-cutting. But this phone strikes a solid balance. 

It’s like when someone asks how your day was, and you say, “Oh, it was fine. Nothing remarkable happened.” That’s this phone. Its cameras? Fine. Battery? Fine. Screen? Fine. Design? Fine. Everything is just fine for $400. So for that price, you’ll be just fine.

I also want to give an honorable mention to the Moto G Play, which I reviewed when it came out at $169. I was very impressed with it, considering it’s a decent phone at that price—90 Hz and everything! A shoutout to the Pixel 7a, which went up to $500 this year. It gained a 90 Hz display and better specs, still doing everything you expect from a Pixel, so it deserves recognition for being a good phone at that price.

Next up is Best Battery. This doesn’t necessarily go to the phone with the highest battery capacity; I’m more concerned with the overall battery experience. Ideally, that phone comes with fast charging, wireless charging, or long-lasting convenience. 

My winner for Best Battery this year is the iPhone 15 Plus. This phone just goes and goes! Its bigger battery, paired with a 60 Hz display, accounts for this amazing battery life. If you want a risk-free, no-brainer for great battery life, this is it.

I also want to give a shout-out to the ROG Phone 7. It doesn’t have wireless charging, but it boasts pretty fast charging and the biggest battery capacity of any phone I’ve used this year at 6,000 milliamp hours. If you drop it down to 60 Hz, it too just goes and goes.

Another Asus phone, the Zenfone 10, is impressive as well. It’s not the biggest battery, but it effectively manages power, killing background apps and probably omitting some bands in the U.S. Somehow, this small 5.9-inch phone manages amazing battery life; it can easily last two days. Hats off to Asus for producing great battery life.

Best Design is a tough category, as design is subjective. What I find appealing, others might consider unattractive. It feels like every phone has some flaw that disqualifies it from winning, such as having a huge notch or a plastic frame. 

Then it hit me—one phone made headlines this year for its design, and I completely agree that it deserves recognition. It’s the Honor Magic V2. This device shifted my perception of phone hardware. It’s under 10 millimeters thick when closed, which is the same thickness as many standard phones.

It has a full-sized screen on the outside and a corner-to-corner foldable display on the inside. Astoundingly, it houses a 5,000 milliamp battery, the largest I’ve seen in any foldable. With 60 plus watt charging, a triple camera setup, and a terabyte of internal storage, this phone showcases what’s possible in a foldable.

Even if the rest of the phone might have some questionable aspects, the design is universally impressive. Everyone I’ve shown it to has been impressed. This brings us to our first new category in a long time at the Smartphone Awards: Best Foldable Phone. 

This year, I’m genuinely separating and considering all the folding phones released. There’s now a large variety of shapes, sizes, and versions in the foldable and flippable phone market. 

While folding phones are on the doorstep to mainstream adoption, they’re still mostly thicker and more expensive than traditional phones. I want to recognize those pushing the boundaries toward that revolution.

The winner for Best Foldable Phone in 2023 is the OnePlus Open. This is a fantastic device! When I thought about what folding phone I’d genuinely want to use daily, this one stood out. When it’s closed, it feels most like a normal phone, thanks to its relatively standard screen size and flat sides. When you open it up, you get a nearly eight-inch, almost perfectly square folding screen with a minimal crease. 

The specs and software are excellent, and it offers many fun features. My favorite aspect is the way you can manage multiple windows visually, allowing them to extend beyond the edge of the screen. It provides a unique, effective way of multitasking on a phone, and that’s incredibly useful. 

It’s undoubtedly the best folding phone released in 2023. I also want to give an honorable mention to the Pixel Fold. Particularly, I find this phone is my favorite to use when it’s closed because its external screen is so good. 

That outside screen is compact, reachable, and extremely practical, and I love that about it. I’m going to provide an honorable mention to Samsung’s Z Flip 5, which feels like it’s leading the pack for flipping phones. I think it’s better than the Razr and many other flip models.

As far as build quality and quality control, Samsung is at the top of the heap. Most other folding phones have had quality control issues, yet Samsung, despite earlier complications, has ironed those out over time. That’s their reward for diving in early. I also want to give an honorable mention to the Honor Magic V2 purely for its design—super impressive!

Now, onto the Most Improved Award. It's interesting because many phones play it safe with only slight evolutionary changes or spec bumps from last year. I can’t be mad at that if the phone was already good. 

For me, the Most Improved Phone for 2023 is the Nothing Phone 2. This award is partly based on hardware and partly software improvements. They didn’t change the hardware significantly since the first Nothing Phone, as they were still establishing their identity. 

They have a newer, higher resolution LED pattern on the back and a slightly curved glass for better handling. Overall, it still looks like a Nothing Phone, but the software improvements, especially with Nothing OS 2.0 and then 2.5 on Android 14, are fantastic. 

They focused on efficiency, smoothness, and adding new features that the original phone doesn’t get, like better glyph controls, clone app features, and monochrome themes. It all adds up to a significant improvement. 

In a world where most people could easily buy last year’s phone and be satisfied, I can confidently say you should consider the Phone 2 over the Phone 1. However, don’t expect to send blue text bubbles, as that won’t happen. So, Phone 2 is much improved, which is a positive for putting them on the map!

An honorable mention goes to the iPhone 15 for its transition to USB Type-C. That’s a pretty big change!

Next up: Bust of the Year. This is the award no one wants to give out, but one of these phones on this desk will win Worst New Phone of 2023. I have to preface this by saying it’s genuinely difficult to find a bad phone nowadays. Most phones, regardless of price, are either good for the money or at least okay for the money.

However, this year, there was one disappointing phone: the Solama Saga Crypto Phone, which I’m crowning as Bust of the Year. There is no price at which I could recommend anyone purchase this phone. Buying it feels like buying a timeshare—appealing at first but painfully regrettable upon realization.

This phone has some redeeming qualities, like decent build quality with ceramic materials and a pleasant heft. However, that quality is wasted on this phone. The backstory made it apparent things wouldn’t go well. I’ll link to the full video I did about it if you want to dive deeper into that disaster.

I’m also giving an honorable mention to all the concept phones announced this year that never materialized—and likely never will. You know who you are.

We’ve made it to the biggest trophy of the night—the same size as the others, but the most important. It's the MVP, the Most Valuable Phone. This isn’t about monetary value; it’s truly about my favorite phone of the year.

Ultimately, it comes down to identifying the best phones that impact the industry, those that are the most fun, the most unique and innovative, with the greatest features. This combines all of that into one recognition for the MVP, the Phone of the Year for 2023.

What will it be? There have been some fascinating stories, disruptive models, and remarkable phones this year. My winner for MVP, Phone of the Year for 2023, is the Pixel 8. Congratulations to the Pixel 8—it has significantly improved over last year! 

This phone boasts several differences from its predecessor, but the standout is its $100 price increase over the Pixel 7, so it really has to deliver to be worthy of that. And it does! With a fantastic camera, it may not be miles ahead of previous years but still delivers great photo quality.

Additionally, it has a dramatically improved display at 120 Hz, with a flagship-level brightness of up to 2,000 nits. It’s powered by the same Tensor G3 chip as the Pro model, which costs several hundred dollars more. On top of that, it has an impressive array of software features matching the more expensive Pro model, making it more challenging to justify that higher price tag.

With all these perks and promising seven years of software updates, the Pixel 8 represents an incredible well-rounded package for its impact and price, making it a standout phone of the year. 

I also have a runner-up. I genuinely love this phone, though it might not be the most popular. It’s the Asus Zenfone 10. After last year’s success, this phone does it again in a compact package that’s nearly perfect. 

It’s small and accessible, with surprisingly good cameras, excellent performance, and remarkable battery life. There’s very little to criticize about this phone. The Zenfone 10 is outstanding, and I recommend watching the full review.

Lastly, I want to give an honorable mention to the iPhone 15 Pro. This model feels like the pinnacle of the iPhone experience. While past iterations could have been deemed “peak iPhone,” with its USB Type-C and absence of the notch in favor of the dynamic island, this truly feels like a finalized product. 

There aren’t many other significant advancements I expect other than potential fingerprint readers or fast charging in future iterations. For now, this is undoubtedly the best iPhone yet.

Two quick mentions go to the ultra-boring S23 Ultra for being a solid, flawless phone. It consistently gets overlooked when considering the best of 2023, despite being a fantastic device. 

I also want to give a shout-out to the OnePlus Open, as the foldable phone I’d genuinely recommend to real users. While most people might not spend $1,800 on a foldable phone, if they were to buy one, this would be the phone I’d choose to use daily.

That’s it! Those are my Smartphone Awards for 2023. Let me know your thoughts—I can’t wait to see which phones you would have chosen for your awards. Maybe others will create their own lists too, but I’m quite happy with my selections. Until next time, catch you later. Peace!
