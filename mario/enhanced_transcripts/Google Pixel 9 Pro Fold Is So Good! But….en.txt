- All right, so the first thing I did when I got back from Australia was catch up on everything I missed. I put my SIM card in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and I was really impressed. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been so surprised, given how good the other Pixel 9s are. But still, folding phones are challenging to design, and the second generation of any product tells you a lot. Even though this is called the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it's technically the second one; the first Pixel Fold was released last year, and it was solid. It was one of my favorite foldables to use when closed, thanks to its passport-style aspect ratio, but it did have some trade-offs, particularly concerning its price. This new model makes some significant strides forward.

Let’s start with the design. There was a lot of chatter about the camera bump on the back because of its appearance, which is admittedly a bit strange. However, it doesn’t bother me much. It’s not the biggest issue, although I do wish it was wider like the other Pixels for a more consistent look, similar to the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro. But you don’t focus on it for long, and I assume it looks this way due to the complex internals of a folding phone. The rest of the design, though, is quite nice. First of all, it’s much thinner, and they’ve flattened the sides all around, resulting in a more modern, squared-off shape like many other flagship phones.

Interestingly, the rounded sides from last year actually made it easier to pry open the folding phone. You’ll notice this if you use both phones back-to-back, but it’s not a dealbreaker. There are numerous other refinements as well—the hinge is smaller, and the sides now have a matte finish instead of being glossy. So now you have matte sides and a soft-touch back. Overall, it feels much closer to a regular slab when it’s closed. It’s not fully there yet—we’re not fooling anyone—but it folds to just over 10 millimeters thick, which is comparable to many other phones released in the past year.

The main change, of course, is that it’s no longer the smaller passport size; it’s now a full flagship size with a 6.3-inch, 1080p, dynamic 120Hz AMOLED display. It’s big—the previous model was definitely easier to use with one hand. Now it’s more akin to the size of the OnePlus Open, right around the upper limits of what you can effectively use with one hand, though your mileage may vary depending on your hand size. There are also noticeable bezels all around the display, which pushes it slightly off-center. Nevertheless, I find it very usable and it feels more like a regular phone than ever before, which I consider a win.

I really like the cover screen. Upon opening it, the advantages of the taller aspect ratio become evident, as you transition from a 7.6-inch screen to a slightly narrower but taller 8-inch display that’s nearly square. The screen itself is significantly better, now offering up to 2700 nits brightness. It’s nice and bright and features LTPO technology, while the cover screen does not, for some reason. The bezels have also improved immensely from the first folding Pixel. They’re still a little thick, sure, but they are now evenly spaced all around the screen, and there’s a punch-hole cutout for the selfie camera in the corner instead of a thick bezel. Just look how thin that is—barely thicker than the USB-C port.

This would have sounded insane just a few years ago, but I would wager that nearly everything about the hardware of this Google phone is at or above average, which is impressive. It’s as if the harder the component is to make, the better it becomes. The new hinge is smooth, allowing the phone to open and close in a very satisfying way, and it unfolds all the way flat with ease, unlike last year’s model. The crease in the middle is average at worst, but you can easily overlook it when viewing content on the screen. They’ve packed a 4650 milliampere-hour battery inside, which is slightly above average for foldables, even if it's a bit less than last year’s.

The speakers in this thin body are impressive and full. The water resistance is rated IPX8, and the flatter fingerprint reader is quick and easy to use. Overall, this hardware feels worthy of the "Pro" designation more than ever before. Even though they renamed the phone to include "Pro" in the title, it truly feels deserving of it. However, some minor things, like the outer display not being LTPO, feel odd, especially since that's the one that does the always-on feature. Charging isn’t particularly fast, either, and it lacks Qi2, meaning that the phone has a lower-than-normal wireless charging coil, which can be tricky to line up and may not work with certain chargers. While that might seem like nitpicking, when you're talking about an $1800 device, you can be picky.

Design-wise, I feel they got a lot right. It reminds me of the OnePlus Open from last year, which won my best folding phone award. But this one is a Pixel, and the Pixel software experience really sets it apart from many other folding phone options out there. Sure, there are flashier foldables with advanced hardware from companies like Vivo and Xiaomi, and there are razor-thin devices with eye-catching specs. But if I’m being honest, the software on those devices typically doesn’t match the quality.

With this phone, you get all the features of the rest of the Pixel 9 flagship lineup, which is fantastic. There’s call screening, the Pixel weather app, and all the new features—everything except the thermometer app, which is fine. Gemini is improving, like I noted in the Pixel 9 review, and I still love Circle to Search. However, on this inner screen, you need to be a bit more cautious since the distinction between "hold to circle to search" and the tiny swipe to bring up the dock can take some getting used to. There are also plenty of foldable optimizations, such as two-column layouts for various Android features, notifications, the settings app, and many first-party apps. I’ve been enjoying the larger screen because it enhances multitasking and allows multiple apps to be open simultaneously. Personally, I often use picture-in-picture mode with a small YouTube video while I read an article in full-screen mode; all of this is much better on this phone compared to last year.

This runs on Android 14, which is the same as all the other new Pixels, but I’ve put the Android 15 beta on my old Pixel Fold, and it has some additional folding optimizations that I hope will be rolled out soon. Google promises seven years of software updates on the Pixel 9 series, which is impressive.

I’ve mentioned a lot of nice things about this phone, but even before I put my SIM card in, I was aware of two main downsides to consider: the underpowered Tensor chip and the downgraded camera system. Let's start with the cameras. Yes, they have smaller sensors than the standard Pixel models, and yes, the results aren’t as good, but they’re not terrible. The photo style remains consistent—contrasty and high dynamic range—but my main observation is that they lack sharpness. This issue becomes more apparent in lower light, where the photos tend to be softer and lose detail quicker because the smaller sensors struggle to gather enough light. I’d say it’s on par with a Pixel flagship from a couple of years ago, like the Pixel 7 Pro.

That’s always been a compromise with high-end folding phones—they offer the same software features as other models, but for $1700-$1800, you’d expect maximum quality. However, fitting all the same camera sensors into a phone with additional hardware and a hinge can be a challenge. If photography is a major reason you buy phones, this might be a hard pill to swallow. But if your reasons for purchasing lie elsewhere and you’re not a big camera person, you may overlook this.

Personally, I rely heavily on my phone for photos and videos, so that lack is tough for me. The other downside is the Tensor chip. Google’s Tensor has never been class-leading in terms of power or efficiency; I’d say it’s good enough for the phones it’s in. However, if you plan to do high-end gaming or want a phone that lasts for more than a few years or boasts exceptional battery life, then the Tensor chip holds these devices back. People are curious about when Google will compete with Qualcomm's flagship chips. The Tensor G4 in the Pixel 9 line, including this model, is solid and is paired with 16GB of RAM, which is great and certainly helps with AI tasks as well as running the rest of the phone. However, it’s not incredible, leaving you to wonder whether the phone will truly last for the promised seven years of updates.

Rumors are circulating that the next Tensor chip might be the first fully custom chip designed by Google, manufactured at three nanometers, and could potentially represent the needed leap in power and efficiency. If you’re excited by that, you might want to wait. It's odd to say this is one of the best folding phones I’ve ever used while suggesting you wait, but I think you should consider it. You wouldn’t want to make a costly purchase and regret it next year.

But if that doesn’t resonate with you, the phone as it stands today feels great. It looks great, performs smoothly, and I’ve experienced about six hours of screen time on average with mostly small screen activities. During the small percentage of time I open it for more significant use, the battery does drain a bit quicker. Nonetheless, I feel productive with this phone. It genuinely feels like I have two phones: a regular-size flagship when it’s closed and a mini tablet ready for multitasking and productivity apps whenever I need it. This has been an awesome device.

Oh, and speaking of being ready to go at any time, I wanted to mention that the new Ridge Wallet I designed is finally available. It’s a full-grain leather wallet that’s been well-received. It features RFID blocking, is lightweight, has two easy-access pockets, and can hold up to eight cards, along with cash if you like. I’ll link it below if you want to check it out. I’m really proud of it.

Look, if you’re not into foldable phones, this device might not change your mind. It has the same dimensions and functionality as its predecessor; it’s not a game changer. However, for foldable enthusiasts, this phone has been a joy to use. It feels like a full flagship when closed and a mini tablet when opened. Two phones in one—that’s the ideal foldable for me. This is my favorite flagship foldable that I’ve ever used. So there you have it; hopefully, Android 15 will come soon. Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace.
