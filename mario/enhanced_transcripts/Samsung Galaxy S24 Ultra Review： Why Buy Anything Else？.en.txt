All right, you have $1,300 to spend on an Android slab phone in 2024. Why would you get any other phone? No, seriously, why would you choose anything else? The S24 Ultra has taken the best features from every other ultra high-end phone and integrated them into one device, maximizing everything you could possibly value. It really sets the tone for 2024.

Samsung's Ultra phones have evolved over the years. Initially, it was all about having the highest numbers—biggest megapixel count, most zoom, and so on. Then they added the S Pen, refined the design, and effectively replaced the Note. Now, it’s just everything in one place. It boasts top-tier hardware and software all in one phone.

On the outside, this phone may look similar to last year’s model, but if you think it’s just a repeat, you’re missing a lot. The more you use it, the more you look for weaknesses, and the more impressive it becomes. 

If you’re a screen enthusiast, you’ll want to consider this. The S24 Ultra features one of the best displays available, dropping in a class-leading 6.8-inch quad HD AMOLED display that is simply outstanding. These ultra phones have had 120Hz LTPO for a while, but now, it’s completely flat and significantly brighter. It reaches a maximum brightness of 2,600 nits, making it great for outdoor use, yet it can dim to low levels at night without the banding issues found in some other devices. The display is pushed right to the edges, featuring some of the thinnest bezels we’ve seen. Plus, there’s a new anti-reflective coating on the Gorilla Glass Armor, which makes a noticeable difference in certain lighting conditions.

To top it off, there’s an incredibly fast ultrasonic fingerprint reader underneath. If I had to nitpick, I’d wish the touch target was a bit larger, but that’s about it. Honestly, if display quality is crucial to you, this is the phone to get.

Now, what if battery life is your primary concern? While you could consider an Energizer phone, this device features a 5,000mAh battery and remains one of the best-performing phones in that regard over the past two years. It manages to stay thinner while still accommodating the S Pen. The device supports 45-watt wired charging and 25-watt wireless charging. I experienced long usage days with over six hours of screen time, and I even managed to stretch it to two full days with 1440p at 120Hz and high brightness. So really, why look elsewhere?

Now, if performance is what you care about most, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is making its way into many phones, and it looks fantastic. The S24 Ultra pairs this with 12GB of RAM, excelling in multitasking. If you’re interested in using a stylus, the S Pen is the only high-end stylus available in slab smartphones, making it an excellent tool for note-taking, drawing, and highlighting. If stylus use isn’t your thing, you can still enjoy stellar everyday and gaming performance, as it features newly added ray tracing and a 90% larger vapor chamber for extended cooling.

You could opt for a gaming phone to squeeze out more frames from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 with advanced cooling systems, but that would require accepting sacrifices typical of gaming phones. Whether you need those extra frames is subjective.

Regarding cameras, there are plenty of great options out there for your $1,300. The Pixel just won a blind camera test, and Sony offers the best manual mode. However, when evaluating smartphone cameras, there are two approaches: the utility of specs and the subjective aesthetics. Utility-wise, this camera setup checks every box. It features four cameras on the back, mainly building on last year’s S23 Ultra. The primary camera remains a remarkable 200-megapixel sensor, delivering consistent, versatile performance with great dynamic range and quick autofocus, and it typically outputs 12-megapixel photos unless exceptional lighting is present.

The ultra-wide camera has some distortion at the edges but is wider than the primary, making it fun to shoot with. Just be sure to turn off the auto macro mode, as it tends to produce poor-quality images. The S24 Ultra also introduces a new 50-megapixel 5X telephoto camera, enhancing resolution and image quality in that zoom range, while still allowing for 10X zoom and ultra-stable shots of distant objects, like the moon.

In terms of utility, this camera system does everything you'd want, but there's also a subjective aspect to consider. Samsung’s processing style tends to be slightly more vibrant and contrasty than competitors'. If you want to check every feature box without compromise, this phone does just that. 

Additionally, the S24 Ultra captures images in HDR format by default, similar to what the Pixel and iPhone do. It ensures that specular highlights and dynamic range differences are well-managed across capturing, viewing, and sharing, especially supported by a partnership with platforms like Instagram and Snapchat.

If software features are paramount, this phone now incorporates numerous helpful AI functionalities that enhance everyday use. Many of these features have been developed in partnership with Google, which is interesting—Samsung needs Google to maintain competitiveness, especially against the iPhone, while Google benefits from this collaboration as well.

Once you open a photo in Samsung’s Gallery app, you can access various AI-driven enhancements, like remastering, erasing reflections, and even applying background blur to non-portrait images based on detected subjects. There’s also a separate Magic Editor that allows for extensive editing, such as moving subjects or removing unwanted items from photos without cropping.

The AI features are organized under "Advanced Intelligence," which includes functions like live call translation, improved voice recording capabilities, and webpage summaries. One particularly impressive feature is Circle to Search, allowing you to quickly search anything on your screen by simply circling it, resulting in rapid responses without leaving your current app.

Samsung now promises seven years of security updates and seven generations of major software updates for this phone line, effectively ensuring the S24 Ultra remains relevant through 2031.

In the past, if you wanted longevity in software updates or the best features, it meant going for an iPhone or Pixel. However, with these new offerings, choosing the S24 Ultra becomes a compelling option.

Looking at how the S24 Ultra compares with the iPhone, Samsung is clearly pulling elements from Apple’s design, from the new titanium colors to the flatter screens and boxier corners. They've also added an always-on display that shows your wallpaper, reminiscent of Apple's design.

Despite being a $1,300 phone, if you want everything stuffed into one device, this is the one to get. It delivers reliability, speed, and a comprehensive feature set.
