Hey guys, Google had an event today where they completely surprised us by announcing the totally unexpected Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, along with the Pixel Watch that somehow never leaked. It completely caught us off guard. I hope you can sense my sarcasm through the internet, but hey, I dig an event, and it has some stuff that I was really looking forward to—mostly the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro—because I've been a Pixel fan. Even though I know it has big flaws, like the Tensor G2's subpar performance and somewhat average battery life, I still like the Pixel, and there's a lot I was looking forward to in the next iteration.

They delivered on a lot of that but it also comes with a new price. So, on the outside, the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro still look like Pixels, right? I told you they were sticking with this design language with the visor because it’s very recognizable, and they've finally got that going for them. This year, though, it feels like they rounded everything off—that's the big visible design update; everything's a bit more rounded. And then there are the new colors. Honestly, I think it’s been a pretty boring year for phone colors across the board, just putting it out there. 

For the Pixel 8, there's Hazel, Rose, and Obsidian, and for the Pixel 8 Pro, there's Obsidian, Porcelain, and a new blue color called Bay. I think the blue is probably the most interesting of the whole lineup, especially with the new matte finish on the back of all the Pros. I love that; it might be my favorite alongside Matte Black—maybe it’s a toss-up between the two. 

Around the front, both displays have actually improved. The bezels are a bit thinner and look pretty uniform all the way around. They’re also dramatically brighter—up to 2,000 nits peak brightness on the Pixel 8 and 2,400 nits on the 8 Pro. I think that’s the highest brightness I’ve ever seen in a phone, so it should look really good both indoors and outdoors. Plus, the smaller Pixel 8 is now at 120 Hz as well. I love that. I know people love to dismiss 120 Hz on cheaper phones, but we’re there now. 

It’s not LTPO yet; that’s still just for the Pro. But yeah, just looking at these screens for the limited time I spent with them, I’m very excited to see how they perform in the real world. They’re calling it an "Actua Display" and a "Super Actua Display." Not sure why, but I guess you have to name everything.

Anyway, this year, the really big physical change we’re getting with these phones is the new Tensor G3 chip. It’s the third generation of Google Silicon, paired with eight gigs of RAM on the Pixel 8 and 12 gigs of RAM on the Pixel 8 Pro. To be honest, Google didn’t really talk much about raw performance improvements, like CPU and GPU; it’s not really about that. I’ll have to test these phones to see if they actually improve a lot in overall power. Definitely get subscribed to be the first to see those reviews when they come out.

The new batteries in these phones are slightly bigger than last year. But really, the story with the Tensor G3 is that there’s way more TPU and processing power for AI-related tasks. That checks out because the Pixel story has always been about the software, and that’s still very true with these. The Pixel is basically the smartest smartphone in the room. It’s not going to wow you with amazing numbers or incredible build quality; it’s going to impress you with clever software at every corner.

So, we’re talking about a new Google Assistant feature where, if you’re on a webpage in Chrome, you can ask the Assistant to summarize the webpage for you. Using the same tech from Google Bard, it’ll quickly provide you with a three or four bullet-point summary, hopefully accurate. Speech-to-text is also now even faster and more accurate. It’s completely on-device and does a much better job at recognizing that "ums" and "uhs" are not part of your actual sentence, so it doesn’t write them down—that’s smart.

They’re also doing more with the front-facing camera to make features like face unlock and unlocking apps more secure. There’s even a new fix-it feature that proofreads your messages built into the keyboard before you send them, checking for things like grammar and more. One of the standout features is the new call screen voice. If you’ve used a Pixel before, you know about call screening; when you get a call from an unknown number, you let the Google Assistant screen it. The new one has a much more human voice that sounds either like a very advanced robot or a recording of an actual person. 

It’s much more human-sounding, and it has context-aware responses now. For example, if it listens to someone say, "Hey, I’m a UPS driver," you can hit a button that automatically responds, "Oh, you can leave the package at the doorstep." I recorded this so you can hear it:

- [Google Assistant] Hi, I’m a Google Virtual Calling Assistant recording this call on behalf of the person you’re trying to reach. Can you say what you’re calling about?
- [Courier] I’m trying to drop off a package for Kenny.
(no audio)
- [Google Assistant] They said you can go ahead and leave the package by the front door.
(no audio)
- [Courier] Okay, thanks. That’s great.
(no audio)
- [Google Assistant] Great, I’ll see you soon.
(beeps)

So yeah, that sounds pretty good to me. It sounds very human, but again, I don’t know; it could just literally be a human recording. Either way, it’s a virtual assistant. But what would a Pixel be without some camera magic? Let’s jump into the new camera features with the Pixel because there's a lot of software magic going on here.

The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro now share the same upgraded 50-megapixel main camera system. The 8 also has a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, but the 8 Pro takes it up a notch with a 48-megapixel ultra-wide and a 48-megapixel 5x telephoto lens. I also really like the new camera app layout, which is now basically separated into photo and video modes, with various settings and modes housed inside each. I think it makes intuitive sense—you can switch to photo mode and then choose a specific photo mode. 

There are manual controls, too. It’s not the first time I’ve seen it laid out this way, but when you have so much happening in the camera, you don’t want to hide or move features; you just need to organize them effectively. I think this layout does a good job. 

I’ll have to save my photo and video quality analysis for the full review, but there are lots of new software features that seem to push the boundaries. One standout is the Magic Editor. You’ve probably seen the Magic Eraser, which can erase people from the background of photos, but now Magic Editor lets you select subjects and move them around, altering the entire photo with just a few taps. They showed me an example of moving a subject in a beach photo, but there are other demos of changing the sky, shadows, and more. Honestly, it seems nothing is off-limits.

There’s also a feature I didn’t get footage of called Best Take. It’s for taking a group photo—you know how you always have someone blinking in the picture? Google detects that you’re taking a burst photo and lets you tap on the people’s faces to swap them with different instances from other photos, creating a composite image where everyone looks perfect, even though that moment never happened. What is a photo, right? (laughs)

Then there’s another feature called Audio Eraser, a video editing tool exclusive to the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro but usable on any video in your library. It erases background sounds from videos featuring a subject, and it supposedly works really well. The demo they showed me worked incredibly well. 

All of this is along the theme of awesome software magic enabled by the Tensor G3. The neural cores and processing powers are what make all this fancy software possible. There are also two other features that didn’t fit into the rest of this video. One is a new hole on the back of the Pro phone, which is a temperature sensor. Yes, really. 

There’s a new thermometer app that asks you to select a material to measure the surface temperature for accuracy. You pick your material, get close, and tap to measure. It works, and it's pretty neat. I don’t know how often I'd use this, but you may notice that humans are absent from the object selection menu, as measuring human temperature is still awaiting FDA approval. Maybe that’ll be added once it gets approved later this year. 

Also, the haptics are amazing! I noticed this right away when typing on the 8 Pro; the haptics are much stronger and more refined. There's a difference between just strong haptics and clean, refined haptics, and this has both. I think that’s super underrated. I don’t know if they’ll mention this in marketing materials, but I loved the haptics during my time with this phone. 

Quick interjection: One more thing I wanted to mention is called Video Boost. It's one of the weirdest features; it's only available on the Pro Pixel and doesn’t launch with the phone—it’ll come later. The idea is that you take a video on your Pixel, and it looks okay at first. Then you upload it to the cloud, where it processes overnight or after a few hours and returns a dramatically better version—better HDR, improved color grading, making the video look much better than the original. I’m not sure why it’s limited to the Pro phone or why it uploads to servers, but it’s just this weird video magic feature called Video Boost. We’ll see what happens when it rolls out.

Now, the new prices: the Pixel 8 is starting at $699, which is $100 more than last year, and the Pixel 8 Pro will start at $999. I think you can justify it, though. The base Pixel just got upgraded to a 120 Hz display with a much brighter screen and thinner bezels, and it features the Tensor G3 along with a primary camera similar to that in the more expensive model. I still feel like that’s a fair price, even if it’s not the bargain of the year like before. 

Another great update for both devices is they’re offering seven years of OS security and feature updates. Seven years! It’s impressive and something they probably should have been doing from the start with Google’s own phone running Google’s software. Just think about that—this phone will get its last software update in 2030. Good job, Google! 

They also announced an update to the Pixel Watch 2. It maintains the same sleek pebble design, but now it has a new quad-core processor for significant speed improvements and potentially longer battery life. They’re promising 24 hours with the always-on display. There are newly redesigned apps like Gmail and Calendar. 

They’ve added several features that resemble those recently announced for the Apple Watch. There’s a new safety check feature that works almost exactly like Apple’s. They’ve also added a skin temperature sensor for monitoring patterns, along with auto workout start and stop detection, and backup and restore features that should have been available ages ago but now have been added.

Looking at the back of the Watch, there are improved sensors for better heart rate and health data monitoring during vigorous activity. This watch will launch at the same price as last year—$349 for the Wi-Fi only model and $399 for the LTE version. 

And that brings us to the sponsor of this video, the Dbrand Ghost Case. They’re making one for the new Pixels—the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro—allowing you to showcase that matte finish or new color through the case while keeping it protected. Even though it doesn't have G2 wireless charging like it was rumored to, that hasn’t stopped Dbrand from adding a MagSafe compatible ring on the back. I also like the unique question mark design compared to the classic Apple MagSafe layout. Dbrand claims the Ghost Case will never turn yellow, unlike other clear cases. If you want to pick up a Ghost Case, I’ll leave a link below.

That’s it for now. Let me know what you guys want to see in the reviews of these devices—the phones and the watch—because my name is Marques Brownlee, and it is officially Techtober. There will be a bunch of videos over the next couple of weeks, so stay tuned and get subscribed. Catch you in the next one. Peace.
