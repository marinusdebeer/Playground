So this smartwatch has one really interesting trick up its sleeve that I haven’t seen in any other, and honestly, I don't think we’re ever going to see again. At this point, we know what a smartwatch is, right? This is a stable, mature category. They deliver mostly across the board on all the same functions, and aside from the one crazy trick, this one is no exception. 

This is the OnePlus Watch 2, three years after the original OnePlus Watch, and it costs 300 bucks. For the $300 you're spending, you're getting a pretty nice circular watch design. It comes in a black or silver stainless steel body with a sapphire cover glass over a 1.4-inch, 60 Hz AMOLED display. 

Design-wise, you could argue it takes cues from maybe the OnePlus 11 or the OnePlus 12, particularly in the way the camera bump is integrated into the side rail of the phone. They've done a similar thing here with the buttons on the side of the watch. There's a circular button at the top and a rectangular button at the bottom. I kind of like it; it’s a nice shape, offering a subtle, classy variation from the pure circle.

The back looks pretty standard too, with four pins at the top for charging and all the sensors you’d expect: an optical heart rate sensor, a pulse oximeter for blood oxygen, and of course, interchangeable bands, just like the first generation. The whole thing is both IP68 dust and water-resistant and meets a US military standard for durability, meaning it can withstand extreme temperatures, moisture, and shock among other things.

It’s not too heavy; it’s built pretty well. This display goes up to a thousand nits peak brightness, which looks great. So what’s the catch? What’s the weird twist? Well, I mentioned that we already kind of know what a smartwatch is—a tiny computer on your wrist with a tiny screen and a tiny battery. And that’s fine; they all tend to have pretty short battery lives because they’re so small, so you typically charge them every day. 

The main competitors here are the Apple Watch, which claims 18 hours, though that may not be the most direct comparison since that’s connected with the iPhone; then you have the Galaxy Watch, one of the best, which offers 40 hours of battery life, and the Pixel Watch, the newest one, with 24 hours. But this OnePlus watch is claiming 100 hours—100-hour battery life in Smart Mode, which is not a battery-saving mode; it's actually the default setting out of the box. 

100 hours. So 96 hours is four days. I feel like 100 sounds cooler, so they just went with that. But four days of battery life sounds a lot less inconvenient. So I had to put that to the test. For the past four straight days, I've been that guy walking around with both an Apple Watch Ultra, which claims 36 hours of normal use, and this OnePlus Watch, doing all the same tasks: getting notifications, working out, and just exploring the UI.

By the end, I was actually very impressed with both. The $800 Apple Watch Ultra performed beyond the 36 hours it claimed; by hour 56, it was about ready to die. Meanwhile, the OnePlus Watch had about 15% battery left. You’re probably thinking, wait, that’s not even close to 100; it’s around 50 something. But OnePlus told me that if you turn the always-on display off, that’s good for two more days of battery life—it’s actually off by default. 

I turned it on for this test, but that would get you well over the 100-hour mark. To be fair, that’s probably true for the Apple Watch Ultra too. A detail to consider that mattered for this test: I’ve been wearing hoodies a lot because of the weather, and with the sleeves covering the watch, it thinks it’s in the dark. The light sensors are blocked, so it turns the brightness way down on the watch. I think that’s why it outperformed its claimed battery numbers, as I had a sleeve over it a lot of the time. 

But even still, this $300 watch outperformed the $800 smartwatch in terms of battery life. Now here’s the twist. The way they’re achieving this battery life is even more interesting than the battery life itself. Most smartwatches have a chip inside that computes everything with some high-powered cores and some high-efficiency cores to balance power and battery life. This watch has two entirely separate processors and two different operating systems running for each of them. 

There’s a high-powered Snapdragon W5 inside that powers Wear OS 4, which only activates for tasks requiring it. Then there’s also a BES 2700 chip that is always on and runs RTOS. They share the same 32 GB of base storage and 2 GB of RAM. Wear OS kicks in for more intensive tasks like maps or music playback, while the always-on RTOS manages basic, low-power functions: heart rate monitoring, phone calls, notifications, and background tasks. It’s like a hybrid car; really interesting. 

In a fully electric car, you get the benefits of being responsive but not the best range. A gas car has a lot of range but isn't as responsive as fully electric. If you get a hybrid, you get the best of both worlds: responsiveness and range. This watch acts as a hybrid, combining responsiveness and battery longevity.

I’ve been impressed using this; it’s responsive and offers a ton of watch faces. There are many custom workouts that feel very familiar and track everything, sending all the data to the OHealth app in detail. I do wish that shoveling snow was a workout type, but that’s another story. These are regular weightlifting workouts. Also, I really like that you hold to end the workout, rather than tapping; it's much harder to accidentally stop a workout. 

However, there’s a weird quirk: this button has a crown that rotates, but it doesn’t actually do anything—it doesn’t change the volume or scroll; it just spins freely. Apparently, that’s literally just for durability upon impact, serving no functional purpose. 

Another hitch I’ve noticed is the delay when checking notifications. I feel the buzz on my wrist, lift it up, and it takes about two seconds to show me the notification. Not that two seconds is a disaster, but it’s longer than expected, and it annoys me to wait compared to other watches that show notifications immediately. 

You can see the moment the Snapdragon W5 fires up and Wear OS snaps on before displaying the notification. It’s very odd. Here’s the other twist: I don’t think this dual-chip system is the only factor behind this impressive battery life because this watch also has a 500 mAh battery. 

Now, 500 mAh doesn’t sound like a lot, but when compared to other smartwatches in this category, it’s a bit bigger than you’d expect. If I gave the Pixel Watch 2—which also has a Snapdragon W5—a 500 mAh battery, do we think it would last 50 hours? I don’t know, but there you go. 

Honestly, at the end of the day, I’m truly impressed that they managed to keep the price of this watch so low. Two chips, two OSs, and the effort that goes into that seem expensive, and it’s really not lacking anything too drastic. I think it’s competitive in many good ways at 300 bucks. 

The clear positives include a nice design, a classy look, a high-quality display, dual-frequency GPS for better accuracy, and impressive battery life. The four days we talked about is awesome, but if you activate power saver mode, it can last up to 12 days, although that disables a lot of Wear OS features—just basic tasks like exercises and heart rate monitoring. You could still make it last a week if you wanted to. 

However, the weaknesses are the delay in checking notifications, the not-so-great haptics, and the lack of iPhone compatibility, which you already knew. I’d also add that the charger is not that impressive. It’s kind of clunky—a big plastic block with pins and magnets—but it charges perfectly fine. You can get a full day’s charge in 10 minutes and a complete charge in an hour. That's acceptable. 

For $300, I’d say OnePlus has redeemed itself in its smartwatch efforts. It’s pretty good. In a world of smartwatch gimmicks—there's the one with earbuds inside, the one focused on fitness, the one designed for iPhone—maybe this is the one with the hybrid system and solid battery life.

Maybe that’s enough for you. Let me know in the comments below. Regardless, that’s been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.
