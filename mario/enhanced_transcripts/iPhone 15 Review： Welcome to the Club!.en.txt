All right, so this is Apple's brand new, latest and greatest iPhone 15. Nothing inside is new or anything we haven’t seen before in some other phone. That doesn’t mean it's not a good phone; you can have a really good phone without it being particularly new—they aren't mutually exclusive. It turns out that is actually Apple's strategy with this device. The more I use this phone, the more I recognize Apple’s textbook late mover advantage strategy at play. They’re taking something we've literally already seen and doing it the Apple way.

On the outside, how would I describe this phone’s design? Kind of familiar, somewhat reminiscent of the 14. How does Apple describe it? 

- "The iPhone 15 has an all-new design that’s simply gorgeous."

All new? Really? I’m not sure about "all new," but this phone definitely inherits the same look and general design as last year’s model. However, what's at least partially new is the way it feels in the hand. As I mentioned in the 15 Pro review, they've done a good job softening the corners. It still looks boxy and has aluminum rails, but it’s more comfortable to hold since the corners aren't as sharp; they're a bit rounded. 

This is also the first glass-backed non-Pro iPhone with a satin back, and I am loving it. It has a nice, soft touch with frosted glass. There’s a super complicated process to get this single piece of glass on the back to be two different colors and thicknesses, and I can totally respect that. But honestly, the colors are super weak. People were commenting in the last video that the color grading must be off because it looks white instead of blue. No, this blue phone really doesn’t appear very blue at all in almost any lighting; it’s like 1% blue.

But either way, you can say that between the aluminum frame and the pale light colors, these are probably the most fingerprint-resistant iPhones in years. On the sides, you’ll find the same button placements, speaker placements, and mute switch; there’s no action button on this phone. Honestly, you could probably use an iPhone 14 case on the iPhone 15.

Moving to the front, there's a new screen—well, not new, but new to this iPhone. You now get the Dynamic Island on the non-Pro iPhones this year, which is doing the punch-hole cutout the Apple way. The notch is finally dead—until maybe a new iPhone SE brings it back; it could happen. Slowly but surely, app developers have been getting on board in useful ways over the past year. I have a few favorites now, like my airline app giving me real-time flight info, along with weather apps, Uber, etc.

While we’re discussing the screen, it’s also brighter—up to 2,000 nits now, which looks awesome outdoors. But it’s 2023, and this is an $800 phone that still has a 60 hertz display. This is quite fascinating to me. On one hand, for most people buying this phone, it’s totally fine. It’s a new baseline iPhone. Have you talked to someone who buys a new baseline iPhone? They literally don’t care. It doesn’t matter; it’s not something they pay attention to. You could ask them right now how many frames per second their phone runs at, and they wouldn’t have an answer.

As long as it works and operates relatively smoothly—like last year and the year before—it’s a non-factor. I’ve literally handed a 120 hertz phone to people next to a 60 hertz phone, and even side by side, they can’t see the difference. If they do, it's just a subtle thing that seems kind of neat, but they’d be totally fine missing out on it.

Given the target demographic of this phone, it's completely acceptable. But on the other hand, Apple, the richest technology company in the world, often adds subtle improvements or changes that regular people will literally never notice. Like, when they switched these baseline iPhones from LCD to OLED displays, do you think anyone actually noticed? Or when they moved from the A15 Bionic last year to the A16 Bionic? Do you think people noticed the differences? What about when they added 5G to the iPhone, and most people didn’t care? Making subtle improvements over time is what modern smartphones are all about these days.

I would argue that a higher refresh rate is more noticeable to more people than some of those other things. I think you could hand me, a professional, an unlabeled iPhone with an A15 and an A16 Bionic chip, and it would take time to find the real differences between them. Given how easy and reasonable it would be to at least incorporate a 90 hertz display—didn’t the new Moto G come out with a 90 hertz display for like $170? I'm sure that’s a horrible looking screen compared to this iPhone, but still, they decided to add that to that phone because Motorola knew enough people would notice it and feel that smoothness difference.

It’s wild to me knowing how easy it would be for Apple to make this at least a 90 hertz display, yet they refuse to do it because they’ve attached the word "Pro" to that feature. Promotion for the Pro phones. It strikes me as a strategy to widen the gap as much as possible between the Pro iPhones and the non-Pro iPhones. And they’re happy to do it, even if it makes this iPhone 15 the most expensive phone in the world with a 60 hertz display.

Speaking of widening that gap, the Pro phones this year also got a brand new A17 Pro chip, while the iPhone 15 retains last year’s A16 Bionic from the 14 Pro. Honestly, the renaming of the Pro chip might be the most intriguing aspect since it implies it’s definitely not going to trickle down to the baseline phone next year. But this A16 Bionic is more than adequate in a phone of this price in terms of performance, handling everyday tasks, gaming, and flying around iOS at 60 hertz.

You could argue for a 60 hertz display in terms of battery life because, despite concerns, the battery life on these phones has been quite good. Apple has officially addressed the heat and battery issues some people, including myself, reported with these iPhones. An iOS update is on the way, and it seems some specific third-party apps, like Instagram, were also having issues that should be getting updates too. On average, the battery life on my iPhone 15 has been better than that of the 15 Pro. The 15 Plus looks to have the best battery life ever on any iPhone, which is really promising.

So, the combination of the A16 Bionic, which isn’t new, and the 60 hertz screens, which are also not new, is resulting in great battery life. USB-C is not new, but here it is, along with all the benefits: using the same cable to charge everything and plugging into various accessories like monitors and keyboards. It's unfortunate that the older chip means there’s no USB 3 controller, so you won’t get USB 3 data speeds; it’s still slow. However, unless you’re using the Pro iPhone’s camera features, almost nobody buying this phone is going to need fast data transfer, so it’s a pass.

And they’ve managed to do it the Apple way. They matched the inside of the USB-C port with the color of the phone, and they actually print the model number inside the port. Apple loves hiding this in the most discreet way possible. 

I really appreciate some clever software features on the iPhone 15 because you could actually consider them new. They added an ultra-wideband chip so you can find your phone more easily with an Apple Watch or through the Find My app. They also introduced clever audio and video effects at the OS level, so they work in any app. You can be on a phone call or a video call (Google Meet, Zoom, etc.) and activate background noise cancellation, which impressively picks out your voice while minimizing background noise.

For example, during a phone call, here’s what it sounds like with a dishwasher running, HVAC going, and a sink running next to me. When switching the mic from Standard mode to Voice Isolation mode, even with the background noise still happening, it does a much better job of picking out just my voice. It’s really smart and genuinely new.

There are also other not-so-new features, like the addition of downloadable offline areas in Apple Maps and interactable widgets. They’ve also finally added an 80% battery charge limiter in the settings. If you're interested, I did a full video on the iOS 17 update; check out the link below if you want to see that after watching this.

One of the most popular features I mentioned in that video is Standby mode. On the Pro iPhones, when placed on a charger sideways, it keeps the screen on because it drops to one hertz due to its LTPO display, which can stay on like that. But on the non-Pro iPhone, which doesn’t have LTPO, it’s basically locked at either 30 or 60 hertz. Apple just decides to turn off the screen after a little while, which defeats the purpose, so you have to nudge the table or tap the stand to wake it up, similar to an Apple Watch charger. Just a notable difference between the Pro and non-Pro iPhones.

Last but not least, the new cameras are, in an odd way, quite good. The iPhone 15 has been upgraded to a new set of 12 megapixel ultra-wide and a new 48 megapixel main camera. It’s not the same sensor as the Pro; it’s actually slightly smaller but has a larger max aperture of f/1.6 to compensate. It utilizes a combination of binning and detailed transfer to give you a new 24 megapixel photo by default. 

If you’ve been paying attention, you’ll note that this new iPhone has the same chip as last year’s Pro iPhone, with the same processing cores, image signal processor, neural engine, and A16 Bionic. So, why is this new 24 megapixel default only available on the iPhone 15 and not last year’s Pro? My last year’s Pro phone has the latest software but doesn’t get this feature; it’s still shooting 12 megapixels. 

Surprisingly, my base iPhone 15’s non-zoomed photos are looking a little better and more detailed than last year’s Pro photos. Then there’s the new auto-Portrait mode detection feature, which is pretty sweet. You don’t have to switch to Portrait Mode to take a photo that captures all the depth information to turn it into a portrait later. As long as you’re pointing the camera at a human subject or animal identified by the neural engine, or if you tap to focus, you’ll automatically see a little “F” at the bottom corner of the screen, indicating it’s capturing data for Portrait Mode.

Later, if you decide you want it as a Portrait Mode shot, you can go into your gallery and make it a Portrait Mode photo, which you can further edit. Some have described it as being able to change the focus point later. It's not exactly that; you can’t restore something that was out of focus. But for the classic iPhone shot, where it looks like everything is in focus, you can use the Portrait Mode feature to achieve great results.

Last year’s Pro iPhone also has the same chip, a 48 megapixel main camera, and the same neural engine, yet doesn’t get this feature for some reason. It’s certainly odd.

With these reviews, we often judge what we think the typical iPhone buyer cares about and what they’ll notice or appreciate in a new phone. With this one, I feel they’ve stacked enough subtle improvements that even though it looks the same and there’s not much that’s actually new, it feels like a noticeably better phone.

My verdict is that if you have an iPhone 14, you don’t need to upgrade, not even from a 13. But if you have an older phone and you’re looking to upgrade, every year I get friends asking, “Should I just get the older, last year’s iPhone to save some money?” My answer is no. I would suggest getting the iPhone 15. There are enough new changes to qualify it as a better phone in every way, and it’s also USB-C compliant. 

You don’t buy a base iPhone to get the bleeding edge of technology; you buy it because it works, it feels familiar, and will serve you well for the next few years. Since you’ll have it for the upcoming years, I would not recommend buying a Lightning iPhone now that everything has shifted to USB-C. Just get the new one—go for the "boring" new iPhone that has nothing that’s actually groundbreaking. It’s simply going to work.

That’s it! Thanks for watching, and catch you in the next one. Peace.
