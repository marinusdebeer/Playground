A couple of days ago, I posted a Twitter thread—yes, I still call it Twitter—and I severely underestimated how many of you would find it interesting. The conversation it sparked was really engaging, and the discussions afterward were fun to participate in. So, I decided to share even more footage from my visit to Apple's secret iPhone durability testing labs.

If you’ve ever wondered how an iPhone undergoes water resistance testing, drop testing, or rigorous shaking before it gets announced on stage, these are the labs where that all happens. It’s fascinating how they connect the dots between test results and smartphone construction.

The first thing I experienced was the water resistance testing. Most of us take for granted that high-end smartphones, especially flagship models, typically have IP68 ratings. However, many don’t realize that IP is a code, where "IP" stands for ingress protection. The first number relates to solids, and the second to liquids. Each of these numbers increases as protection against ingress improves. For instance, earbuds or headphones may have an IPX4 rating, which means they aren’t dust-proof but can withstand light splashes from any direction—great for sweat.

The first iPhones, up to the iPhone 6s, weren’t rated for water resistance. The first water-resistant iPhone was the iPhone 7, which had an IP67 rating. Now, we see everything rated at IP68, meaning it can be submerged underwater for an extended period. This is what the testing looks like: there is specialized equipment to torture phones with water to ensure they can survive.

Many companies have similar setups, but it was cool to witness it firsthand. The lowest level of the test simulates rain and splashing with a drip ceiling, requiring no real water pressure, passing for IPX4. To simulate water pressure, jets rotate around the device and spray it from all angles, including the speakers, earpiece, and ports. Passing this test earns an IPX5 rating. 

To ramp it up, they place the phone on one end and blast it with high-pressure water from a literal fire hose on the other end. It looks insane! Yet, if we want our modern smartphones to endure splashes at various angles multiple times over their lifespan, they must pass this test to achieve the IPX6 rating. Finally, for IPX7 and IPX8, which involve full submersion, they use lockable sealed tanks. IPX8 requires the device to withstand deep water for an extended time. They even have a pressurized tank to simulate different water depths, leaving phones submerged for as long as needed.

Ideally, if you drop your phone in a toilet, spill water on it, or drop it in a lake, it should survive. We often take this for granted, but the seals, gaskets, and adhesives required for these tests are what allow them to perform in real-world scenarios.

There’s a whole separate type of testing you might have already seen on YouTube—drop testing. Apple has been conducting its own internal drop testing for years. In the same building, they set up an industrial robot by Epson programmed to perform drop tests in front of ultra-bright lights and super high-speed Phantom cameras focused on the exact spot where the phone will land. 

The robot can pick up the phone and drop it onto any surface repeatedly. They can also vary the surfaces for A/B testing to analyze the results. For those of you into cameras, you’ll know these Phantom cameras can shoot at impressive frame rates. I didn’t catch the exact rate during my visit, but it was fascinating to see the titanium on the iPhone 15 Pro wobble on its first and second impacts with the ground. 

They tested all kinds of surfaces—from granite countertops to marble to wood. They even had a massive block of asphalt to see how the iPhone fares when dropped on the street. This was an impressive setup. However, it raises the question: how much of this data translates into real changes in phone design? Most phones still break upon impact.

Another challenging test to capture was the shaking tests. Apple has machines designed with trays of devices strapped to a surface shaken thousands of times at specific frequencies. Recording this is tricky because if the shutter speed is just right, it looks like nothing is moving—similar to how car wheels appear stationary on camera. However, I managed to capture some clips where you can see the shaking in action.

These machines simulate years of wear and tear in the real world. Apple can program in the frequency of various engines or vibrations (like those from a motorcycle, car, or subway) to ensure durability over extended exposure.

The most fascinating part of this testing process is that Apple aims to simulate years of wear and tear before the phone even hits the market, using specialized machines designed for this purpose. I spoke with John Ternus, head of hardware engineering at Apple, who mentioned they sometimes go through around 10,000 iPhone prototypes to finalize a design after all this durability testing. That sounds incredible! 

I took this unique opportunity to ask John about the dual concepts of durability and repairability. Apple has a reputation for being not great at repairability—the iPhone is notoriously difficult to fix. Yet, the more I think about it, durability seems to be at odds with repairability. It feels like there’s a sliding scale between the two: as you increase durability, the repairability decreases.

Here’s a snippet of our conversation on this topic:

- "Sometimes, for me, I find it helpful to think about the bookends. Imagine a product that never fails, at one end, and at the other, a product that's super easy to repair but not very reliable."  
- "Right."  
- "A product that never fails is better for the customer and the environment."  
- "Interesting to view it that way. On one end, you have the product that never fails, and on the other, a product that can be infinitely repaired but isn't reliable."  
- "Sure, but they aren't always mutually exclusive. Those represent the extremes. For example, take the battery on an iPhone. A battery needs to be replaced over time to extend the product's life."  

In the early days, the primary failure type was water ingress from dropping the phone in water or spilling a drink on it. They've made significant strides to minimize such failures, achieving an impressive IP68 rating. Customers often share stories about dropping their phones in lakes and having them still work.

However, to achieve this impressive reliability, a lot of seals, adhesives, and materials must be designed, complicating battery repairs. They do have solutions for customers who need battery replacements, but ultimately, greater reliability benefits consumers and the environment by reducing failure rates and repair needs.

It’s intriguing to hear Apple speak directly on this. Ideally, if Apple aims to create the ultimate phone that never breaks, they probably shouldn't use glass because, as JerryRigEverything says, "glass is glass" and breaks. Still, they aim to push towards that ideal. 

That’s my behind-the-scenes look at Apple’s durability testing labs that we’ve never seen before. Make sure to subscribe for more exciting content like this, and let me know your thoughts on the trade-off between durability and repairability. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.
