All right, so the Tesla Cybertruck has been somewhat of an enigma. It was revealed nearly four years ago, and since then, it was relatively quiet. However, we gradually started seeing prototype Cybertrucks rolling around California and a few in Texas for testing. Interestingly, I had the opportunity to test one for a day. 

What we have here is a near-final version of the Tesla Cybertruck. It’s not a delivery-ready truck yet; it’s still in the testing phase. There are some minor prototyping elements still present, but everything I’m about to show you will be included in the customer delivery trucks starting now. 

During my time testing it, I've learned a lot about this truck. There are some surprising features that I think truck enthusiasts will really appreciate, but there are also a few concerns and surprises. Buckle up—this is going to be a comprehensive video. Make sure to subscribe; there’s a lot to cover. Let’s take a look at the Tesla Cybertruck.

First, let's get into the specs. Everyone wants to know the official numbers, the details on paper. Interestingly, some specifications have changed from the show truck that appeared on stage, including overall dimensions, which I’ll discuss shortly. 

The important details you probably care about are the basics: price, range, and speed. There will be three configurations of the Cybertruck. The version we’re looking at here is the triple motor version. It’s not quite the same as the Plaid powertrain, but it has two motors in the rear and one in the front. This setup allows it to go from zero to 60 mph in 2.7 seconds and complete a quarter-mile in 11 seconds. It boasts around 845 horsepower, features torque vectoring at the rear, and is often referred to as "the beast." It’s a pretty ridiculous set of specs, making it the fastest production pickup truck currently available. 

There will also be a dual motor version that will start shipping soon, followed by a single motor rear-wheel drive version. The starting price for the triple motor variant is about $100,000, which is new information; we originally anticipated a lower launch price. Expect around $75,000 to $85,000 for the dual motor version, while the single motor will come later. The dual motor still offers over 600 horsepower, so it’s plenty fast.

As for the range, we’ll touch on the wheels shortly, but you can expect about a 340-mile maximum range for the most efficient version of the truck. 

A couple of other noteworthy numbers that truck enthusiasts might appreciate are towing and bed capacities. Tesla has communicated some of these: the tow capacity is around 2,500 pounds, which is impressive. We found that the vehicle is officially about 5% smaller in every dimension compared to the original prototype shown on stage. For instance, the overall length from bumper to bumper is about 224 inches. 

We also have an F-150 Lightning here for direct comparison. This truck is roughly the same size as the F-150 Lightning—just a little smaller. Speaking of the 5% decrease in dimensions, several aspects of this truck have changed since the original show car, including a motorized front trunk and various other features. 

One standout feature is the world’s largest windshield wiper, which I’m sure you’re curious about. The truck does indeed have removable side view mirrors. While it has to ship with these mirrors due to regulations, they can be taken off by users. There are also blind spot monitoring lights inside the truck, with cameras on the sides to give you a clear view of blind spots when signaling. 

These wheels feature removable aero caps. Starting with the premium tire on a 20-inch rim, this bespoke Goodyear tire has unique aesthetic and functional tweaks. The arrow cap is designed to improve range by a few percentage points, but if you’re not keen on the look or plan to go off-roading, you can easily remove it. 

Removing these arrow caps reveals a practical stock tire design. This two-piece structure is designed for functionality while also enhancing the truck's range. 

You can’t really talk about the Cybertruck without mentioning its unique design. It’s essentially a giant stainless steel triangle. There aren’t any significant curves on the truck; everything is made from large, flat pieces of stainless steel which gives it a distinctive aesthetic. However, this sharpness also leads to some edging concerns if you’re not careful around the sharp corners.

I've looked at several Cybertrucks, and each one seems to have varying levels of build quality and panel gaps. The truck we’re examining here looks pretty great overall with generally even panel gaps. However, I can’t promise that every truck will match this level of precision. 

Now, let’s talk about the truck bed. The Cybertruck features a steeply sloped bed that, to me, resembles a dump truck. There's a dampened opening for the tailgate, although it isn’t power-operated, so you'll need to close it manually, but it does have a nice soft-close mechanism.

The powered tonneau cover is another exciting feature; it can support up to 300 pounds, so you could theoretically stand on it. The cover is motorized and operates surprisingly smoothly. When activated, it automatically reveals a rear window, which while not operational (it doesn’t move up and down), at least provides visibility from the cabin. However, when the tonneau cover is closed, rear visibility is completely blocked.

Tesla also addressed concerns about the bed's design. While earlier prototypes featured a bare stainless steel bed, this version has a fully lined bed for durability. The official length of the bed measures around 66 inches, but measuring from my observation, I found it to be closer to 72 inches. There’s even a sub-trunk area that can fit a duffel or carry-on bag, plus it comes equipped with drain plugs for added functionality as a cooler.

The truck also includes several power outlets: two 120-volt and one 240-volt outlet for charging devices or even another vehicle. I’m glad to see this trend of electric vehicles incorporating the ability to power other gadgets—great for utility and convenience.

I should also mention that there is a bottle opener positioned near one of the mounting points in the trunk as well. As for the tonneau cover, it features an interesting button mechanism: press it to open completely or hold it for a partial close, which I found out can be slightly temperamental.

Moving on to the doors, there’s actually quite a bit to discuss here. The Cybertruck does not have traditional door handles, which is unusual. Instead, there’s an indented button you press to unlock the door, causing it to pop out slightly so you can easily grip it and pull open. 

I do have concerns about how these doors might function in adverse weather, particularly in cold or icy conditions. Tesla claims that if ice forms, you can press the button to break through it, though that’s yet to be tested in reality.

In terms of materials, the cabin design continues the minimalist aesthetic with a lot of metal surfaces, which can reveal fingerprints quite easily. 

At the front of the Cybertruck, you’ll notice a couple of interesting features: a sturdy plastic bumper and two tow hitch rigs. It also has a front camera, a first for Tesla, which is particularly useful given the truck’s height.

Let’s address the front trunk. It can be opened automatically, revealing a pretty shallow space. Interestingly, I haven’t seen a Tesla logo anywhere on this truck. Instead, it’s mostly branded with "Cybertruck" in welded text. While the front trunk size is comparable to fitting about two medium-sized suitcases, it’s a bit tight.

Speaking of which, I can’t help but share how well my Ridge carry-ons fit inside; they’re designed with weather-resistance and a durable shell, making them ideal for travelers.

Now let’s dive into the interior. The steering wheel looks more standard than before, which is an improvement. The oversized glass canopy stretches from the vehicle’s front all the way back, providing an impressive view and great visibility.

In terms of storage, the Cybertruck features practical door storage, a large center console area with wireless charging capabilities, and a 65-watt USB-C port. The interior maintains a balanced look with functional aesthetics. It offers adjustable ambient lighting, an interior-facing camera, and a panoramic roof that adds to the spacious feel.

One point worth mentioning is the gear selector is located above the steering column, a unique touch that I’ve never seen in any car model before. 

The backseat is surprisingly spacious, featuring a clever design that allows the rear seats to fold up for additional storage. The back also is equipped with a screen where passengers can control their environment and access various features.

Now, let’s shift to the driving experience. The 18.5-inch touchscreen center console is the largest in any Tesla, echoing the familiar setup yet revamped with a Cybertruck aesthetic.

The driving experience feels like the classic Tesla ride—instant throttle response and surprisingly agile despite its size. The truck’s handling is impressive, aided by rear-axle steering that allows for a tighter turn radius and nimble maneuverability, even in urban spaces.

However, the Cybertruck maintains a unique sense of character in how it feels to drive. With virtually no noise insulation, it’s quiet inside, thanks to its laminated windows. The vehicle feels solid and well-constructed, and though the off-road capabilities are promising, I plan to test them out further down the road.

As I merge onto the highway, the acceleration is exhilarating—this truck can genuinely move. 

One fun feature that stands out is the world’s largest windshield wiper, which is not just for show; it performs well. 

In summary, the Cybertruck delivers remarkable power and a unique driving experience. That said, it does come at a higher price point than initially anticipated, so it's essential to consider that when comparing it to other options like the F-150 Lightning or Rivian R1T. 

I look forward to a deeper dive into the truck's features and a long-term review once I get my own. Please share your thoughts on this design and performance. Let me know if you’re part of the camp that thinks the Cybertruck is a design oddity or if you’re excited about its features. 

Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you next time. Peace.
