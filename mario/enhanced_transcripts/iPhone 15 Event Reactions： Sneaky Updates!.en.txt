All right, so Apple's Wonderlust event happened, and it was pretty interesting. Honestly, not that much new stuff got announced. We knew it would mostly be about the iPhone, Apple Watch, and USB-C—nothing too surprising. However, it was the subtler details in between that I found interesting, along with a few random points that I don't think a lot of people are talking about. So let's dive in.

First off, I have to say it was a complete surprise when they quoted my MacBook Air review during the keynote. You know how, at the beginning of these events, they recap previous highlights? One of the things they featured was the MacBook Air, and they showcased my quote: “The 15-inch MacBook Air is going to instantly rocket to the top of the lineup to become the most popular 15-inch laptop.” They expressed excitement for the new MacBook Air and the entire Mac lineup. That was pretty cool. They didn’t give me a heads-up about it, didn’t ask for permission, and didn’t pay for it; they just went ahead and did it. So, shout-out to Tim Cook for that. It’s a moment of pride knowing how far we've come since the early days—back when there were zero YouTubers at these events, and now we’re recognized as part of the media landscape.

After that, they jumped right into the announcements, with the main highlight being the new iPhone. I created a separate video focusing on the iPhones, detailing my first hands-on impressions and various features, so I'll link that below the Like button if you're interested. Here’s a brief summary:

The iPhone 15 features the A16 Bionic chip from last year's iPhone Pro, the Dynamic Island from the Pro lineup, some new colors, and a slightly updated design with better curves and a softer touch on the back. It also includes a USB-C port, with the same starting price and screen sizes as last year: $799 for the iPhone 15 and $899 for the iPhone 15 Plus. 

The iPhone 15 Pro, on the other hand, gets the new three-nanometer A17 Pro chip, lighter brushed titanium rails replacing stainless steel, a faster USB-C port, a customizable action button on the side replacing the mute switch, new cameras, and the 15 Pro Max features a new 5x telephoto camera. The prices are somewhat deceptive; it's still $999 for the 15 Pro, but the Pro Max now starts at $1,199, as it also begins with 256GB of storage. There are plenty more details in that hands-on video if you're curious.

Now, onto the other highlights from the event. I thought it would be fun to shoot here because part of it is where they filmed some scenes for the keynote, but I’m realizing it’s actually a noisy place with chainsaws in the background, so I apologize for that.

Moving on to the Apple Watch announcements: Series 9 and Ultra 2. One intriguing aspect of these new watches is that, visually, there's almost no way to tell them apart from their predecessors. The Series 9 introduces a new pink color, but aside from that, it looks identical to the Series 8. The Ultra 2 looks the same as the original Ultra. However, under the hood, there’s a significant upgrade with the new S9 system on a chip, which is both more powerful and efficient. This allows for a higher maximum brightness while maintaining the same battery life. The Series 9 can now reach up to 2,000 nits, and the Ultra 2 goes up to 3,000 nits, making it the brightest display ever on any Apple product.

Additionally, Siri requests on the watch now process on-device, eliminating the need for a round trip to the internet, which should improve response times. While this doesn’t necessarily mean Siri will become great, it should be faster. Another feature is the new Ultra Wideband chip that can communicate with iPhones to make the “Find My iPhone” feature much more precise and direct rather than just playing a sound.

The most interesting update, though, is the new double-tap gesture. With the new watch, it can detect a double-tap of your thumb and index finger. At the event, I tried this several times with a demo watch, and it seemed quite accurate. You raise the watch to wake it, give it a moment, and then double-tap to interact with the primary button of whatever app you're using. This allows you to accept or reject phone calls, stop timers, or scroll through widgets quickly without needing to use your other hand. Honestly, I’d usually try to do this with my nose, so it’s a welcome improvement.

What makes this update sneaky is that it’s not entirely new; if you’ve explored the accessibility settings on the Apple Watch, you might have come across a similar feature under a different name. Apple claims that the new S9 chip is faster in processing information from sensors, which is why this feature will only be available on the new S9-powered watches.

Now, let's quickly touch on AirPods, as they received a sneaky update as well. During the keynote, the AirPods Pro 2 saw a brief mention of a new USB-C case, leading many to think there weren’t any substantial updates. However, this isn’t entirely accurate. The AirPods Pro 2 with the Lightning case and those with the USB-C case are essentially the same product with different ports, unless you have the Apple Vision Pro. In that case, the USB-C version supports lossless audio with low latency through a new codec developed specifically for it, enhancing the immersive experience. If you don’t have the Vision Pro, then yes, they’re pretty much the same product aside from the type of charging case. Apple hasn't emphasized this differentiation to avoid making recent buyers feel left out, but there are indeed distinctions in the hardware for the new USB-C version.

This leads to the last major theme of the event: carbon neutrality and environmental initiatives. Apple was very vocal about their environmental efforts during the keynote, including a lengthy skit with Tim Cook and Apple employees discussing their progress. I’ll delve deeper into this in a future video since I’m not an expert and can’t entirely grasp everything that was presented. However, some points were clear, like their commitment to eliminate leather from all products, using recycled materials, and sourcing more sustainable energy.

Apple ultimately announced that the Apple Watch is the first fully carbon-neutral product they’re shipping, aiming for full carbon neutrality as a company by 2030. While it’s true they have a long way to go, I can't really criticize the improvements being made. It’s reminiscent of those YouTube videos where someone gives money to someone in need while being recorded; it's hard to argue that some good isn’t done even if the motive isn't entirely pure.

I’m definitely interested in learning more and discussing this with environmental experts in the future. Those are my thoughts and reactions from the 2023 Wonderlust event.
