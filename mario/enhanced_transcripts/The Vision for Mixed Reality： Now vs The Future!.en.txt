All right, here's a theory I've been thinking about. Someday, maybe not next year, or even in five or ten years, but maybe someday we'll all live in a world where we have wearable computers on our faces all the time. Many tech companies really believe in that future. I've never spoken to anyone on Planet Earth who believes more than Mark Zuckerberg that humans are headed toward spending a lot of their time in some sort of metaverse. 

However, the technology is clearly not good enough yet, at least in 2023, for anyone to want to fully engage with it. For example, this is what a VR headset looks like in 2023, and this is the best we have. The computers, pixels, batteries—everything on your face—is just too much for people to want to spend all day using a device like this. But there's a collective agreement that maybe someday the technology will shrink down until it looks like a normal pair of glasses. At that point, perhaps we'll all be comfortable wearing them every day.

This brings us to the Quest 3, the latest and greatest headset from Meta. My theory is that on one side of the scale, we have VR headsets, and on the other side, we have smart glasses. Meta has also announced smart glasses at their event, known as the RayBan Meta Smart Glasses, or RayBan Stories 2. As of now, they are quite simple; they only incorporate a camera, small speakers, and a battery. However, there are some clever tricks that allow them to maximize their functionality. Perhaps one day the technology will become powerful and useful enough for people to want to use these every day.

VR headsets are racing to get smaller, while smart glasses are striving to improve their technology. Both are essentially racing toward each other, and companies like Meta are investing significant amounts of money to determine which strategy will succeed first.

Let's start with the headset. The Quest 3 has made a significant pivot to being a mixed reality headset, which seems like a natural progression for making these devices more comfortable for everyday wear like glasses. In previous VR headsets, pass-through functionality felt like an afterthought; you'd put the headset on and immediately be immersed in your own world until taking it off. The new version, while still immersive with light-blocking displays, features more sensors around the outside, vastly improving pass-through capabilities. It's now color, stereo, very low latency, and decently high resolution.

Having such a high-quality pass-through comes with numerous benefits. First, the setup is far more intuitive. You can take it to a new space, put it on, and it will automatically map out the floor of the room. It accurately identifies available space and objects around you using RGB cameras and a Lidar sensor. You no longer need to painstakingly draw a play area each time you use it; it feels as though the menu is floating right where you are standing.

You might wonder how good the Quest 3 actually is compared to others, such as the Quest Pro. Yes, it is better than the Quest Pro but not as good as the Apple Vision Pro. I would liken it to wearing a clear pair of glasses that aren’t exactly your prescription. The Quest 3 features stereo and color capabilities, near real-time response, and accurate color representation, allowing you to see your hands and locate controllers without help. While there can be some distortion with close objects and at the edges of your vision, it's still of high enough fidelity for enjoyable use. You'll still need to take the headset off to read texts or use your phone screen.

Comparing it to a $3,500 headset seems unnecessary, but many people ask me about it, and I happen to have experience with both. The Apple Vision Pro still offers the best pass-through I've experienced, as I could take notes on my phone while wearing it—which was quite impressive. However, for a $500 headset, the Quest 3 is the best you can get right now and has high-resolution menus with accurate controller tracking, which is fantastic.

Another major advantage of the high-quality sensors on the headset is that you might not even need controllers at all. You have the option to use either the controllers or your hands. The controllers have improved over the years, becoming smaller and more responsive with better haptics. Hand tracking has also gotten significantly better, contributing to a more intuitive, futuristic feel. You can perform pinch gestures to pull up menus and select items, scroll through menus by touching and flipping them in space, or move windows around with ease. Typing, however, is still a challenge without haptic feedback, as you'll be poking at an invisible space where the virtual keyboard exists.

Despite these limitations, the primary selling point of this headset remains gaming. It supports all the same games as the Quest 2, with additional titles optimized for the Quest 3. With the next-gen Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip, higher resolution per eye, and a more immersive field of view, it's slightly more comfortable thanks to a new strap that enhances weight distribution. Personally, I’ve enjoyed playing a golf game that felt surprisingly realistic, as well as ping pong, which features a multiplayer mode where another player’s avatar stands in your space. Of course, you still have classics like Beat Saber and Super Hot, along with new titles emerging.

Now, let's talk about the smart glasses. These are the Meta Smart Glasses, which are limited by the amount of technology that can fit into a regular-looking pair of glasses that nobody pays much attention to. However, as technology continues to improve and miniaturize, these glasses will become increasingly capable over time. Right now, they come with a 12-megapixel camera and an LED light ring indicating when they are recording or taking pictures.

They include a shutter button, a computer with storage, a touchpad, microphones, and tiny speakers that direct sound into your ears. While they may not seem like much at first, when paired with your phone and the Meta View app, they become quite powerful as a wearable computing device. You can use the camera for first-person pictures and videos limited to 60 seconds, and despite these constraints, they produce solid content. You can also start a recording or take a picture using voice commands, though you might prefer to use the shutter for convenience.

Although they can send and receive audio messages through Meta platforms like WhatsApp, they lack a screen, making them most suitable for audio-based activities. They're always connected to your phone via Bluetooth, allowing you to listen to music. The directional speakers minimize sound leakage at lower volumes, and while they can get pretty loud, it's more akin to someone listening nearby with open-back headphones.

You can interact with the Meta virtual assistant to ask questions, and it will respond audibly in your ears. Though it has limitations—such as not being able to set alarms or integrate with non-Meta services—the glasses' design allows for discreet phone calls in public, which is a significant selling point. They come in two styles, the Headliner and the Wayfarer. 

However, the biggest downside is battery life. With limited capacity, the glasses will typically last under two hours with heavy use. Meta claims a total of 36 hours of battery life with the charging case, which works similarly to earbuds.

This tech really represents the pinnacle of what's possible in a normal-looking pair of glasses today, but as technology advances, we can expect to see more features packed into these small frames. The central question remains: Which of these technologies will achieve mass adoption first? Tech companies need to decide where to invest. Meta has a stake in both, so they may win either way. Snapchat’s primarily focused on smart glasses, while Apple has begun with the Vision Pro and is already working on miniaturizing that tech.

What a fascinating time to witness all of this! The technology we’ll be using on our faces in 10 to 20 years will look truly remarkable compared to what we have now, just as the technology from a decade ago seems outdated now.

In conclusion, here's what I think: 

1. The Quest 3, priced at $500, is an excellent option if you're looking for a VR or mixed reality headset.
2. Apple’s Vision Pro is set to launch in early 2024, and I expect it to be impressive, so stay tuned for that review.
3. We're undoubtedly moving toward a future where wearable computers will be commonplace on our faces. 

Even if you doubt that we'll all wear these devices for a long time, it’s likely that we’ll get something smaller and more unobtrusive as time goes on. 

So, which side do you pick? Thanks for watching. Catch you on the next one. Peace.
