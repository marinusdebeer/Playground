All right, so this is a crypto phone. And I know what you’re thinking: "What the hell is a crypto phone, and why would anyone want that?" That’s exactly what I thought when this first crossed my radar.

This is an upper mid-range Android phone with unique material choices from a brand you’ve likely never heard of, featuring specific crypto functions, and it launched at a thousand dollars. Now, I know I have been notably skeptical about crypto, Web3, blockchain, and the Metaverse over the past couple of years, so you may consider me biased. However, I still believe that if you took the crypto out of this phone, it would at least have potential. I’m serious. Let me explain.

The story of this phone actually starts all the way back with the Essential Phone. I don’t know how many of you remember the Essential Phone from 2017, but it was a really interesting and exciting development in the smartphone world. We don’t see many genuinely promising new phone companies emerging, which is what this Andy Rubin startup was promising when they introduced their first phone. It featured a refreshing, minimal design with no protruding camera bumps or big logos. They were one of the first to incorporate a camera notch at the top of the screen with thin bezels and were among the only ones using super premium materials like titanium rails and polished ceramic on the back, along with modular accessory pins on the back — genuinely interesting and cool ideas on top of super clean software.

Unfortunately, this experiment didn’t really catch on. The combination of a high price, mediocre cameras, and a lackluster feature set for everyday consumers, along with launching as a Sprint exclusive, led to extremely low sales. The company eventually disbanded after negative revelations about Andy Rubin, and we never got to see a second iteration, the Essential Phone 2.

It’s disappointing to see a promising company with significant talent disappear like that. However, a common occurrence when such businesses dissolve is that the teams involved often find new opportunities. In 2020, a group of engineers from the original Essential team got back together to form a new company called OSOM. They announced their first project, the OSOM OV1, effectively the spiritual successor to the Essential Phone. You can see many similarities in the announcement, including those premium materials — titanium and polished ceramic — and a rectangular design. They also aimed to correct many of the issues that plagued the original Essential Phone, with a noticeably larger size, bigger screen, and bigger battery. 

However, they didn’t generate enough interest in this new startup phone to bring the whole idea back to life. This is the classic enthusiast phone problem: it's a cool idea that some people really want, but there isn’t enough hype to make it happen. That is until Solana came along. Solana is a Web3 company exploring new projects while OSOM is a hardware team seeking backing to make this phone a reality. Solana brought the funding, and OSOM provided the hardware talent, partnering to turn the OV1 into the rebranded Solana Saga crypto phone, priced at a thousand dollars. 

So where do we start? There are basically three things that make this a crypto phone rather than just another Android phone: the Solana Mobile Stack, the Seed Vault, and the Dapp store. Outside of those things, the OV1 or the Solana phone is pretty average for an Android device. It has a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip, which is last year’s flagship, with 12 GB of RAM and half a terabyte of storage. However, it's unclear whether it utilizes fast UFS 3.1. It features a nice big 6.67-inch flat 1080p 120 Hz display that gets decently bright, although it’s not LTPO; it simply has a fixed refresh rate. The phone is powered by a 4,100 mAh battery with wireless charging, which is mediocre considering the screen size, but acceptable. It’s also IP68 water and dust resistant, with a microSD card slot for storage expansion.

However, it has a pair of really mediocre cameras on the back. It carries the same 50-megapixel main camera sensor found in the ROG Phone 7 and the Oppo Find X5 Pro but with inferior software. It’s paired with a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and both can only produce decent images in perfect lighting before falling apart due to a lack of detail and excessive noise. Overall, it's a mixed bag.

That said, there are two things about this phone that I’m genuinely impressed by. The first is the materials; the build quality is exceptional. Since it’s basically the same team from the original Essential Phone, they have a knack for using high-quality materials. We’re talking about a matte stainless steel frame with colored titanium buttons and a full ceramic back. While it picks up fingerprints easily, this phone is incredibly durable. It weighs around 250 grams, making it heavier than an iPhone 14 Pro Max. It features nicely squared-off sides, feels solid with no squeaking or creaking, and is ultimately a well-crafted housing for average specs.

The second thing I appreciate, aside from the crypto features, is the clean software experience. Once you dig into it, it feels very clean, almost like stock Android. It runs Android 13, and while it’s unclear when (or if) it will get Android 14, the system is quick, responsive, and straightforward. You’ll find stock Android quick settings, wallpaper options, and Google apps like clock, calendar, and Chrome.

Now, does any of this justify the thousand-dollar price tag? (exhales) Let’s see: last year’s flagship specs, lackluster cameras, a mediocre battery, and not an impressive screen. While it does have stock Android and good build quality, it doesn’t seem worth a thousand bucks, does it? That's precisely why, less than a year after its release, the price plummeted from a thousand to $600.

So the real question is: would anyone pay $600 for a barely above-average, well-built Android phone that just happens to have some crypto features? (sighs) I guess now I need to go over all the crypto and Web3 features. As I mentioned earlier, there are three things that make this a crypto phone.

The Solana Mobile Stack is an SDK for apps to connect to the Solana blockchain. While it’s cool that it’s built in, a downside is that it doesn’t work with any other blockchain. Hence, no Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum support — it’s strictly focused on Solana. The Seed Vault provides dedicated storage for a 24-word seed phrase, kept in a secure environment inaccessible to the Android OS. This lets you unlock your wallet. Lastly, there’s the so-called Dapp store, essentially a second app store on this device specifically for crypto apps. It includes Phantom Wallet, the cryptocurrency exchange OKX, Brave Browser, and more. There’s even an app called Minty Fresh that allows you to convert photos from your camera roll into NFTs quickly, if that’s something you’re interested in.

These are the only three features that truly distinguish this as a crypto phone. However, one of those features, the Dapp store, isn’t particularly special since it will become available on non-crypto phones as well. 

Moreover, I believe you could argue that it’s great to have those specific crypto features built directly into the phone, especially if you’re within the Solana ecosystem, as this is the only place to access those features. However, that’s an incredibly niche offering. Reflecting on the recent Zenfone 10 discussion, which I really enjoy but doubt will sell, it’s a shame how few people prefer small phones. Now consider the likelihood that there are more people interested in the Solana ecosystem who want to buy a dedicated phone versus those desiring a compact phone.

To me, the most intriguing aspect of this project is this cable that comes in the box with the phone. It’s a braided USB-C cable, but it features a hard switch at the end that blocks all data while allowing only power to pass through, effectively converting it into a charging cable. This is fantastic for preventing "juice jacking" attacks, where a public outlet might upload malware to your device or download your data. This cable will prevent that from happening. If you ever find yourself using a rare public USB-C port, this is a fantastic tool to have, but it’s not unique — you can find similar cables on Amazon for around $30, and I’ll link that below.

At this point, I don’t need to tell you that the crypto phone is essentially just a standard Android phone with a couple of interesting but extremely niche crypto features focused on one specific crypto stack — one that is currently struggling, by the way. Moreover, there’s practically no reason for 99.99% of people to buy this phone. Even if you were considering it just for the clean stock Android experience and completely disregarding the crypto features, you could easily find better alternatives for $600. A Pixel 7, likely a Pixel 8 upon release, or a refurbished Galaxy S23 would all be superior options. 

Ultimately, I don’t think this phone should top anyone’s list at that price point. It’s unfortunate because being a new phone company is an incredibly tough challenge unless your name is Carl Pei. I wish there were a world where the OSOM OV1 could thrive and be embraced by a niche community, but instead, it’s become a representation of crypto in 2023 — at best, ahead of its time; at worst, utterly useless for most everyday users and creates an even steeper uphill challenge for whatever follows.

Thanks for watching. Catch you on the next one. Peace.
