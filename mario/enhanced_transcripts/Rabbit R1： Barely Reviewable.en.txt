So, this is the Rabbit R1. It's yet another AI in a box, reflecting the times we're in. This device shares a lot in common with the Humane AI Pin, for better or worse, but it's also designed to have two specific features that are supposed to set it apart. At least, that's the idea, and we need to talk about it.

Stop me if this sounds familiar, but check this out: it's a virtual assistant in a box. However, this one is not wearable; it's meant to be carried around like a smartphone. It's about the size of a stack of Post-its, constructed from lightweight plastic by Teenage Engineering—a brand that’s currently quite popular. You can easily recognize it from a distance. 

There’s a single button on the right side, which you press and hold to ask questions. Instead of a projector, it features a built-in screen. There's no onboard cellular connectivity, but there is a SIM card tray alongside the USB Type-C port for charging. It does seem to send almost every request to the cloud, but I have to say, it feels significantly quicker in answering questions than the Humane AI Pin. While that's not a high bar, it's reliably faster.

For example, if I ask, “How far away is the moon?” 

- [AI Voice] “The average distance between Earth and the Moon is approximately 384,400 kilometers.”

You can connect headphones via Bluetooth or turn the built-in speaker up, as I have, and the device displays the text of your answers on the screen, right underneath a bouncing rabbit icon, along with the time and battery status. In fact, that bouncing rabbit is almost always visible; it indicates that the device is awake. You hit the button once to put it to sleep or it automatically goes to sleep after a few seconds. Press the button again to wake it up—boom, just the rabbit waiting for you.

To access the settings, there’s no button or gesture to initiate that; you simply shake it like an Etch A Sketch. Once you do that, you can scroll up and down using the scroll wheel and select options with the button. That’s how you navigate the user interface.

The two features that differentiate it are the scroll wheel and a swiveling camera. The scroll wheel is unconventional for navigating the UI, but the AI assistant also has multimodal capabilities, allowing you to use visual input to answer questions based on what it sees. 

We’ve seen this before: with this device, you double-tap to expose the camera and press and hold to ask. For instance, I might ask, “What type of plant is this?”

- [AI Voice] "Taking a look now. The plant in the image appears to be a Monstera deliciosa, also known as a Swiss cheese plant. This is a type of tropical climbing evergreen plant native to southern Mexico and parts of Central America."

As a reviewer testing this device, I can’t help but feel somewhat like DJ Khaled after a while, just pointing at things:

- “Okay, what is this?”
  
- [Speaker] “Those are pickled banana peppers.”

- "And what is this?"

- [Speaker] “Berries and seeds.”

- "And perhaps what is this?"

- [Speaker] “Water.”

I’ve even pointed the device at my computer screen with a lengthy email displayed and asked for a summary, and it just reads it and delivers the summary instantly. It’s done the same with articles, and I find that pretty cool. So, ultimately, it’s just an AI in a box—best at answering questions.

However, this device has a lot of shortcomings, and the list will sound familiar. The battery life is just as poor as the Humane Pin’s. It has a rather unimpressive battery life and drains quickly, dying within four hours, leading to the need for multiple charges a day. It was a pain to charge; it took 45 minutes to go from zero to a hundred percent.

Moreover, it lacks several basic features. For example, it can't set alarms or timers, record videos or photos, or send emails, and there’s no integrated calendar. There are just many functions you would typically expect from an assistant that aren't present. And being an AI assistant, it still hallucinates and often gives incorrect answers to questions. I frequently find myself asking questions I already know the answers to, just to get wrong responses—one of the downfalls of this technology.

This device comes from Teenage Engineering, and you can certainly see their design flair—it’s bright orange, quirky, and friendly looking. They love their analog controls, and while the scroll wheel doesn’t surprise me, I find it frustrating to use. It protrudes slightly from the back, which looks cool, but it limits its sensitivity; so it takes considerable scrolling to move down even one line in the settings. There’s also no haptic feedback while scrolling, which would help track movement. 

You can get used to it and learn to use the button for selection, but there’s no back button on the device. This means you have to scroll back up to the top every single time to go back. Adjusting brightness or volume requires two hands: you select brightness with one hand while scrolling with the other, which complicates what should be simple adjustments.

It’s workable, and you might say it has a quirky interface, but I can’t help but feel many of these issues could be addressed with a touchscreen. What if I told you it does have a touchscreen, but it's only utilized minimally? You can use it for typing in terminal mode—turn it sideways, and a keyboard pops up for questions, and you can navigate letters using the scroll wheel. It’s somewhat neat, but why not use the touchscreen for anything else? Is it an attempt to avoid looking too much like a smartphone? Possibly.

So, what’s the point? Why does this thing exist if it's so similar to another poorly received device? The two aspects they hope will set it apart are its price tag and its large action model. The Humane Pin received widespread criticism for its $700 price combined with a $24 a month subscription to avoid turning into a brick—which is quite outrageous. The Rabbit R1, however, costs $200 with no subscription fee. This is a more manageable investment, but it's important to note that you’ll need a separate SIM card for cellular functionality. While there’s no subscription fee, you will still incur a monthly charge for data outside of Wi-Fi.

The unboxing experience is very basic, as it comes in a single cardboard box with a cassette tape-like plastic container which doubles as a stand—literally nothing else is included: no charging brick, no USB-C cable, no stickers, no instruction manual—nothing. The device feels well-built, with no flexing or creaking, but it is definitely plastic. The camera is basic, the speaker feels cheap, and it’s powered by a low-end MediaTek chip found in more affordable phones. It doesn’t have fast or wireless charging, and it only comes in one color—this saturated bright orange, which is challenging to photograph accurately. 

If you prefer something less flashy than neon orange, channel sponsor dbrand can help. They offer skins for the device, including this black camo appearance, which looks pretty cool. They also collaborated to create screen protectors available since launch day.

Speaking of the screen, it features a 2.9-inch diagonal TFT display without auto brightness. So, you get the idea—it’s not very advanced.

Just like the Humane AI Pin, this device has no apps. The other feature they're hoping will distinguish it is what they call a "large action model." Large language models process natural language, allowing AIs to respond to us in conversational ways. A large action model, theoretically, is meant to take our commands and translate them into actions, allowing it to use apps as a human would.

Rather than relying on APIs—where a company might work with others to connect services—this model aims to replicate human interaction with apps using a mouse and keyboard, essentially acting as a virtual agent. I find this a really exciting concept. Large language models are becoming very adept at engaging with us, and a large action model should be able to interact with apps similarly.

Currently, they have made only four apps available: Spotify, Uber, DoorDash, and Midjourney. The Rabbit can communicate with these apps and offers a UI to facilitate that. For instance, it can play Spotify songs upon request and display relevant information to confirm actions. However, I've had issues with it playing incorrect songs and encountering inaccuracies with DoorDash, which is frustrating. I can’t imagine the complications if the Uber app were to misfire.

Rabbit claims to have 800 trained apps already, but they haven’t developed a UI for them yet. They’ve also started working on a concept called "Teach Mode," where the Rabbit can learn from observing you perform tasks on your computer. Unfortunately, this feature is not available at this time either. 

As of now, the device only has the four partially functioning apps. What is this all heading toward?

I want to avoid turning this into a rant, but we need to recognize that many tech companies are developing products in a rather backward way. They launch unfinished products that make it difficult to provide a proper review. It used to be that you developed a product and then sold it; now it seems they sell half-baked devices and promise to iterate and improve over time—a process that often leads to messy user experiences.

This trend spans numerous product categories. We’ve seen it in gaming, where studios release buggy “alpha versions” of full-price titles, and in automotive, where vehicles are delivered without promised features that will arrive through future software updates. Smartphones have followed suit for years, launching models with significant features promised for later. Now, with AI products at the forefront of this issue, we face nearly non-functional devices compared to their promised capabilities—but we still pay full price. This reality poses challenges not just for buyers, but also for reviewers.

How do you evaluate a product where the potential future version may seem incredible, while the current version is subpar? Should reviewers give the benefit of the doubt? I'm unsure—we need to tread carefully.

On one hand, it's promising that technology can improve over time. On the other hand, we face unfinished products that could potentially worsen before they improve.

I’m genuinely excited about the idea of a highly personalized AI assistant capable of performing tasks like a human assistant. Different companies exploring varied approaches to achieve that goal is encouraging. But achieving this vision will require considerable time, effort, technical development, and vast amounts of data. An effective assistant must know your preferences, location, activities, and much more—essentially, a wealth of personalized information.

In the case of Rabbit, focusing on a lower price point is a strategic move. Investing in the Humane Pin requires a significant financial commitment for uncertain future potential, while a $200 investment for the Rabbit feels far less daunting. If it evolves into something remarkable, it will be easier to justify the initial investment, especially if those 800 apps end up being truly useful. 

The situation reminds me of the early days of Tesla when they released cars with beta autopilot features. Tesla leveraged user data to refine its systems, enhancing its autopilot capabilities through real-world experience. Rabbit hopes to replicate that by getting devices into users’ hands to start beta testing and improving.

However, the Rabbit faces a challenge: while it offers a lower price, it lacks a strong enough initial attraction to entice users. It creates a kind of chicken-and-egg dilemma.

So, my advice is what you've likely heard before: buy a product based on its current capabilities rather than its promised future potential. This principle is especially challenging in this category because the allure of possibilities is immense, but it’s essential to remember.

And we’re still waiting to see what major players like Google and Apple will introduce in this space, likely in the near future. 

So with all that said, we’ll see. Thanks for watching, and catch you in the next one. Peace.
