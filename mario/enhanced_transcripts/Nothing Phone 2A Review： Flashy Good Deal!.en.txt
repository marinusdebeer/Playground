- Budget phones are fun because, with almost all of them, if you poke around hard enough, you'll find the area where they had to cut corners to keep the price down. So, when choosing one for yourself, it's all about picking the model that makes the trade-offs you're comfortable with. For instance, if you prioritize good build quality and cameras, the iPhone SE might be the right choice for you. Just know that you may have to compromise on screen quality or battery life. If having a large display is essential, Samsung's Galaxy A54 is worth considering. And if you want great software and camera performance, the Pixel 7A for $350 could be the way to go.

This phone isn't going to impress with raw specifications. It's not going to win any awards for having the best camera or battery life among budget phones. While its performance may not blow you away, you could make a strong case that it's the most aesthetically pleasing $350 phone available. Nothing has embraced a transparent design philosophy with their phones and earbuds, and this device follows suit. There’s even a white version that I find more appealing because it has black buttons that create a nice contrast, though the dark version looks cool as well. If the goal is to look like a Nothing phone and remain distinct, then mission accomplished.  

The arrangement of the dual cameras in the middle near the top gives it a unique look, almost reminiscent of a pair of eyes. The NFC coil surrounds the cameras, and there are three LED bars creating a glyph design around the camera area. The lower half features a PCB-inspired look, apparently influenced by the New York City subway map. Nothing has shown this design to the public, receiving mixed reactions; some people love it, while others don’t. Personally, I find the asymmetrical design unconventional yet appealing. Even if it’s not to everyone’s taste, it’s certainly visually interesting, with exposed screws, textures, and a little red square that serves no functional purpose but adds a cool aesthetic touch.  

For those who like this look but are attached to a more mundane phone, the channel sponsor dbrand has you covered with their Something skins. If you’re not already familiar, dbrand has engaged in what they call "creative plagiarism" of Nothing’s design aesthetic, available in both light and dark modes; I’ll leave a link below if you wish to check those out.

However, be aware that the price bracket is extremely competitive, so while you get a good-looking phone, there are trade-offs to consider. Firstly, the back is made of clear plastic instead of glass. I think this could make it easier to scratch, though harder to shatter compared to glass, which seems a reasonable compromise. The phone features a textured plastic frame that mimics aluminum, making it surprisingly light for its size.  

And speaking of size, this is a large phone; it's practically jumbo-sized and is 6.7 inches corner to corner, which is quite substantial. While some may not prefer a large device, many people enjoy having a big screen, reaping the benefits of having a sizable battery and display. The screen gets bright; it’s not flagship-level brightness with some of the numbers we’re seeing today, but a peak brightness of 1300 nits is quite visible in bright indoor conditions. The bezels around the front are minimal, so aesthetically, I have no complaints. Additionally, it boasts an AMOLED display with an optical fingerprint reader under the glass, a variable refresh rate of up to 120 Hz, and 2160 Hz PWM dimming. If you’re not a fan of the phone's back design, the front is impressive for $350.  

Battery life is another key strength of this device. The battery performance derives from three main factors: a large physical battery, good software, and an efficient chip. The phone comes equipped with a 5000 mAh battery, which is larger than those in Nothing's flagship models. While it lacks wireless charging, it does feature 45-watt wired charging, which can get the battery from zero to full in an hour. The device is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro chip, which was a significant point of curiosity for me during testing. Knowing how Nothing teases specifications beforehand, I wondered how this MediaTek chip would perform, especially since they showcased selective benchmark results only compared to the two-year-old Nothing Phone 1, which used a mid-range Qualcomm 778G Plus chip.

While I wasn't expecting flagship performance at this price point, I did wonder how it would hold up. I’ve been pleasantly surprised. It's not going to win accolades for raw specs, and the benchmark scores may not be mind-blowing, but in practical use, I find it respectable. This is largely thanks to the software and its optimization.  

Currently, we’re running Nothing OS 2.5 on top of Android 14. You might be familiar with Nothing Phone’s aesthetic featuring dots and its unique fonts. The clean interface lacks bloatware and emphasizes speed and smoothness, reminiscent of the early days of OnePlus. Regular use reveals that this phone is smooth and snappy. Occasionally, you might notice a slight lag with the fingerprint reader when unlocking, but overall, general tasks—like messaging, browsing apps, and taking photos—are performed seamlessly. 

You can expect a solid experience similar to what was found on the Nothing Phone 1 with the 778 chip. It handles everyday use well; however, when you attempt high-end tasks like gaming, you may notice the performance lag compared to high benchmarks. But again, it’s a $350 phone, so I have no complaints.  

Nothing has taken time to develop their aesthetic and identity, and I have to say, they’ve incorporated a lot of unique, identifiable features into this device. You might love or hate them, but they are all present. Aesthetic elements include dot motifs throughout, consistent with their stock apps and system navigation. They also offer a well-established selection of Nothing widgets, allowing for a consistent home screen vibe.  

There are also neat features, such as enlarging a single app icon to occupy a four-grid space on your home screen, which some might find appealing. The folders on the home screen have a nice animation, and there’s a new option to add a glass effect to your wallpaper, blurring it for better visibility—a feature I particularly enjoy. AI wallpapers are also available, letting you create interesting combinations with just a few taps. Third-party icon pack support makes the customization options endless, complete with instant previews.

As for the glyphs, this phone still has lights on the back—fewer than the flagship model, but similar in functionality. There’s one vertical light on the right, a smaller one on the bottom left, and a larger one arcing around the top left. The latter works with the glyph countdown timer, which might be useful for some.  

The blinking notification glyph when the phone is face-down could use some more customization options. I’d love RGB capabilities to set different colors for various app notifications, but it still functions with white lights. There are also music visualizations that sync with audio output.  

Sure, some of these features may feel gimmicky or only occasionally useful, but I find some novelty in them, like the glyph fill flash, depending on the situation. But let's talk about the camera. The rear cameras are serviceable; they aren't going to stun you, but they get the job done. We generally approach reviews of budget phones with the expectation that their cameras won’t impress.  

This model features a new 50-megapixel primary camera, alongside the same ultra-wide camera seen in the Nothing Phone 2 and a similar selfie camera. While it can capture decent photos, even with the 50-megapixel resolution, low-quality images emerge in good lighting conditions, with less than stellar sharpness, dynamic range, and depth of field. This phone isn't designed for capturing the most artistic photos and videos, but it is functional for moments like document scanning, video calls, and sharing quick snaps—completely adequate for those needs.

What struck me most is that this model retains many features found in Nothing's flagship phones. The only exception is the macro mode. This consistency, with advanced settings and features from the more expensive models, gives a good feel for this device as a budget-friendly option, making it seem like they’re trying to provide as much of the Nothing experience for less money.

That said, it’s important to acknowledge the cuts that have been made; for example, there’s no wireless charging, it has an IP54 rating instead of IP68, and the construction is plastic rather than glass and aluminum. Nevertheless, using the phone, especially with its software features, doesn’t feel like there are many glaring omissions. There’s no missing pro mode setting in the camera; all advanced settings and features from Nothing OS are present on this cheaper model.  

In summary, while they aim to position this phone against others in the lower-end market, I instinctively dismissed comparisons to the Phone 1. However, looking back, one can appreciate how much progress has been made. The Nothing Phone 2A offers a larger, brighter screen with thinner bezels, a larger battery with faster charging, a higher processor clock speed, a higher-resolution front camera, and a wider variety of refresh rates than the Phone 1. No wonder they want to showcase the Phone 1.

To wrap it up, if you're seeking a TL;DR: this is indeed a solid, all-around budget phone. With Nothing promising three years of Android updates, I believe it represents a great budget option for the next few years. Well done, Nothing. Well done.  

Thanks for watching! Catch you guys in the next one. Base.
