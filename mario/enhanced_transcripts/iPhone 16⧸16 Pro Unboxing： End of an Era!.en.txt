So, it's a bit of a tradition around here to unbox the newest iPhones on the day they come out. We're upholding this tradition this year to find one single difference compared to last year's unboxings. We’ve got four iPhones here in new colors: the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, where the boxes show the back of the phones, and the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, which display the front. I'm definitely going to start with the base phones, the crowd favorites this year. Finally, there are some colors back in the iPhone lineup.

I’m going to call this one the flagship color: the Ultra Marine iPhone 16. In the box, you get a USB-C cable, again braided and high quality, and a tiny bit of paperwork, shaped like a pill. You'll notice that there’s no SIM card tool, just like last year, and no stickers this year either. There are absolutely no stickers included in the iPhone 16 box. Truly the end of an era. They just can't stop removing things.

Let’s take a look at the pink Plus-sized phone, too. These phones are the same sizes as last year: 6.1 inches for the base and 6.7 inches for the Plus. However, they have bigger batteries inside, which I'm really happy to hear about and very curious to test. I'm just glad we finally have colors back. The back of the phone is slightly more pale, but the glass around the camera is darker, and the rails of the phone are also darker, which looks nice. The same contents are in the box.

Now, with the Pro phones, there’s a reason they show the front of the phone on the box: if they displayed the back, you literally could not tell the difference from last year. At least this model has slightly thinner bezels they can showcase. This year, we have the Natural Titanium iPhone 16 Pro. Aside from the lack of stickers in the box, it looks and feels basically the same as the titanium iPhone 15 Pro. It comes with the same USB-C cable as the base phone, too. Great!

As for the new flagship Pro color, the renders we saw at first were a bit strange, but this is the official Desert Titanium color. All of Apple's phones are a bit more pale on the back this year, but have more color on the sides, which is definitely true here. The color is reminiscent of light sand but also has similarities to past gold hues.

That wraps up the iPhone 16 unboxing experience. By the time you see this uploaded, it means I’m deep into my iPhone 16 testing and working on the full review. So, definitely subscribe to catch that when it drops. If there are any specific things you want to see discussed or that haven’t been covered enough in the review, let me know in the comment section below. 

Now, I can share some quick observations from my first few days and my first week of testing. First of all, there is a size difference compared to last year. The base phones are the same sizes, as noted: 6.1 and 6.7 inches in the same body sizes. However, the Pro phones are both bigger. The iPhone 16 Pro goes from 6.1 to 6.3 inches. Even with the thinner bezels, the phone is slightly taller and wider. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has grown from 6.7 inches to 6.9 inches diagonally, making it an absolutely gigantic phone. It's already huge, but now it’s even taller and wider—biggest phone they’ve ever made. If you look at it next to the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is also a massive phone for context, you'll see how large it is, and that phone even comes with a stylus.

It's clear that Apple has put more battery capacity in this phone, which is great. I'm glad they're not going the route of making it thinner or shrinking battery size. However, if you opt for the new Pro Max this year, you're getting a genuinely huge phone—borderline tablet-sized.

On a random note, thanks to the new cameras positioned in the corners, these new iPhones are major table rockers. The uneven camera on the back is a bit annoying, especially when typing on a table.

I have been taking some pictures and videos with the new cameras and will be posting many more soon. If you want to follow my journey on Instagram, where I’ll share more in the coming days, I’ll link that below. My first impression is that it’s quite remarkable how consistent Apple’s image processing pipeline is every year. Unlike many companies that switch sensors, leading to a change in the overall look, Apple's phones maintain the same recognizable iPhone look year after year, regardless of hardware or sensor updates.

I've also run some benchmarks and gathered the new Geekbench 6 scores for the new A18/A18 Pro in these phones. I’m not noticing a massive difference in performance with these new phones. The true impact will be felt more in high-demand scenarios and as the phones age. However, Geekbench revealed that all of these models now have eight gigabytes of RAM. Previously, the Pro phones had different amounts of RAM compared to the regular models, but that’s no longer the case.

Apple emphasized in the keynote that these are the first phones built from the ground up for Apple Intelligence. Is that what this indicates? Clearly, a lot of memory is needed to run these AI models, and all the phones have a more powerful neural engine compared to last year. However, these devices all launch with iOS 18.0, which has zero Apple Intelligence features available on launch. But that’s a discussion for another day.

The most significant new physical change in these devices is the added button here. Apple refused to refer to it as a button during the keynote and even doubled down in several executive interviews that day. It's quite odd.

- To just put out the biggest burning question right front and center in the discourse: it is a real button, right? 

- Ah! (group laughing)

- It’s a physical thing that depresses, right?

- I think it’s a first of its kind. There is a tactile switch that gives you that final click.

- So, just to clarify, it is an actual moving, clicking physical button called Camera Control. (laughs) But it's more than just a button. It’s made its way onto all these phones, not just the Pros.

Let’s dive into that. The Camera Control button, as the name suggests, only controls camera-related functions. It’s not like another Action button; it's a Camera Control button. Press it once to open the camera, press it again to take a photo, and hold it down to start recording a quick video. It also has a large capacitive touch-sensitive surface with a vibration motor underneath. While it doesn't half-press, the vibration motor simulates the feeling of a half-press, akin to a real camera. You can double-tap to switch through various camera controls like zoom, photographic styles, or tone.

It takes some getting accustomed to since the swipes have momentum physics, meaning you can swipe too fast or too far and overshoot what you intended. It can feel a bit finicky, especially as you can perform all these actions using the on-screen buttons. That being said, when using Camera Control, all of the other buttons fade away, encouraging you to utilize the Camera Control for your needs.

The placement of the button seems designed with landscape mode in mind, but ideally, it would have been better positioned at the corner. Given how many people capture photos and videos vertically, they placed it further up, splitting the difference.

Additionally, third-party apps will be able to integrate with it if they use the camera. It’s already working with Kino, and it's expected to work with Snapchat soon, along with other camera-related apps.

I was also curious about how cases would accommodate this new button. It turns out there are basically two options. The first option is a simple cutout on the side of the case, exposing it to the finger. This would likely be the route most inexpensive cases take, but it means the button won’t be flush with the case. The second option, which Apple’s first-party cases employ, is a little insert made of glass that transfers the capacitance from the button outside the case to the Camera Control button on the phone itself, maintaining a flush feel. It appears to work quite well—the half press still functions smoothly, the swiping works properly, and the vibration motor transfers through.

Interestingly, Beats by Dre cases now include this feature. Yes, I’ll say it again: there are Beats by Dre iPhone cases now! It’s surprising since I thought Beats primarily focused on audio products, but perhaps they’re expanding into the realm of iPhone accessories.

I wish, and I know I’m not alone in this, that this button also functioned as Touch ID, but then they wouldn’t be able to call it Camera Control, I guess. I wonder if there’s a possibility of that in the future.

Speaking of third-party accessories, that’s where dbrand comes in as our video sponsor. For this sponsor segment, we’re doing something a bit different. Screen protectors aren’t my favorite thing. They can be a hassle to install, with alignment and dust being common issues. This is why I don’t use them all the time. 

But that’s where channel sponsor dbrand sees an opportunity. They believe I can install their Prism 2.0 screen protector blindfolded, which is what I'm going to try to do. The instructions I received are quite simple: just get the screen protector, grab the phone, line it up, pull the tab, and swipe down the middle to press it down. Then give it a few seconds, and that should be it.

Let’s see how it goes. (fingers tapping) I’ll take this off. (installation frame clunking) And it looks like it’s not even installed. But it is! It totally is, and it’s perfect!

Every Prism comes with two protectors, so if you mess up the first one, you have a second chance. If you want to check these out for the iPhone or any number of phones they produce, I’ll have a link below. 

That’s been it! Thanks for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace.
