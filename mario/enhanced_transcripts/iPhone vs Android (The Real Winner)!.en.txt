- All right, welcome to the definitive iPhone versus Android video. It's the impossible debate, right? In many ways, people get so entrenched on one side that they never want to flip to the other. To each their own—you hear that all the time—but I have a solution.

Here's how we're going to do this. I’m going to break it down into seven meaningful categories. It’s an odd number, so there has to be a winner—no ties. But since we know that one winner doesn’t automatically apply to every human on earth, I'm going to provide you with a system, a rubric, to help determine the real winner for yourself. You'll see what I mean. Let’s get into it.

Category number one: Customization. If you see an icon and get excited, then you probably love customization too. Digging into the settings, tweaking the home screen and lock screen, and customizing behaviors to make the device perfect for you—it's a hobby all on its own.

At first glance in 2023, it might seem like iOS 17 and Android 14 are pretty close. Let’s be real: iOS added some fantastic features, particularly with the new lock screen update, which allows you to change clock fonts and colors, add useful widgets, and save different setups for various situations and focus modes. Plus, widgets were added to the home screen less than two years ago, unlocking a lot of customization possibilities.

However, the more you look into it, the more you realize it’s not actually that close. Apple keeps adding abilities, but you’re always restricted to doing it the Apple way. That’s why many iPhone setups still look quite similar. If you take stock Android 14 from the Google Pixel, which isn’t even the most customizable version of Android, there's still much more you can modify—from theme colors matching your wallpaper thanks to Material You to custom widget sizes. Android offers you the freedom to do whatever you want.

On the iPhone, you can’t expand a widget to any size, place an app where you want on the home screen, or change the grid size or icon sizes easily. It takes a lot of extra effort just to use a custom icon. 

That said, it's worth noting that you can create a truly ugly Android setup, while it’s hard to mess up an iPhone home screen significantly. While you could argue that iOS is prettier, the winner for most customization is Android.

Moving on to category number two: Features. It simply comes down to which platform can do more. This has long been a hot topic in iOS versus Android discussions, mostly because both platforms have launched with missing features, particularly the iPhone. You might have heard remarks like, “Can you believe the iPhone can’t even set wallpapers?” or “Is it really just getting copy and paste now?”

Now, it’s 2023, and both platforms are very complete. They often copy each other’s features. You’ll see a new Android release and think, “That came from iOS,” and vice versa. There are even some new features on the iPhone that Android doesn’t have, like focus modes for fine-tuning notifications in various situations. There are also privacy features like Hide My Email and iCloud Private Relay. Dynamic Island on the Pro iPhone could be viewed as a feature, but it’s limited to a small number of apps.

At this point, neither OS is missing any massive features. They’ve both matured into their own identities and offer a lot. However, I’m still giving the edge to Android because of the countless little OS-level tweaks—like battery management options, file management systems, gaming modes, independent volume controls, and reverse wireless charging. 

The variety of features available makes it clear: if you want fast charging, a 10x camera, or USB Type-C, you’ll have to go Android. Winner again? Android.

Next is category number three: Ease of use. This is important to many people. Ease of use often has an inverse relationship with customization and features. There’s a balancing act between user flexibility and not overwhelming them with options. This is where the iPhone excels.

The iPhone has kept its fundamental design simple. For instance, the home screen has had four icons in the dock from the beginning, and the phone icon has always been green and to the left. The camera app has generally stayed the same, which hides many settings away in a separate app, making it feel a bit less feature-rich. But, fundamentally, it’s easy for most people to use. 

While there are downsides, like Siri being mostly neglected, Apple tends to keep things consistent. Any changes, like moving the end call button, seem to spark outrage. Conversely, Android often shifts things around, leading to inconsistent user experiences, which can be frustrating for the average user. 

Additionally, iPhones tend to have less bloatware, and customer service tends to be better due to the widespread presence of Apple stores. For those who aren't tech enthusiasts and just want a phone that works, they typically opt for the iPhone. Ease of use? Check for the iPhone.

Now we must discuss updates. Category number four: Support. This is somewhat underrated. Many people don’t consider long-term software and security updates when purchasing new phones, but it should be a priority. 

In the Android world, some manufacturers don’t make solid promises regarding updates. Some offer short-term support, while a few can extend promises to three or four years. Currently, Samsung is the leader in Android software updates; they announced in 2019 that all devices from that year on would receive four years of security updates, with some flagships getting five.

However, nothing compares to Apple. When iOS 17 arrives this fall, every iPhone back to the iPhone 10R from 2018 will be supported, giving it five major software updates. I doubt any Android devices from 2018 will receive Android 14 when it launches. So this category easily goes to Apple.

Moving on to category number five: Apps. Both platforms have millions of apps now—over 3.5 million in the Google Play Store and over 1.5 million in Apple’s App Store. While this initially seems like a win for Android due to quantity, it’s really about quality. 

Every major app is available on both platforms, meaning there’s a plethora of niche apps in the Google Play Store. However, many developers prioritize iOS for updates simply for efficiency. Updating one version for all iPhones means faster releases as they all have similar specs. On Android, the vast number of devices complicates this process.

Having a plethora of titles is one thing, but is it the same Instagram app or Threads app on both platforms? Having used apps on both systems, I can confidently say updates often come to iPhone users first, even for some of Google’s own apps. So, the slight advantage here goes to the iPhone.

Now onto category six: Excitement. This one’s more subjective but still relevant. Personally, I get excited about various new tech innovations. With only one or two iPhone releases per year, it’s easy to build hype for the new iPhone. However, Android offers a constant stream of innovations and releases.

If you’re interested in folding phones, there are more Android options than ever. Want a gaming phone, a headphone jack, or the fastest charging? That’s the world of Android! With each iPhone launch, excitement often revolves around whether it will finally catch up to features that Android has had for years—like USB-C.

For novelty alone, the excitement category definitely goes to Android.

Finally, we come to category seven: Ecosystem. There are many who won’t buy a phone if it doesn’t have iMessage or FaceTime. Apple has built a robust ecosystem, but they’re not the only ones. Samsung has a variety of devices that create its own ecosystem, such as the Galaxy S flagship, Galaxy Buds, Galaxy Watch, and Galaxy Tab.

On paper, Samsung’s ecosystem is surprisingly congruent. Unified USB-C charging across devices and a wide array of device options provide flexibility. Yet Apple’s ecosystem stands out for its seamlessness and ease of use, with features like Continuity Camera working remarkably well.

The popularity of the Apple ecosystem—especially in the U.S.—makes its services like FaceTime and iMessage incredibly strong. Both ecosystems are solid, but at this moment, I’m giving the slight edge to Apple for its integration and continuity features.

After tallying up all the categories, you can see the iPhone is the objective winner in four out of the seven categories. But hold your pitchforks! There is no one-size-fits-all winner here, especially when options are this close. 

And if you’ve been watching my videos, you know I primarily use an Android phone alongside my iPhone. Picking one ultimate winner suggests that it’s best for everyone, but we know different features matter to different people. 

I’ve devised a basic system to help you find your personal winner. Just order the seven categories by importance to you and rate each from one to five based on how much you care about them. For me, customization and features matter most, followed by apps and excitement. Ease of use and ecosystem are less critical.

By assessing the points earned in each category, my clear winner is Android. But for you, if you value ecosystem more than anything else, the iPhone might be the perfect fit. Phone selection is deeply personal, much like buying a car.

Ultimately, purchasing a phone is one of the most personal decisions you'll make. It’s a purchase you carry everywhere, so it's natural for people to be passionate about their choices. At the end of the day, the winner is us, the consumers, because both platforms are competing to improve and win you over. That’s the way it should be.

Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.
