Okay, so I was listening to the Wired podcast this morning, and they said something that really nailed the way I think about a lot of emerging technologies, especially AI. What they said was that WWDC, which we just had from Apple, basically proved that AI is a feature, not a product. This hit hard for me because that's the exact question we've been asking ourselves for so long here about new technologies: Is it a feature or a product?

I'll give you an example. Do you remember Clubhouse? We've talked about this before, but back during the pandemic era, Clubhouse experienced a meteoric rise to success. It was a platform for live audio stage events that would disappear after they were over. That was kind of all it was—super simple, but with everyone sitting at home, it blew up in popularity. It skyrocketed to the top of the App Store. Everyone started using it. Major interviews happened on it, and new weekly shows were created. Huge famous people regularly participated in Clubhouse.

But fast forward literally one year, maybe two, and suddenly Spotify built this feature into their app, Discord built it into theirs with Stages, Slack added it, and even Twitter implemented Spaces. Suddenly, what was once a groundbreaking platform became just a feature inside larger apps. The question then became: Is Clubhouse, this huge thing that came out of nowhere, a product or just a feature? It turned out that the success of all these features in other apps led to Clubhouse's decline, along with many others. We still have Twitter Spaces, but generally, Clubhouse became a feature.

There are many examples of this, which is why the product versus feature question keeps coming up. The newest question now is: Is AI a product or a feature? We got to see what it looked like as a standalone product with devices like the Humane AI Pin, which was a dedicated piece of hardware for engaging with AI, and the Rabbit R1, another device promising to be a physical embodiment of an assistant you have everywhere. Both of these devices were not very successful, but let's assume they worked well. That would present AI as a product. You could even consider using the ChatGPT website as AI as a product.

Now, just a few months later, we had Apple's WWDC and Google I/O, which showcased a very different approach. Apple systematically added AI features throughout its operating systems. For example, within any app that can write text, you now have these writing tools powered by new language models that can help summarize, proofread, or change the tone and style of your writing. There’s also a new Siri powered by these language models, allowing for better conversations and contextual understanding. You can even generate images and emojis right from your device. The point is, it's clearly a different way of thinking about AI for consumers—it's just one of the features built into the tools you use.

I realize this isn't a perfect analogy. One flaw is that while apps like Slack and Twitter integrated audio features similar to Clubhouse, they didn't integrate Clubhouse itself; they built their own versions. Clubhouse was left to die. In Apple's case, it combines two strategies: creating their own models for many features directly on the device and also incorporating a version of ChatGPT into their OS, which ultimately gives ChatGPT more users.

I think about this a lot. There’s no clear answer yet on whether AI is a feature or a product. Will one ultimately prevail over the other? We don't know. But based on history, it seems that more people in the long run will opt for AI as a feature, rather than seeking it out as a standalone product. Looking for similar examples, it’s really hard to find cases where an individual product became significantly more successful than the same idea integrated as a feature into larger platforms.

TikTok might be the best example of the opposite, as it is a vertical video carousel with an algorithm that learns what video you want to see next. Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts have developed similar features within their respective platforms, but TikTok remains the most popular version. Another example could be Snapchat, where Stories became a major feature of the app and later appeared elsewhere, yet Snapchat continues to do well on its own.

The question now is whether you need to reach the level of Snapchat or TikTok to succeed as a standalone product in order to compete against the possibility that your idea could simply become a feature. This distinction with AI is fascinating. It also makes me think that devices like Rabbit and Humane were kind of doomed from the start, as they wouldn’t have the benefits of more powerful smartphones.

Additionally, I want to highlight something that may not have received as much attention as it deserves: all those models connected with WWDC and categorized as Apple Intelligence—the diffusion model, the image generation model, the language models—are all developed by Apple. There was confusion on Twitter about how integrated ChatGPT is into iOS. In reality, it’s not well integrated. Apple had to build and train these models from scratch, spending millions to gather public data and secure licenses.

This presents a high barrier to entry, and it’s only when requests become complex enough or require real-world data that Apple indirectly reaches out to ChatGPT, which feels quite unintegrated. Overall, this is going to be a tough situation for new companies. Unless you’re Apple, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, or other major players, you probably won’t have much of a chance in this space.

Anyway, this has been an interesting topic to explore. Is AI a product or a feature? Can it be both, or does it have to be one or the other, with a clear winner in the end?
