All right, I review a lot of products. At this point, I’ve talked about hundreds, maybe thousands of products. But for every video I’ve made, there are way more products out there in the world. The process of selecting which products to review is almost an art form in itself. Most products are just...meh. They exist and they’re fine, but they need to reach a certain level of interest or quality to be considered for a review, or sometimes they need to be really, really bad.

There’s been a lot of interesting discourse lately on this topic. A company receives some negative reviews and subsequently goes out of business, leading to the question: "Do bad reviews kill companies, or do bad products?" I have plenty of thoughts on this.

Two prominent examples that have been discussed, especially on Twitter, are my reviews of the Fisker Ocean and the Humane AI Pin. The Fisker saga was pretty well documented, but in case you missed it, I reviewed a car and had a terrible experience with it. I documented and published my review on the Auto Focus channel, and a few months later, the entire company seemed to be on life support, possibly filing for bankruptcy soon.

Now, Humane recently dropped their first product, the pin. I reviewed it, and my assessment wasn’t super positive. Many others are saying similar things, but I don’t think Humane is going anywhere. However, there is some simple logic we can apply to decipher the real danger for these companies: Do they still receive a bunch of negative reviews and die if the product is actually really good? 

Let’s take a step back for a moment. What is a review? A little pet peeve of mine is that I think people misuse or overuse that word. A review is simply when someone uses a product and shares their impressions on whether they think it’s any good and how well it actually worked. If their honest opinion is that it’s good, that’s the review. If it’s bad, that’s the review. That’s basically it. 

I’ve been an advocate of good independent reviews for what feels like forever. But the thing is, if reviews aren’t honest, they’re basically useless. I strongly believe that everything stemming from a review—the consequences and the ecosystem around it—depends on the review being truthful and honest.

I’ll share an example. Years ago, I reviewed the first Razer Phone when it was released. Razer, a gaming company, was getting into smartphones and made a phone targeting gamers. It had several upsides, like front-facing speakers and high refresh rates, but it also had downsides, such as a weak camera and a horrible vibration motor. I specifically remember calling out that the vibration motor was terrible. It sounded broken right out of the box. So, fast forward a year to the Razer Phone 2 briefing in New York City. The team showcased their new device, which had numerous improvements, including a better vibration motor. I tried it, and it was indeed much better.

That’s a big part of what reviews are about: honest feedback that leads to real action. Those who bought the first phone knew what they were getting into, and those who bought the second one benefited from the improvements. So, honesty is clearly important. 

Another aspect to consider is that these reviews are also for the people watching them. You may have been in a situation where you were about to purchase something and hopped on YouTube to check reviews to ensure you weren’t missing anything. That’s exactly how this YouTube channel started; my first tech video was reviewing a laptop I purchased with my allowance money in high school. I found a Windows Media Center remote in the PCI slot that hadn’t been mentioned in any other reviews, so I decided to create a video to inform others. 

However, not everyone watching reviews is necessarily considering buying the product. I often hear people say they watch reviews even if they aren’t planning to buy anything. Many viewers are looking for interesting, informative content. Each creator satisfies those viewers differently, which adds a layer of complexity.

Returning to the original question, can a video kill a company? I’ll use the Fisker and Humane examples. The Fisker Ocean was a terrible car, and I genuinely couldn’t wait to be done driving it. It had a multitude of problems, bugs, missing features, and safety issues. I provided a fair assessment that served as a warning not to buy this poor-quality car.

Shortly after my review, the company’s stock price plummeted to an all-time low, and they appeared to be headed for bankruptcy. The internet went wild, suggesting that my review killed the company. It’s a catchy headline, but I think it’s important to zoom out a bit. I wasn’t the only one reviewing the car; the stock had been in free fall for months before my video. Many other reviewers had also raised similar concerns over the car’s quality. 

If numerous reviewers highlight the same issues, that’s a good indicator of the honesty in their reviews. In the U.S., stocks can receive warnings if they fall below a dollar for a certain number of days in a row, and just before my video released, Fisker had received such a notice. If you’re an investor, that’s the kind of news that can seriously affect stock prices. I personally don’t pay attention to the stock price of any company whose product I review. My only focus is creating informative and honest video reviews.

Now fast forward to the Humane AI Pin. Like the Fisker Ocean, this pin has many unfulfilled promises. It doesn’t perform certain tasks well, has bad battery life, and overheats, among other issues. I tried to be as fair and informative as possible but was not about to sugarcoat or protect a company’s $700 product with a subscription model. 

Yet, some threads are surfacing, suggesting I harmed the company with my review. While it could be argued that my channel might have additional impact, I still advise zooming out. I wasn’t the first to cover the Humane Pin, nor the only one. When a product is as notable or poor as this one, many reviewers discuss their experiences and share notes. 

After reviewing a lot of bad products in my day—like the Dyson headphones, Red Hydrogen One, Pixel Slate, and HTC U Ultra—one thing has been consistently clear: bad reviews don’t kill companies without bad products being involved in the first place. I have immense respect for groups making new products. That’s the challenging part, and they create exciting things that could change the world. 

However, my reviews are not for those companies. Honest reviews simply accelerate what’s already happening. Thank you for watching, and I’ll catch you in the next one. Peace.
