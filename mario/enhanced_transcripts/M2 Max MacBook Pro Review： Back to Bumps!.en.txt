So, this is the M2 Max MacBook Pro, and let's talk about it. This week, Apple updated the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros with a press release and an 18-minute YouTube video. The video featured a bunch of creators at the beginning, which was cool, and then showcased a pre-recorded event that looked like it was cut from another presentation. In fact, it’s rumored that this was taken from an event rumored to have occurred late last year. Honestly, I believe it; the URL and the video file name contained "2022," and the AR files for the new laptops were compiled in October 2022, suggesting these products were ready months ago. But whatever, none of that matters now. What matters is that they're here, and what you need to know is that on the outside, they're basically identical, but on the inside, we have M2 Pro and M2 Max instead of M1 Pro and M1 Max, along with a few other minor improvements.

The first Apple Silicon MacBook Pros, released in October 2021, were some of the most universally praised computers I have ever encountered. They added back the ports, got rid of the touch bar, brought back MagSafe, and upgraded to an excellent high-refresh-rate mini LED display. The performance was incredible; I don’t think I’ve met a single person who got one and thought, "Oh no, I made a mistake with this one." So, when a new model comes out a year and a half later, there isn’t a ton expected to change because the big leap was from Intel MacBook Pros to Apple Silicon ones. Now we're seeing more incremental improvements.

As you can imagine, they're completely identical on the outside — same sizes, same colors. The only way I can differentiate my new one from my old 16-inch M1 Max is the custom skin I have on the back. Of course, channel sponsor dbrand is already selling skins for the 2023 model, so if you want your laptop to look a bit different from every other MacBook Pro in the world, then that’s your best bet; a link is below.

The bulk of what’s new comes from the new chip inside: M2 Pro and M2 Max. They maintain similar price tiers and configurations as before, but Apple is now quoting a 20% increase in CPU performance and a 30% increase in GPU performance. The model in front of me is a maxed out M2 Max with a 38-core GPU and the new maximum of 96GB of shared memory. Shocker — this thing is impressive.

Under the hood, it's built on a new second-generation 5 nanometer process, and they’ve added some cores: two more high-efficiency CPU cores and three more GPU cores on the Pro model, making it a 19-core GPU on the M2 Pro and a 38-core GPU on the M2 Max. Also, the neural engine and media engine have been improved to handle machine learning and media playback and transcoding even faster than before.

If you're into synthetic benchmarks, I ran Geekbench 5, and the single-core score is now the highest I’ve ever seen at just over 2,000, while the multi-core score was north of 15,000. Here's some context to help you understand how impressive these numbers are. Yes, this aligns with the 20% CPU improvement we expected. In Cinebench, it also had a chart-topping single-core score, and here’s how the multi-core performance stacks up.

Overall capabilities have been raised by 20 to 30%, which is great. But as I mentioned in my original M1 Max review a year and a half ago, it’s not just about raw processing power; it's about what those improvements allow you to do better or faster than before, hence the name “Pro.” 

I noticed this in key parts of my workflow. For example, I screen record with ScreenFlow, doing a full-resolution screen recording, then export that and bring it into Final Cut Pro. The exporting of the screen recording into ProRes 422 dramatically improved with the media engine introduced with Apple Silicon. A 16-core Intel Mac Pro with a Vega Pro II Duo, costing over $15,000, took 3.5 minutes to process a screen recording, while the M1 Max laptop did it in 32 seconds. The M2 Max managed it in just 23 seconds — a substantial improvement. Clearly, the previous machines weren't lacking, but Apple has taken everything that was good about the old ones and enhanced it, which is fantastic.

For everyday, non-demanding tasks, as you can imagine, these laptops are still excellent. I’ve already told you about the exceptional mini LED display, which has a questionable amount of light bleed but still looks great most of the time. The design is top-notch with solid metal build quality, a huge trackpad, high-quality headphone jack, and the return of the built-in SD card slot — I've covered all that. 

Now, about those other minor improvements I mentioned earlier that aren’t related to the M2 chip: First, the additional efficiency cores are great for battery life. While I’m not seeing a dramatic difference, there is a claimed extra hour on both the 14-inch and 16-inch models. The laptops still support fast charging, and there’s now a color-matching MagSafe cable. This is a slight difference, as these laptops mainly come in silver or slightly darker silver shades, but now it comes in a darker space gray to match. 

There are a few other noteworthy features as well: WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1. I was surprised HDMI 2.1 was missing in the last version, so I’m glad it's now included, allowing for up to 8K 60fps over a single cable. WiFi 6E is just starting to roll out, which will be great for future-proofing. We recently got WiFi 6E routers in the studio, and the MacBook Pros have consistently been the fastest devices on our Wi-Fi network, continuing to extend that lead. Bluetooth 5.3 is also a welcome future-proofing upgrade.

The Apple Silicon transition has come a long way since the first M1 Max, with many well-optimized apps and clearer benefits. It’s still not completely finished since we don’t have a Mac Pro yet, and it feels like they’ve neglected the iMac, which is still stuck on M1 for some reason. But overall, these laptops are a level up, and my recommendations about what to buy in the lineup remain consistent. 

If you’re focused on battery life, the M2 Pro will be fantastic. If you want maximum power at the expense of some battery life, then the M2 Max is likely your best choice. My conclusion is that these laptops aren't for those who already have M1 Pro and M1 Max laptops; they’re for people upgrading from older machines. Unless you’re one of the few who pushed their old models to their limits and needs that 30% more power, you know who you are. 

For those on older laptops, I suggest looking for sales on the M1 Pro and M1 Max because those will still be fantastic machines. 

You might have heard rumors about the first M3 laptops potentially arriving later this year on a 3-nanometer process, and you may wonder if you should wait for that. I would say, “Wait until Q3 of 2027” when the M5s come out, as they’ll be 30% faster than the M4s, which are 30% faster than the M3s — and you can see where this is going. If you’re going to wait for the next big thing, you’ll just be waiting indefinitely because that’s how technology is. 

These are great machines, and they exceed what most people need. If you can find M1s, they’ll be excellent for most users too. Either way, make sure to subscribe because I think the new M2 Mac Minis are a far more interesting machine. Stay tuned for that video. Also, I mentioned something in my last review: If the next version of this laptop still has a notch this big and doesn’t include Face ID, I’ll wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus. Surely, they must be planning to add it eventually, right? 

Well, all day today, I’m a man of my word. Thanks for watching, and catch you in the next one. Peace.
