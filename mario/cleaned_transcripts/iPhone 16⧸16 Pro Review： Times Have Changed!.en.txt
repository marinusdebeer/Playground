- [Tim] A widescreen
iPod with touch controls,
a revolutionary mobile phone,
and a breakthrough internet
communications device.
(energetic music)
(phone vibrating)
Profound new intelligence capabilities
that will make our platforms even smarter.
- So this is the iPhone 16,
and this is the iPhone 16 Pro.
Brand new, and I&amp;#39;ve been testing them
for about two weeks now.
But you know what I&amp;#39;ve been
doing way longer than two weeks?
Working on a new app that
we are finally launching.
You guys have always been asking me
where I get my wallpapers.
Like, it&amp;#39;s frequently the number
one suggested search result
under my name, has been for years.
So now we&amp;#39;ve put them all in one place.
It&amp;#39;s called Panels.
And it&amp;#39;s finally live in the App Store,
both on iOS and on Android.
Feels really good to be able to say that.
So if you&amp;#39;re wondering where
the wallpaper on these phones
in the review came from, Panels.
If you&amp;#39;re wondering where the wallpaper
in the last video came from, Panels.
Matter of fact, almost all of
the wallpapers on the devices
and in backgrounds
you&amp;#39;ve seen in my videos
for the past year have
all come from Panels,
which is pretty sick.
We have a bunch of
awesome artists over there
that we are splitting profits with 50-50.
And there&amp;#39;s already a ton
of great collections of art
and much more incoming.
And we have some pretty
big plans for this thing.
So it&amp;#39;s starting off
as a wallpaper app now.
I don&amp;#39;t want to over promise too much,
but it&amp;#39;s going to be pretty
consistently improving
over time, which is part of the reason why
we&amp;#39;re offering a
subscription to support it.
So go pick it up now.
Poke around, find your
new favorite wallpaper,
your new favorite artist, and
lemme know what you think.
It&amp;#39;s kind of fun to be
on the other side now,
on the development side,
where now other people are
gonna review what we make,
which is always exciting.
Anyway, so the meta with
new smartphones these days
is a bunch of incremental
hardware improvements
and then a whole bunch of AI features
that also are being added on top,
which is where the real value is.
And while they&amp;#39;re a
little late to the game,
Apple has hit that chapter
too with the iPhone,
whether we like it or not.
So the iPhone 16 is a minor,
minor update over the 15,
but with a ton of new AI stuff
labeled Apple Intelligence.
Except that stuff&amp;#39;s not here
yet, which is a little awkward
considering basically all of
the marketing for this phone
is Apple Intelligence stuff.
Like, I&amp;#39;ve seen billboards touting that
as the new thing here.
Their whole event was
about how it&amp;#39;s Glowtime,
which is a reference to the
new glowing Siri animation.
But none of that stuff is
on this phone, none of it.
So the only way to square the
state of this phone right now
with everything Apple
has said about this phone
is that it&amp;#39;s unfinished.
Like, this is the most unfinished
I&amp;#39;ve ever seen a new iPhone launch.
So until we actually have all
that Apple Intelligence stuff,
we are left with a very
incremental upgrade cycle.
(cheerful music)
So there&amp;#39;s not a lot
actually physically new
with this year&amp;#39;s iPhone,
but it&amp;#39;s not nothing.
So the iPhone 16 looks a little different
from the iPhone 15.
There was a moment in
time not that long ago
where Apple removed the headphone jack,
and then there was a ton of speculation
about them maybe removing all
the ports and all the buttons.
But instead it&amp;#39;s gone the opposite way
and they&amp;#39;ve added the action
button from last year&amp;#39;s Pros
and yet another button
called Camera Control,
which we&amp;#39;ll get to in a second.
Aesthetically, though,
there are some really poppy new colors
and slightly larger protruding cameras
lined up on the back of the phone.
And, okay, I know everyone
puts a case on their phone,
so this is probably nothing,
but I think this is the
wobbliest slab phone
I have ever seen, or at
least that I can remember.
But either way, the rest of the
general shape and flat sides
and dimensions of this phone
are basically the same.
It&amp;#39;s very familiar iPhone.
The Pro phones are even
harder to tell apart,
but they do have new
displays and they&amp;#39;re great.
So they&amp;#39;re slightly bigger, 6.3
and 6.9 inches respectively.
And the bezels are, I think,
actually noticeably thinner
and still even all the way around.
So both sized phones are just
a little larger than last year
and fit bigger batteries too.
And we should talk about batteries.
So when Apple unveiled
all these new phones,
they made kind of a big deal
about how they all have slightly
larger capacity batteries
across the board, and that the new Pro Max
would have the longest battery
life ever in an iPhone.
Which I mean, I would hope that
your newest, most expensive,
most high tech, biggest phone
ever has the longest battery,
but still, they didn&amp;#39;t give
any numbers to support that.
So we don&amp;#39;t actually know
how much larger in
milliamp-hours the battery is
or how much longer the
battery actually lasts.
All I have to go on is Apple&amp;#39;s
website&amp;#39;s comparison tool,
which only measures in
video playback hours.
So it has the iPhone 16 at
22 hours of video playback
up from 20, and the 16 Pro Max
is all the way up to 33 hours
versus last year&amp;#39;s big phone&amp;#39;s 29.
Unfortunately, this means
almost nothing to me
because video playback can be optimized
with like, cores on a chip.
Who cares?
But now the phones are out
and people have gotten them
and torn &amp;#39;em apart, measured &amp;#39;em.
Turns out the batteries are
about 6% larger across the board
and 9% larger on the Pro.
And I&amp;#39;ve found battery life
about the same as last year,
to be honest.
Like, not noticeably better,
not noticeably worse.
I end up saying a lot of
the same things about it,
like it lasts me a whole day on the Pro,
heavy use, no problem.
What actually did make a
difference to me, though,
is faster charging.
Less people are talking about it,
but all of the new iPhone 16 lineup
supports up to 45 watt wired charging now.
Apple never talks about fast charging,
they never brag about like,
how fast you can go 0%
to 100% or 0% to 80%,
but when their phones do get
slightly faster at charging,
it&amp;#39;s pretty nice.
It&amp;#39;s too bad it doesn&amp;#39;t come
with a fast charging brick
in the box.
But I have a fast charger.
I am loving the new
fast charging in bursts.
And also MagSafe supports,
with the new puck,
up to 25 watt wireless
charging instead of 15.
On the inside, these phones
have the A18 and A18 Pro chips.
And again, I&amp;#39;d be lying if I told you
I just noticed any
difference right out the box
and I think basically anybody would.
But yes, they will benchmark
10%, 20%, 30% faster
depending on what you ask it to do.
But the extra power is definitely
more about fringe activities,
high-end stuff, future-proofing.
I was actually more curious, though,
to find that all of the models
have eight gigs of RAM now.
So the Pro phones and the non-Pro phones,
which usually have different amounts.
No doubt this is because the
Apple Intelligence features,
when they eventually ship,
are going to need every last bit of it.
But for now, hey, you can enjoy more RAM
for all your other apps too.
IOS 18 launched with these new phones too.
So I made an entire
separate video about iOS 18,
all the new features.
That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s rolling out
to everybody&amp;#39;s older
iPhones as well now too.
So you can put your home
screen icons wherever,
you can color your home screen icons,
you can change your lock screen shortcuts,
basically customize the iPhone
a bit more than ever before.
You could argue this makes a
bigger difference to the iPhone
than any of the other hardware stuff.
But yeah, I&amp;#39;ll link that full video below.
But speaking of new hardware,
there is one other new button.
(energetic music)
So I guess nobody at Apple is
allowed to call it a button,
but I&amp;#39;m gonna call it a button.
So this is the new Camera Control button
on all of the new iPhone 16&amp;#39;s.
I&amp;#39;ve used and played with
and thought a lot about this button.
And actually, it all comes down to
smartphone cameras in general.
My take is that smartphone
cameras are like headphones&amp;#39; EQ.
Like, you get a new pair
of headphones out the box
and you listen to &amp;#39;em, you don&amp;#39;t like &amp;#39;em,
oh no, no, don&amp;#39;t worry.
That&amp;#39;s just one of the ways
that these headphones can sound.
You can change the EQ
and it&amp;#39;ll sound like a totally
different pair of headphones.
And that&amp;#39;s also true
with smartphone cameras,
this year more than ever with the iPhone.
So the default photos from the iPhone
look more iPhoney than ever.
Remember how every year in the
blind smartphone camera test
the iPhone loses
because it kind of overly
brightens all the shadows
and it doesn&amp;#39;t have as much contrast?
Yeah, it&amp;#39;s still doing that,
especially in photos with people in it.
But the purpose of this new
button has been made very clear
and it&amp;#39;s kind of a theme
for the whole phone,
which is, well, camera control.
This year, Apple&amp;#39;s kind
of just giving back
control of the camera to
users in an interesting way.
But you have to know how to use it.
Like, you have to know that
it&amp;#39;s a double half press
with just the right weight
to bring up the sliding
menu of camera controls
for things like exposure compensation
and zoom and photographic styles and tone.
And then play with it enough to realize
that tone is actually maybe
the most important one,
where turning up tone actually
removes shadows even more
but turning down tone
brings real shadows back.
But it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have a memory,
so you have to remember to set it
every time you open the camera app.
But you also have this D-pad
that lets you change even
more elements of a photo,
including undertones and mood and color
and really mess around
and dial in the look
of the photos you want.
And this one does have memory,
so every subsequent
time you open the camera
it&amp;#39;ll remember your color hue and tone.
So I found that tone at
around -0.5 is a nice balance
for most photos that I&amp;#39;ve been taking.
Feels less flat, more contrasty.
This is all really useful to me.
And combined with the actual
new cameras on the phones,
this has risen the iPhone back to the top
of my personal favorite rankings
of smartphones to shoot with.
I just like having more
control over the camera.
Camera control.
But it is really finicky.
Like, the placement on the side
of the phone for the button
is mostly ideal for landscape,
but would definitely be easier to reach
if it was closer to the corner.
But if we&amp;#39;re being honest,
most people take photos and
videos in portrait these days
and the corner would be
horrible for portrait,
so they split the difference
and moved it up a bit
so you could reach it.
But it&amp;#39;s still not great.
And the half press
sensitivity takes some time
to really get used to.
I&amp;#39;m on week three now,
and I&amp;#39;m still accidentally taking pictures
by tapping too hard.
And the scrolling, it has momentum physics
and you can accidentally scroll too far
and go past the thing you were targeting
in this more continuous
scrolling interface.
It is just finicky enough
and just hidden enough
that I honestly think like,
99% of people will never use this
for anything other than just
a camera shutter button.
And I guess that&amp;#39;s fine too.
I personally did quickly get used to
opening the camera quickly
with the Camera Control button.
And so I remapped my action button
to something else, my Tasks app.
And I&amp;#39;ve also remapped
my lock screen shortcut
so it&amp;#39;s now flashlight
and my Tasks app again.
And you can always just
swipe over sideways
from the lock screen and
get to the stock camera app.
So if you really want, you can
map the Camera Control button
to open any other camera
app on your phone,
or just keep waiting for
Apple Intelligence features
that this will probably
make more sense for.
So yeah, long story
short, one, it&amp;#39;s a button.
Two, it&amp;#39;s also a customization slider.
Three, it&amp;#39;s just gonna be
a button for most people.
But also four, there are
new cameras on the back.
(bright music)
So there&amp;#39;s a bunch of new
cameras across the line
for both iPhone 16 and 16 Pro.
Best way to summarize it,
okay, so iPhone 16&amp;#39;s cameras are nice,
like they&amp;#39;re pretty solid main cameras,
very much in character
with iPhones of the past
but not noticeably better
than previous years.
And then the 16 Pro cameras
with the much bigger main sensor
and the higher resolution
ultrawide and the 5X telephoto
are a significant step up, in my opinion.
The main camera I think is
my favorite primary sensor
in any smartphone to shoot with right now.
It&amp;#39;s really good at basically everything.
The ultrawide is also better,
but kind of only in
detail during the daytime
since it&amp;#39;s a 48 megapixel sensor now.
But the sensor&amp;#39;s not bigger enough
to matter at night, though.
And now my night ultrawides
all look kind of
vignetted for some reason.
I mean, look at that, it
looks like I added a filter.
But then the 5X telephoto on
both the Pros is also nice now.
And there is some chatter
about it being worse
at the 3X to 4X range
because you&amp;#39;re still
having to do digital zoom.
And technically that&amp;#39;s true,
but I find the 5X to be
a pretty useful zoom.
And it&amp;#39;s also better at
resolving all the detail past 5X
than before, even without AI.
Shutter speeds are super fast
and freeze action better than ever before.
This is kind of underrated,
but I love this.
Like, this shot came from a
moving car at highway speed,
and so did this one, so that&amp;#39;s sick.
And the ease at which you can
get a shallow depth of field
with a closeup subject
is on par with any other
big sensor Android flagship
like S24 Ultra or Pixel 9 Pro.
And no, Apple has absolutely
not fixed the lens flare issue
with point lights at night.
So for those who are wondering, sorry.
But aside from that,
video is very impressive.
I&amp;#39;ll be publishing the
next Auto Focus video
on the Silverado EV
pickup truck pretty soon,
so subscribe over there
for that, first of all.
But that&amp;#39;s gonna be shot
entirely on iPhone 16 Pro
and I&amp;#39;ve been very happy with it.
And Apple also added a 4K 120
FPS mode to the Pro phones,
and it&amp;#39;s sick.
It looks great.
It is really convenient to shoot and edit.
The only thing you gotta
be careful with is storage,
&amp;#39;cause it can really eat up storage.
Like, you can get up
to near a gig a minute
and that&amp;#39;s before you even do
4K 120 ProRes or ProRes Log.
But yeah, I still love shooting it anyway.
It also proves to me that
they have the processing power
and the sensor readout speed to do 8K 30,
they just choose not to.
And I wonder why sometimes.
This is also the first year
they&amp;#39;re using the term Fusion camera.
And you kinda have to dig in a little bit
to try to figure out what that means.
Turns out it&amp;#39;s basically the
same thing as last year&amp;#39;s,
like, punch-in optical quality zoom,
but with a slightly updated
image processing pipeline.
Cool.
But also that zoom
is not technically
one-to-one optical quality
because the photo sights are
smaller in that smaller crop.
Nevertheless, iPhone 16 camera, good.
iPhone 16 Pro camera, great.
(upbeat music)
There is something truly
weird about this product
being launched at an Apple
event called Glowtime
and not launching with the
thing that glows, the new Siri.
There&amp;#39;s something weird about people
happily going out to a 5th
Avenue Apple store this week
which is literally
glowing with rainbows now,
and walking out with a brand new phone
that doesn&amp;#39;t have that.
Like, there&amp;#39;s something just off
about billboards and marketing material
all highlighting Apple Intelligence,
and Tim Cook saying
this was the first phone
built from the ground up
for Apple Intelligence.
- The next generation of
iPhone has been designed
for Apple Intelligence from the ground up.
- Yet this phone does not have
Apple Intelligence at all.
It&amp;#39;s all coming soon and
coming later this year
and into next year eventually
with software updates.
But if I&amp;#39;ve said it once,
I&amp;#39;ve said it a million times,
never buy a product based on the promise
of future software updates.
Buy it for what it is
right now when you buy it.
That&amp;#39;s been the golden rule for forever.
But yet here we are, times have changed.
This has been a common trend alongside AI.
And you think Apple might be
immune to it, but they&amp;#39;re not.
They&amp;#39;re a public company.
And just like lots of
other public companies,
they&amp;#39;ve sort of caved to this pressure
that they have to appear
like an AI-first, AI-forward
company, like a leader in AI.
So they have presented a ton of AI stuff
that they&amp;#39;re working on, and
they&amp;#39;ve done the song and dance
of like, &amp;quot;Hey, we&amp;#39;re AI-first
and the phone&amp;#39;s built
from the ground up for AI.
It&amp;#39;s our whole theme this year.&amp;quot;
But the fact of the matter
is it&amp;#39;s not good yet.
It&amp;#39;s not.
It&amp;#39;s actually not even finished.
If it was, they&amp;#39;d be shipping it.
But it&amp;#39;s in beta and
they&amp;#39;re still working on it
and they&amp;#39;d rather keep working on it
than ship it to you now.
So how do we square this?
Do we even square this?
You remember the Rabbit R1.
The Rabbit was a little AI in a box,
pretty classic 2024 product.
When I reviewed that Rabbit,
it was basically useless,
like literally almost none of
the functionality was working
as it shipped.
And so I said so in the review.
Same with the Humane AI Pin,
really, really, really bad product
missing almost all of its functionality.
Worst product I&amp;#39;ve ever reviewed for now.
Both of those products have
started to get some updates
since I reviewed them.
But again, I can only review
what&amp;#39;s in front of me,
like I got that thing in the mail
just like real customers
are gonna get that thing in the mail,
and now it feels like the new iPhone
is suddenly in the same boat.
So I guess the difference
between the Rabbit and the
Humane Pin and the iPhone is,
well, one, the iPhone is
a fine standalone product
even without the promised stuff.
And it&amp;#39;s viable and usable,
where the other two, not so much.
But two is that Apple at
least now has some element
of a track record of
developing and shipping things
that they promised, where
Humane and Rabbit didn&amp;#39;t.
So you could argue there&amp;#39;s
some dimension of trust to this
and that Apple is really leaning heavily
on how much you trust them.
Because to be honest,
to me it&amp;#39;s really bold
to be shipping the product
like this without any
of these big things that you&amp;#39;re promising.
Like, they must really
believe in themselves
to eventually ship this stuff
so that people aren&amp;#39;t mad.
But yeah, that&amp;#39;s the AI
world we live in, I guess,
is that everyone has this pressure
to feel like a leader in AI
and be shipping all these
new features and stuff.
But a lot of it, not that
good yet, not that done yet.
So I&amp;#39;m planning an entire separate review
of Apple Intelligence as
a whole when it comes out.
I&amp;#39;ve been using some of
the features in 18.1 Beta
on my 15 Pro, but even
this is really limited.
Like, it&amp;#39;s basically just writing tools
and the new Siri animation.
But they have a long way to go.
I&amp;#39;ll say get subscribed
to see the Apple Intelligence
review when it drops,
when it&amp;#39;s done,
because clearly it&amp;#39;s a
big part of this phone.
(bright music)
So you made it this far into the video,
or you skipped ahead to this chapter
&amp;#39;cause you just really wanted an answer
on if you should buy these phones or not.
Fine either way.
So okay, you should buy the iPhone 16
if you&amp;#39;re on an iPhone 13 or older
and you know, that phone
is on its last legs
and you&amp;#39;re really looking for
an upgrade to a new iPhone.
Fine.
Anything newer
and it probably won&amp;#39;t feel
like it&amp;#39;s worth an upgrade.
And you should buy the iPhone 16 Pro
if you really want a better
phone in cameras or displays.
That&amp;#39;s really the two places
where the Pro shines
over the regular phone.
The cheap iPhone really has
never looked better, honestly.
It has the Camera Control,
it matches the RAM of
the more expensive Pros,
it has the more interesting
colors if you&amp;#39;re into that.
It has the action button now too.
And it has the same
brightness of the display
and it also goes all
the way down to one nit,
just like the Pro screen.
Now, I personally cannot use
a 60 hertz, $800 phone in 2024.
I just can&amp;#39;t do it.
And there are lots of people just like me
who will immediately have
to upgrade to the Pro
just for that.
But there are also tons of
people who don&amp;#39;t even notice
or care about ProMotion.
Which, I know, it&amp;#39;s kinda hard
to wrap my head around too.
But for those people, yeah,
the base phone is gonna be great.
But then as someone who shoots
a lot of photos and videos
and you know, social media
stuff, the Auto Focus channel,
between all that,
the cameras are better enough on the Pros
for that to be worth the upgrade for me.
But yeah, I still say buy
it for what it is today,
not for what it could be tomorrow.
And even without any of the AI stuff
maybe ever coming to these
phones, they&amp;#39;re still rock solid,
very, very incremental upgrades.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you guys in the next one.
Peace.
(bright music)
