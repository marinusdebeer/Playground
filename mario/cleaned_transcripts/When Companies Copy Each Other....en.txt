(subtle groovy music)
- So, this is the Apple Watch Ultra.
It was added in at the top
of the Apple Watch lineup
for an extra premium
price, kinda as an excuse
to pack a much bigger
battery in a smartwatch,
but also, to offer a few
extra ruggedized features
for enthusiasts willing
to spend the extra money.
Now, this is the Samsung
Galaxy Watch Ultra,
and it was added to the top
of the Galaxy Watch lineup
for an extra premium
price, kinda as an excuse
to pack a much bigger
battery into a smartwatch,
but also to offer a few
extra ruggedized features
for enthusiasts willing
to spend the money.
Now look, there have
been many copies before,
in both directions.
Like, Samsung copies Apple all the time,
and Apple copies Samsung all the time.
But this one is so far
that it&amp;#39;s hard to ignore.
So, there&amp;#39;s been a lot of chatter online,
about how the New Galaxy Watch Ultra
is a copycat product of
the Apple Watch Ultra.
And yeah, it&amp;#39;s true, it really is.
But I&amp;#39;ve said this before
and I&amp;#39;ll say it again.
I actually don&amp;#39;t care
that these products and
companies copy each other.
As long as they&amp;#39;re copying the good stuff,
then, us as customers,
we actually still win.
This one copied so many things
that it actually went slightly too far
and copied one extra thing
that I think hurt its case.
So, let&amp;#39;s just go down the list.
So, first of all, obviously
they had the same name,
and the whole idea of the product,
as I mentioned before,
this is the Watch Ultra.
It&amp;#39;s at the top of the lineup,
it&amp;#39;s the most expensive,
and of course, they&amp;#39;ve matched
the Apple Watch Ultra&amp;#39;s durability specs,
so they&amp;#39;re both made of titanium,
they&amp;#39;re both water-resistant
to 100 meters,
they both have sapphire glass
over their cover displays.
And then, the other basic on-paper specs,
like they both have dual-frequency
GPS for high accuracy,
they both have extra bright displays
for visibility outdoors,
actually both 3,000 nits,
and then they both have
three default bands.
So, the Apple Watch
Ultra has an Ocean Band,
a Trail Loop, and an Alpine Band.
So now, along comes Samsung&amp;#39;s Watch Ultra,
and they launch with three bands.
They don&amp;#39;t have an Ocean Band though,
they have a Marine
Band, totally different.
And then they have a Trail Band,
and then they have this Peakform Band.
So yeah, the Ocean Band
and the Marine Band
are kinda like, &amp;quot;Hey,
can I copy your homework,
but change it up just a little bit
so it&amp;#39;s not too obvious that I copied?&amp;quot;
And they kinda didn&amp;#39;t change it up enough.
But it&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;Okay,
yeah, sweet, thanks.&amp;quot;
Now we have two holes
on ours instead of one,
and everybody knows not every
marine is an ocean, duh.
But each watch has three buttons,
and you may remember the Apple Watch
added this special
orange button on the side
called the Action Button,
that you could map to any
number of different things.
But it starts with a
workout selector by default.
Now, the Galaxy Watch Ultra comes along,
has a new orange button on the side.
This one is called the Quick Button,
and it can be also custom mapped
to any number of different actions,
but the default again,
is a workout selector.
Now, don&amp;#39;t worry, it keeps going.
In the software department,
they also lifted a whole bunch of stuff.
So, this watch face that we
keep seeing Samsung using
in all of their flagship
marketing for this thing,
with all the complications
around the outside corners,
definitely takes heavy inspiration
from Apple&amp;#39;s flagship watch face
with the complications everywhere.
It also has an all monochrome
version for Night Mode,
which was also new to
the Apple Watch Ultra.
And if you wanna change the watch face,
they both have the same mechanic.
Just hold down the face for a second,
and then swipe over and you
can customize the complications
or watch faces from there.
They both use a blob of icons
to scroll through all of your apps,
and even the double-pinch gesture.
So, this is something
Apple recently added.
It was in beta at first
and now it&amp;#39;s operational,
and Samsung&amp;#39;s added it now too.
It&amp;#39;s off by default,
but when I turn it on,
it does the exact same things.
So yeah, as you can tell,
there&amp;#39;s no shortage of things
that Samsung has lifted
from the Apple Watch Ultra.
People are calling it shameless,
people are calling it
pure copycat behavior.
There&amp;#39;s endless comments online about it.
Here&amp;#39;s the thing though,
there&amp;#39;s only one thing that Samsung copied
that I actually have a
problem with with this watch.
Like, when you just look at this watch,
you can definitely argue it actually looks
mostly different from the Apple Watch.
I mean I know they both
have the orange button,
but they&amp;#39;ve done this kinda unique thing,
where it&amp;#39;s still a fully
circular watch face,
but then it&amp;#39;s a much bigger, brawny,
circle-shaped titanium body underneath,
I call it a cushion design.
That&amp;#39;s at least different.
And I don&amp;#39;t know if I
actually like it more,
but it feels definitively bigger
than the Apple Watch Ultra,
which was already pretty big.
But in the grand scheme of
watches, it&amp;#39;s not actually huge,
especially &amp;#39;cause the size of the screen
is basically the same as a large Watch7.
Anyway, I thought that with
keeping this circular screen,
they would have a
physically rotating bezel,
like a clicking bezel on the outside,
because that was the sickest
feature on the Watch6 Classic,
and it&amp;#39;s the feature everyone wanted
in all the other watches,
but they just didn&amp;#39;t do it.
This watch though, is just pure
touchscreen for everything,
which might not seem like
that big of a deal at first,
but again, this is a
watch for fitness people
doing a lot of workouts
and things like that,
and if you&amp;#39;ve used watches
in all these workout situations
before, then you know,
like there are endless
situations where like,
sweat or your sleeve is
messing with the touchscreen,
or if you&amp;#39;ve got gloves on,
or if you&amp;#39;re hiking or you&amp;#39;re
underwater or swimming,
whatever, there&amp;#39;s just plenty of chances
for the touchscreen to suck.
So, the rotating crown
to use as a selector
to mess with the watch,
would have been a banger differentiator
for this fitness watch
versus the Apple Watch Ultra,
but they didn&amp;#39;t do it.
Now, I&amp;#39;m guessing, if you
asked Samsung, they would say,
&amp;quot;No rotating bezel on this watch,
because that&amp;#39;s a moving part,
and that wouldn&amp;#39;t have held up
to the military-grade certification
of the rest of the watch.&amp;quot;
Like, it&amp;#39;s got this 810H
grade military certification,
where it&amp;#39;s like, it can
withstand even tougher drops,
and like more dust
and wider range of temperatures
and all that stuff,
so, the moving part wouldn&amp;#39;t
have worked with that.
But honestly, Samsung, I
think just do it anyway.
Just go with the rotating bezel.
I think 99% of users
would rather have the rotating bezel
over the military certification,
and the 1% who don&amp;#39;t like,
they&amp;#39;ll get a Garmin or
whatever, something different,
but I think this is something
that would&amp;#39;ve actually been a great match
with this particular watch.
Now, there&amp;#39;s a few other
things now that I&amp;#39;ve used it
that do differentiate this watch too.
Obviously, it&amp;#39;s gonna
be the one that works
with Android phones and not
iPhones, that&amp;#39;s number one.
But where OS performs really well,
I know there was some early concerns
about it not being super
smooth, but it&amp;#39;s been great.
It&amp;#39;s very customizable, very functional.
The full-size keyboard
is actually a bit easier to type on,
despite having a bigger screen,
because they make the letters bigger,
and then you have to go into
a secondary menu for symbols.
But I actually feel like I can type words
pretty well on this versus
other smart watches.
And I think best of all,
the battery life has actually
lived up to its claims.
So, sometimes it&amp;#39;s hard to know
what to make of the 60 hours
versus 100 hours in Power-Saving Mode,
or 48 hours in Exercise Power-Saving Mode.
It&amp;#39;s kind of confusing,
but what I will say is,
it matched and sometimes beat
the battery life of the Apple Watch Ultra,
like pretty regularly.
I felt like it has about
a 25% better standby time,
so if you have light use,
you&amp;#39;re just casually like
getting text messages,
doing one or two workouts,
you can easily get two
full days outta this watch.
And then if you&amp;#39;re going heavy,
if it&amp;#39;s a bunch of workouts,
then it&amp;#39;s closer to even,
but it&amp;#39;s still a solid day and a half,
especially when you&amp;#39;re using
that 3,000 nit Super AMOLED Display a lot.
That&amp;#39;s impressive.
So, yeah, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear
that Samsung has copied
a lot of features and things
about the Apple Watch Ultra,
but as I&amp;#39;ve kept saying,
if you copy the good stuff,
then you can still end
up with a great product,
no matter how shameless it is.
But the conclusion about
this one is kind of funny,
because Samsung also updated
the Watch7 at the same time,
and that watch also
has dual-frequency GPS,
the screen is the same size,
even though it&amp;#39;s a smaller battery,
it&amp;#39;s still got sapphire crystal on top,
it&amp;#39;s got three sporty bands
and it&amp;#39;s like half the price.
So, that ends up making this one
feel harder to recommend
if it&amp;#39;s so similar.
So, this just ends up being a Galaxy Watch
for people who want that,
but with a bigger battery,
and I guess just a little
more ruggedized features,
and that&amp;#39;s kind of it,
and you have $650 you&amp;#39;re
willing to spend on it.
So, I think the rotating
bezel would&amp;#39;ve been
easier to justify and like separate them,
but yeah, for now, this is
one of those Samsung products
that&amp;#39;s a little more
shameless in its inspiration,
and it won&amp;#39;t be the last one,
from either side.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you guys to the next one.
Peace.
