(upbeat music)
- So we just got done with
possibly one of the biggest
Apple WWDC keynotes of all time, maybe,
just because of the state of the world
and what everyone expects
from tech companies in 2024,
which is AI at the front of what you do.
Interestingly, with Apple this time,
Apple had AI at the back
half of what they did.
Literally, the entire
first half of the keynote,
they didn&amp;#39;t say AI once, zero times.
Then the second hour,
they basically just went,
&amp;quot;All right, yeah, we, we actually do have
a lot of AI stuff to share with you.&amp;quot;
And they just spit it all out.
And of course they did manage to brand it
because of course they did.
AI for them is now Apple Intelligence.
But look, I watched and live tweeted
the entire two-hour long
keynote so you don&amp;#39;t have to.
And I&amp;#39;ve gathered all my thoughts
on all the most important announcements,
so this is everything you
need to know that&amp;#39;s new
and some of my takes on it.
So I&amp;#39;m gonna go in the
same order that Apple went.
I&amp;#39;m gonna start with VisionOS,
and we&amp;#39;re already on,
somehow, VisionOS 2.0
less than half a year after the Vision Pro
first got announced.
And there are some solid new features,
but I don&amp;#39;t know if I
would call this 2.0 worthy.
It feels more like a 1.2 update,
but, okay, whatever, we&amp;#39;ll go with it.
So there&amp;#39;s a new wrist turn gesture
to quickly see the time and
your battery percentage,
and then you can jump right from there
into the control center,
instead of having to look
way up at the ceiling
like you had to before every time.
It kinda reminds me of the Oculus Quest.
That is easy. That&amp;#39;s an upgrade.
There&amp;#39;s a bunch of
immersive media features,
like they let you go
through your old photos
and use advanced machine learning
to turn them into spatial photos,
which is really interesting if it works.
And there are also new
tools to help people create
spatial videos and immersive videos
on cameras other than the iPhone,
but then of course you can
only view them on a Vision Pro.
So who knows how valuable this
will actually turn out to be.
But then, this year, Mac mirroring
will get way more resolution
thanks to it now doing the
foveated rendering on the Mac.
So basically it frees
up a ton of resources
and it lets you do up to
double the resolution.
So you could do a gigantic
ultra wide if you want it to be.
That is way more room for
windows and activities.
Love that.
And that&amp;#39;s pretty much it.
Again, it&amp;#39;s not the biggest
2.0 update we&amp;#39;ve ever seen,
but it does feel like there&amp;#39;s
some nice updates in there,
including some new environments
and the ability to
rearrange your home screen.
Believe it or not, you
couldn&amp;#39;t do that before.
Now you can.
But speaking of rearranging
your home screen,
iOS just got one of the biggest
or at least most interesting
updates in a long time.
And I&amp;#39;m just gonna...
If you&amp;#39;re an Android user,
I&amp;#39;d say for the next like
two minutes, three minutes,
just go ahead and unplug
your keyboard for a second
and just relax.
&amp;#39;Cause yes, we&amp;#39;ve had these
features for a long time,
but now it&amp;#39;s the iPhone&amp;#39;s
time to shine, all right?
So, officially, you will
finally be able to put icons
wherever you want on the
iOS 18 home screen grid.
And it was hilarious that this got
a whole applause moment from
the audience during the keynote
as if they just invented a new feature.
But fine, you&amp;#39;ve been waiting
for a long time for this.
Have your fun.
But they didn&amp;#39;t stop there.
They added a whole bunch of
other customization features
to the iPhone home screen too,
and it started to get a
little more interesting.
See, there&amp;#39;s this new theme engine now
that lets you go in and change the color
of every icon and widget
on your home screen
to the same color.
So you can match your wallpaper
with your icons to frame it nicely
and have matching colors everywhere.
It&amp;#39;s a simple thing
and we&amp;#39;ve been doing it on
Android with launchers for years,
but the thing about these is,
before this moment,
basically every iPhone home
screen looked the same.
We&amp;#39;ve been saying that.
They&amp;#39;ve just given you
the ability to go crazy
and kind of ruin your home
screen if you want to,
and people seem to absolutely want to.
I have seen some rough home screens
people are making on Twitter.
A lot of them just look terrible.
And I think the main thing
I noticed is it seems like
there are apps that support
this whole colored thing well,
and then there are apps that don&amp;#39;t,
that just looks like
it tints the entire...
It just literally applies a color cast
to the entire icon on your home screen,
which causes all kinds
of legibility problems.
Doesn&amp;#39;t look good.
There are widgets that look horrible.
It&amp;#39;s just unreadable.
So yeah, you can make some pretty-looking
home screens if you want,
but you can also make some
really ugly looking home screens.
And I was trying to decide
if I like this more or
less than what Google did
on the Pixels with Material You
I think, technically, it&amp;#39;s better
because it works on all of the icons.
I don&amp;#39;t know how many setups I&amp;#39;ve tried
where I wanna do the monochrome icons,
but there are just a few of
my apps that aren&amp;#39;t supported,
so they end up looking kind of,
like they stick out like a sore thumb.
So at least Apple&amp;#39;s is letting you change
all of the icons at once.
But anyway, Apple&amp;#39;s also
redesigned the Control Center
to be fully customizable
across multiple pages.
So again, there&amp;#39;s a
lot more going on here,
and there are many more
customizable shortcuts in more places,
including finally replacing
the flashlight and camera
on the home screen without
jail breaking, finally.
And the list keeps going.
Stop me if you&amp;#39;ve heard these before,
but you can do hidden apps
now inside your app drawer.
So you can lock apps into a hidden folder
that makes it easier than ever
to hide Tinder from your wife.
There&amp;#39;s also scheduled
text messages in iMessage.
Great, finally, they&amp;#39;re
having some fun over there.
There&amp;#39;s also text formatting.
There&amp;#39;s messages via satellite.
RCS support was very casually
but briefly mentioned.
The Photos app is redesigned.
There&amp;#39;s also a game mode
that now minimizes background activity
and minimizes Bluetooth
latency for peripherals.
Great.
And a new automatic categorization
in the new Mail app.
So you can tell, there&amp;#39;s
been a whole bunch of stuff.
I will definitely be doing a larger,
more focused just iOS 18 video,
so you can see everything that&amp;#39;s new.
There&amp;#39;s plenty of little stuff
that didn&amp;#39;t make it into the keynote,
so I&amp;#39;ll do a whole deep
dive just for that.
Make sure you subscribe to be
among the first to see that.
I believe we are catching
up to Apple in subscribers.
It&amp;#39;d be kind of nice if we pass them.
That&amp;#39;d be sick.
So then AirPods got minor updates,
like voice isolation during phone calls,
spatial audio during games,
and the ability to respond to a prompt
just by nodding or shaking your head,
taken right from the Sony headphones.
I kinda like it though,
controlling it without
using your voice is nice.
Then Apple TV gets this new feature
where you swipe down on the remote
at any point during a show,
and it just shows you all the actors
and character names of
the people on the screen
and any song that&amp;#39;s playing
in that moment in real time.
And there&amp;#39;s also a feature
that boosts people&amp;#39;s voices
so you can always hear
them over the music.
And then watchOS, they got
this little training mode
that sort of balances the trends
in your training over time
and evaluates how hard a workout was
versus how hard it could have been.
And then iPadOS.
So this was supposed to
be Apple&amp;#39;s big chance
to really convince us that the iPad,
it&amp;#39;s something special that&amp;#39;s
got a little something to it
that would make us convinced
that we&amp;#39;d wanna get the newest one,
the M4 one that just came out
over just your phone or over a Mac.
And I&amp;#39;ll say it did get
one incredible feature,
but it didn&amp;#39;t really
do much more than that.
So the iPad it, it gets all the stuff
I talked about with the iPhone, right?
Full home screen customization,
customizable Control Center,
the new Photos app, et cetera.
It&amp;#39;s all great.
There&amp;#39;s also a feature in SharePlay
that lets you go in and actually
remotely control someone&amp;#39;s
iPad when they allow it,
which seems like a small thing,
but I promise you that is
massive for family tech support.
You know who you are.
But the one massive actually
impressive new feature
on the iPad in iPadOS 18,
and you think I&amp;#39;m joking,
but I&amp;#39;m dead serious when I say this.
It&amp;#39;s the Calculator app.
It&amp;#39;s the new calculator.
I promise you I was so
ready to dunk on this.
I had a tweet drafted up as
they were talking about it.
We finally brought the
calculator to the iPad,
and there were screenshots of it,
and it looked just like the iPhone app.
And I was like, &amp;quot;Really?
This is what you were so hyped about?&amp;quot;
I had that clip queued up ready
of Craig Federighi being like,
&amp;quot;Yes, we had to do something super special
to finally bring that
calculator to the iPad.&amp;quot;
But then they pulled the
Apple pencil off the side
and they pulled up
what&amp;#39;s called Math Notes,
and it was pretty sick.
So now, on the iPad, you
can actually write down
equations in handwriting,
and it will understand what you wrote,
and it&amp;#39;ll answer the question
and in your handwriting.
And then if you adjust the equation
or add new information or something,
it automatically updates the answer,
which was so sick.
I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m
so impressed with this,
but it was really cool
to play with and look at.
So if that wasn&amp;#39;t impressive enough,
it also supports variables.
So you can have variables
written all over the page.
So look at this.
It has G, and X, and A, and H,
and then it&amp;#39;s labeled
Y as the height here.
So you can ask for an equation
using these variables,
and it can give you an answer.
And if you want, you can
do a y equals equation,
and it&amp;#39;ll give you a graph
with real time adjustment
of any of the variables in your equation.
I mean, I wish I was in sixth grade again,
so this could be my full-time calculator.
This is sick.
Now, at this point in the keynote,
they haven&amp;#39;t even actually said
the word AI a single time yet.
I think this is pretty clearly AI.
This is like handwriting recognition.
This is like semantic understanding
of all the things happening on the page.
It&amp;#39;s good AI.
Well played, Craig, you did it, okay,
but this is before the actual AI section.
But also this wasn&amp;#39;t mentioned on stage,
but this is also coming to
the iPhone&amp;#39;s Calculator app as well.
But then Mac OS.
Mac OS has its newest version.
It&amp;#39;s called Sequoia,
and it does also get a nice
little grab bag of new features.
There&amp;#39;s automatic window
snapping now finally built in.
You don&amp;#39;t need a third
party app to do it anymore.
Sherlocked.
There&amp;#39;s built in backgrounds for any app
that uses the webcam feed.
There&amp;#39;s also a new password
app that basically just takes
what was buried in the settings before
and just makes it its own standalone app.
So it&amp;#39;s actually on Mac,
iPad, and the iPhone.
But probably the biggest
thing is iPhone Mirroring.
So this is another continuity feature
that basically just lets you
wirelessly always see
your iPhone on your Mac.
It merges your notifications
and audio with your Mac
and lets you drag and
drop things back and forth
between your phone that&amp;#39;s
sitting next to you and your Mac.
I kinda wonder if this
hits your phone battery
harder than normal.
They didn&amp;#39;t really say, obviously,
so I&amp;#39;m gonna have to test this.
But I imagine if you&amp;#39;re just
sitting on a wireless charger,
then it won&amp;#39;t matter.
But I&amp;#39;ll be checking that out.
But then we arrived.
They did all the sections
with all the other operating systems,
and now we got to the part
where Apple&amp;#39;s gonna talk
about AI stuff, kind of.
Now, I don&amp;#39;t know if you remember this,
but a couple months
ago, not that long ago,
I did an entire video
on all of these phrases
that it seems like Apple
refused to say on stage.
They just would not say &amp;#39;em,
and AI is one of them.
They just didn&amp;#39;t say it.
They&amp;#39;d say anything else,
neural nets, machine learning,
all sorts of other things like that,
But the times of the times,
people wanna hear Apple talk about AI.
So they finally did.
And they also, like I said,
they rebranded it just for themselves
to just commander the AI name.
And so now it&amp;#39;s called Apple
Intelligence in Apple Land.
So here&amp;#39;s basically what you need to know
about Apple Intelligence, right?
So Apple has already had AI features
on their devices before.
They&amp;#39;ve had the Neural
Engine inside of their chips,
and they&amp;#39;ve done things like,
smartly cutting subjects out of photos.
They&amp;#39;ve done things like auto
complete on the keyboard.
That&amp;#39;s already existed.
But this new Apple Intelligence
is basically a bucket of
these new generative models
and what they do on your devices.
So there&amp;#39;s these new diffusion models,
generative models, and
large language models
that are all built by Apple
that bring new functionality
to the supported devices.
And actually, I&amp;#39;ll just
get that out the way,
right off the bat.
These are only supported
on the highest end versions
of currently available Apple silicon.
So that just means iPhone 15 Pro
and any iPad with M1 or later
and any Mac with M1 or later.
So what does that look like?
Well, basically starting
with these new OSs,
there&amp;#39;s a small suite of tools
that&amp;#39;s kind of sprinkled
across everything.
It&amp;#39;s not like there&amp;#39;s one
Apple Intelligence app
or something like that.
They&amp;#39;re just kind of sprinkled throughout.
So here&amp;#39;s an example, writing tools.
We all know how powerful these
large language models can be.
So anytime you&amp;#39;re writing
in pages or keynote
or basically anywhere
where there&amp;#39;s a cursor,
you can use the writing tools to summarize
or rewrite something that
you&amp;#39;ve already written.
It can change the writing
style or just proofread,
just basic useful stuff.
Here&amp;#39;s another one.
Remember the Magic Eraser
tool in Google Photos
and these Android phones that use it?
Apple&amp;#39;s finally doing that too.
Built into their own Photos
App is a Clean Up tool,
and it&amp;#39;s basically the same idea.
This will identify background items.
It&amp;#39;ll let you circle items
you don&amp;#39;t like in your photos
and just get rid of them.
Fill in the background with
generative fill, super quick.
And there&amp;#39;s also Genmojis,
generative emojis.
And this made me feel really old
&amp;#39;cause I would never use this,
but apparently there&amp;#39;s
a whole group of people
who go through searching for emojis
and then they find that
there&amp;#39;s one that doesn&amp;#39;t exist,
and they&amp;#39;re like, &amp;quot;Dang, I
wish I could just make an emoji
for this moment right now.&amp;quot;
And for those people, yeah, now you can.
You can generate a new emoji,
You can literally type
it in like a prompt,
and the diffusion model will create
that new emoji from scratch
in the style of all the other emojis.
And they had an entire thing
called the Image Playground
that&amp;#39;s built into a bunch of Apples apps,
but also has its own separate app
that lets you create these
nice little square images
with prompts in three different styles,
sketch, illustration, and animation.
And yes, there are also Siri improvements
that&amp;#39;s using the large language models
to generally understand context better
and just generally be
better and more natural at
being an assistant that isn&amp;#39;t garbage.
And later in the year,
it will also be able to
pull info from inside of apps
and take actions inside
of apps for you too.
I remember when this
was a huge Bixby feature
on Samsung phones.
So that&amp;#39;s cool to see.
Plus there&amp;#39;s also this big pretty new
full-screen animation when
you&amp;#39;re triggering Siri
to tie it all together.
Its voice is apparently slightly updated
and you can now also type to Siri
instead of talking to
it out loud every time,
which is long overdue, but also nice.
There is notes app summaries,
there is phone call summaries,
just all kinds of features
sprinkled around like I said.
I think I&amp;#39;ll end up making a video
just summarizing or testing or reviewing
all of the Apple Intelligence stuff
&amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s kind of all over the place,
but now you know what it&amp;#39;s.
But one question that&amp;#39;s been
floating around the internet is,
what stuff is happening on device
versus things that have
to go to the cloud?
And this has also come up a lot
because you might have
also heard about Apple
partnering specifically with OpenAI
to integrate ChatGPT-4.0 into
this Apple Intelligence stuff.
So it&amp;#39;s a big question
everyone&amp;#39;s wondering.
So I got the official answers from Apple,
and the answer is basically
almost everything happens
on device intentionally,
and those are from Apple built models,
so that should be the
fastest stuff that happens.
But in the chance that there
are things that are too complex
or just outside of the area of
expertise of Apple&amp;#39;s models,
then it can basically go one of two ways.
One is it will go to a
larger server based model
that&amp;#39;s on servers that Apple has built
with Apple silicon
using what they call
Private Cloud Compute.
So basically the info is
never stored or sent to Apple.
It&amp;#39;s still gonna have the downsides of
having to go off of the
device up to the cloud.
It might take a bit longer
if you&amp;#39;re in an area
with terrible internet.
It might not work at all,
but in the chance that this
is like a big complex thing
that could benefit from those models,
that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;ll try to do.
But the other is when you
specifically ask it for something
that ChatGPT would be good at.
And if that happens, then it
will specifically ask you,
&amp;quot;Hey, is it cool if I ask chat GPT
for an answer to this question?&amp;quot;
And then you can give it
a yes or no on the spot.
So anytime it wants to do this,
whether it&amp;#39;s to upload a photo
that you&amp;#39;re asking something about
or just do a complex prompt in general,
then this little dialogue box pops up
and you have to say yes every time,
and then you can tap into everything
that OpenAI&amp;#39;s model is capable of,
or generate even more realistic or varied,
random different styles of images
that Apple&amp;#39;s diffusion
models would never make.
This is all free without an account.
At no point is OpenAI allowed to
ever store any of these requests,
and Apple has also said that they will
obscure your IP address.
So you can&amp;#39;t even...
OpenAI can&amp;#39;t even connect
multiple requests together
to form a profile of you.
There&amp;#39;s just a lot of
thought that&amp;#39;s gone into
ideally making this as secure
and private of a version
of going to the cloud for AI
features as they possibly can.
So yeah, it&amp;#39;s really interesting,
a lot of interesting stuff going on here.
I think my overall take with
a lot of this WWDC announcements
and with the Apple Intelligence stuff,
first of all, is that the
Humane Pin and the Rabbit R1,
they were so doomed from the start.
Even if they were good up to this point,
there&amp;#39;s just no way
they could be as good as
this stuff on your phone
with all the personalization,
all the info that they
already know about you.
So I guess that&amp;#39;s confirmed,
but also it does feel like
we&amp;#39;ve entered a new age with Apple.
I think the AI stuff is so
important that it very much is
what we&amp;#39;re most interested
in and it overshadows.
Honestly, what could
possibly be your favorite
non-AI feature from
the past couple things?
Moving home screen apps
and icons everywhere,
that might be the biggest thing,
but it&amp;#39;s up to this point now all about
what this intelligence stuff
can actually do for you
and what it can bring you.
So that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m really excited about.
I&amp;#39;ll be working on some videos very soon
about a lot of this stuff.
So definitely, like I said, get subscribed
if you haven&amp;#39;t already,
but this has been your overview
or what you need to know.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you guys in the next one.
Peace.
