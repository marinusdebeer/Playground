- So there&amp;#39;s two types
of people in this world:
Either AirPods fit in your ears
or AirPods don&amp;#39;t fit in your ears.
There&amp;#39;s two types of people in this world:
You either love silicon-tipped in-earbuds
or you hate silicon-tipped in-earbuds.
There&amp;#39;s two types of people in this world:
people who really need noise cancellation
and people who don&amp;#39;t really care about it.
But Apple wants both people&amp;#39;s money.
So there&amp;#39;s two versions of
the new AirPods this year.
It was kinda confusing
the way they announced it
at the keynote, but essentially,
for 129 there&amp;#39;s the base AirPods 4,
but then for 179 there&amp;#39;s AirPods
4 with noise cancellation.
But that is not the only
difference between them.
So now that I&amp;#39;ve been
testing &amp;#39;em for a few days,
I can give you the verdict on them,
what the differences are, and
if they&amp;#39;re actually worth it.
So first of all,
let&amp;#39;s just start with
the AirPods themselves.
They&amp;#39;ve tweaked the shape
of these buds again,
and so they&amp;#39;ve gotten some new
curves and some new angles,
and the driver points a
little bit more directly
into your ear with less reflections.
The stem is also a little bit shorter,
but otherwise, I mean, yeah,
they still look like AirPods.
They&amp;#39;re very familiar.
They have IP54 dust and water resistance,
up from IPX4 last year.
And they still have the in-ear detection,
there&amp;#39;s still microphones
all the way around,
but my biggest question personally,
before anything else, was actually just,
does this slightly new shape
actually fit better in my ear?
Because I have not had any luck
with hard-tipped AirPods ever really,
since they first came out.
The latest version was the closest,
like I could put them in my ears,
but if I jogged for more
than about 10 seconds,
they would just slowly fall out.
So are the 4s actually better for me?
Slightly, but not really.
I put &amp;#39;em in my ears.
I was trying to, okay, let&amp;#39;s
see if this is actually better.
I kind of twist &amp;#39;em a
little bit, do the classic,
like, you know, get &amp;#39;em seated in my ear,
but it&amp;#39;s not for very long.
They still slowly, even when
I&amp;#39;m just sitting around,
slowly feel like they&amp;#39;re
coming outta my ear.
So I think if you had problems
with previous AirPods,
you&amp;#39;ll probably still
have problems with these,
but if they fit in your ears,
then these will also fit in your ears.
Now, all of what I&amp;#39;ve said so far is true
about both the base AirPods
and the active noise-canceling version.
They&amp;#39;re the same size,
shame shape and everything.
Like, you can&amp;#39;t tell the difference
from the outside of the buds.
Where the differences start,
though, is this new case.
So let&amp;#39;s look at the case. The
case is a little bit smaller.
It is USB type C, thank God.
But with the base version, that&amp;#39;s it.
It&amp;#39;s just a case with USB-C.
With the noise-canceling headphones,
the case also gets a small
speaker at the bottom
so they can chime when it&amp;#39;s charging
and they make a noise when they&amp;#39;re lost,
and they have wireless charging
on the back as well,
(AirPods chime)
which is super convenient.
One thing I&amp;#39;ve noticed, though,
it doesn&amp;#39;t have MagSafe anymore,
I think because this case is literally
just slightly too small now.
So the last generation of AirPods,
the case with wireless
charging would actually align
and stick to the back
of a MagSafe charger,
which is really convenient
for just like dropping it
on the charger, not thinking about it.
But this year&amp;#39;s case, you
know, slightly smaller.
I think it&amp;#39;s just a little bit smaller
than the magnetic ring.
So that&amp;#39;s gone.
So it&amp;#39;ll still charge
on any cheat charger,
but it does not stick to it
for any sort of alignment,
which is kind of a bummer.
So if you&amp;#39;ve got one of
those upright chargers,
then you try to stick it to
it, it&amp;#39;ll just slide off now.
So USB type C, upside.
MagSafe gone, downside.
I also have noticed,
and maybe it&amp;#39;s just
&amp;#39;cause they&amp;#39;re brand new,
but it feels like the magnets holding them
into the case just feels more secure.
I think that&amp;#39;s a good thing.
And this case still works with
Apple Watch puck chargers,
by the way, fun fact.
This isn&amp;#39;t a normal cheat charger at all.
It literally only charges
Apple Watches and AirPods.
But hey, they still do magnetize,
so maybe that&amp;#39;s worth something.
And then for the hidden feature
that nobody&amp;#39;s mentioned in
any of the presentations
or keynotes or anything.
Remember the back of AirPods 3,
there was a little pairing button?
So if you were manually
pairing it to a phone
or something like that,
you would hit this button.
That is gone from the new AirPods 4 case.
So where did that go?
And it turns out now it&amp;#39;s a
hidden capacitive touch area,
kind of right underneath the
pairing light on the front.
So you can double tap here,
then it starts blinking,
and that initiates the pairing mode.
And actually, a triple tap will allow you
to start a factory reset of the buds.
So no longer a physical
button, kind of a hidden trick.
The more you know.
But the biggest question
that I&amp;#39;m sure most people
are actually wondering is,
how good is the Active Noise Cancellation
on these new AirPods?
Should you actually choose to get it
without going AirPods
Pro with silicon tips?
Is it actually good?
So my point of reference is
going to be AirPods Pro 2.
You know, obviously there&amp;#39;s
lots of other earbuds
that have ANC, but just sound quality,
apples for apples wise,
that&amp;#39;s probably the
most direct comparison.
And I&amp;#39;ll say, while these are impressive,
they are definitely not
as good as the Pros.
They&amp;#39;re just not.
And this is most definitely
because of physics.
So, since the hard tip doesn&amp;#39;t
absolutely perfectly fit
inside my ear one-to-one, it
just means there&amp;#39;s a little bit
of air gaps around the
outside of it, just a little.
There&amp;#39;s a little bit of
sound that can make it
from the outside into my ear,
literally around the earbud.
So whether it&amp;#39;s white noise,
or street sounds, or voices,
the ANC clearly works,
and it does a good job
of basically lowering the background noise
so you can hear whatever
you&amp;#39;re listening to better,
but it&amp;#39;s not quite gone.
So I feel like if AirPods
Pro are like an 8 outta 10
for noise cancellation,
just based on how much
of the background noise it&amp;#39;s removing,
these hard-tipped AirPods
are around like a four,
maybe four or five.
It&amp;#39;s less noise cancellation
and more noise reduction,
if that makes sense.
Like, still very useful,
but it&amp;#39;s most useful in
particularly loud environments.
Like, if you&amp;#39;re on a train or on a plane
or with like a lot of loud voices
or street sounds around you,
that&amp;#39;s when you&amp;#39;ll most
appreciate the reduction in noise
because you can hear what
you&amp;#39;re actually trying
to listen to better.
But if you&amp;#39;re in a quiet room,
or a library, or something like that,
it doesn&amp;#39;t actually make
that much of a difference.
But then, probably just as important
as noise cancellation, is
every pair of headphones
that has that should also
have transparency mode.
And these do.
And this might be the best
transparency mode I&amp;#39;ve ever heard
on any AirPods.
Sounds supernatural probably
because literally some
of the outside environment
noise is already getting in,
and so what it boosts in
through the microphones
should sound just like it.
Some other small tidbits about these:
Battery life does technically
get slightly worse
with ANC on.
So it&amp;#39;s rated for four
hours, still respectable,
but a total of 20 hours with the case
with noise cancellation.
These also now join AirPods Pro with USB-C
as the only other headphones
to have the ultra-low latency
support for Vision Pro.
So thanks, H2 chip.
And then precision finding is useful,
but that speaker does really help
if they&amp;#39;re kind of underneath something,
or inside a bag,
or you need to find it but don&amp;#39;t
really have a visual on it.
Love having the speaker on the case.
And then if you were paying
really close attention
in the last Apple keynote,
you might have caught
that there was actually
also an AirPods Max refresh
alongside these.
But I use the word
refresh like very lightly
just because all they really
did was make it USB type C
and some new colors, and that&amp;#39;s it.
Literally, that&amp;#39;s it.
They didn&amp;#39;t do any other, no mesh updates,
no case updates, no on/off switch,
no material updates, no driver updates,
no sound quality changes, no new features,
no H2 chip, just USB-C.
That&amp;#39;s absolutely ridiculous.
And I will not be
reviewing those headphones,
but what I did see is some
comments of people asking,
like, &amp;quot;Wait, what is the
H2 chip even all about?
Like, does it matter
that the new ones didn&amp;#39;t get the H2 chip?&amp;quot;
So let me just break down what that&amp;#39;s for.
The H2 chip inside these
AirPods is basically doing all
of the processing, especially
from these microphones.
So all of the improved
background noise reduction
for phone calls, all of the
Active Noise Cancellation,
Transparency mode, and Adaptive Audio.
And it also now lets you nod
or shake your head to
answer Siri questions.
So if there&amp;#39;s like an incoming call
and it announces a new call,
you can literally nod your head
to answer it instead of talking out loud.
Or if you get a text and Siri
asks, &amp;quot;Do you wanna respond,&amp;quot;
but you don&amp;#39;t want to, you
literally just shake your head.
It actually works super well.
But then it&amp;#39;s also just
a matter of principle.
Like, there&amp;#39;s no way
your brand-new, flagship,
$550 over-ear noise-canceling headphones
shouldn&amp;#39;t have all the latest
and greatest parts
internally and externally,
but here we are.
But anyway, the sound quality
of these new AirPods is perfectly solid.
Some people were surprised at my opinion
about this last time,
but the AirPods 3 did take a
pretty respectable step up.
And while there still is no EQ anywhere
and there&amp;#39;s not a whole lot
of customization to the sound,
they do a good job of sort of
being decent at everything.
&amp;#39;Cause these have to do
phone calls and podcasts,
which have a lot of vocal frequencies,
but they also have to do movies,
and they also have to do music,
and they&amp;#39;re kind of just tuned
to be solid at everything.
So overall, 129 for the base AirPods,
179 for the AirPods with
Active Noise Cancellation.
Now you know all the differences.
Now you know what they do
and how good they are at it,
and you can choose which
one you want for yourself.
Me personally,
I&amp;#39;m still a silicon ear tips
person just for my own EarPods.
Like, they fit in my ears so much better,
the seal is so much better,
it makes the noise cancellation
dramatically better.
So I&amp;#39;m still leaning
AirPods Pro for myself.
Matter of fact, you can
get AirPods Pro on Amazon
for like 199 right now,
so it&amp;#39;s only 20 bucks more than these.
But I still think people will
happily save the 20 bucks
and get the hard-tipped ones.
They still get beat in
individual categories
by others in the wide world
of other earbuds available out there.
Like, some will have a
better fit in the ear,
which will be better for working
out and running and stuff.
Some others will have better battery life,
and even some others will
have better sound quality,
especially for music.
But these are still AirPods,
which means they work best
with the ecosystem, with
the seamless switching
between all of the Apple
devices in your life.
And they still have that sort of generic
useful frequency response
across the range for everything.
That&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re good at.
Now, if you&amp;#39;re thinking of
picking up a new pair of AirPods
but you don&amp;#39;t love the dental floss look,
well then channel sponsor
dbrand has you covered
with their new Area 51 case.
And this isn&amp;#39;t just some
regular printed design.
This topographical pattern
has a crazy like 3D-printed
texture that you can actually feel.
I honestly, I&amp;#39;m not
sure how they did this,
but the 3D ink, it&amp;#39;s super durable.
It adds this extra layer of grippiness
that&amp;#39;s hard to describe.
And this isn&amp;#39;t just some random pattern.
Apparently, dbrand put an
actual topographical map
of Area 51 on here, because
of course they would.
So there are three
different colorways of it.
There&amp;#39;s red, yellow, and black.
And I&amp;#39;m usually all in on matte black,
but this is a nice yellow,
it looks pretty sick.
And these new Area 51 skins are available
for a ton of different devices.
So I&amp;#39;ll leave a link
below in the description
if you wanna pick one up for yourself.
But that&amp;#39;s basically it.
Thanks for watching,
and I&amp;#39;ll catch you very
soon in the next one.
Peace.
