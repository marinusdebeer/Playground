- All right, so CMF Phone 1 by Nothing
is kind of a confusing name,
but what this phone&amp;#39;s trying to do,
not confusing at all.
Love it or hate it,
this is one of the most
interesting new phones in the world
at the moment.
Because Nothing came along
a few years ago and said,
&amp;quot;Hey, what if we tried to
make an average budget phone
&amp;quot;but with a focus on software and design?&amp;quot;
And it kinda worked, those
phones are pretty good.
And so now, CMF is the
budget sub-brand of Nothing,
and they&amp;#39;ve come along and said,
&amp;quot;Hey, well, what if we did
the same thing but even more?&amp;quot;
So that&amp;#39;s how you end up with this.
This is a $200 Android phone
that on paper doesn&amp;#39;t
really stand out specs-wise
in the sea of other $200
Android phones that you can get
but it absolutely does stand out
with its software and design.
And I just wanna start
with the design first
because that&amp;#39;s the most interesting thing
about this phone by a mile.
So this is the CMF phone in black.
And on the surface it&amp;#39;s
nothing too crazy, right?
It&amp;#39;s got flat sides,
pretty average bezels all the way around
this big AMOLED display,
and dual cameras up in
the corner on the back.
But then you realize two things,
first, there&amp;#39;s a knob,
like a dial down here at the
bottom corner of the phone.
And second, there&amp;#39;s also a
bunch of these metal screws
all the way around the outside.
And that&amp;#39;s because this plastic
back is completely removable
and replaceable in a
couple different colors,
there&amp;#39;s black, there&amp;#39;s also
orange, there is a blue
and there is a light blue,
which also kinda has a
little green hue to it
depending on who you ask.
So right off the bat, this
idea is pretty unique.
Like for any phone,
especially at this price,
I remember back in the Moto
Maker days a while ago,
you could sort of customize your phone
but that was also much more permanent.
And it&amp;#39;s been many years
since we had removable backs on phones.
And even though nothing else comes off
and the battery isn&amp;#39;t removable
and the back still feels
super cheap and flexible,
because it is, but once it&amp;#39;s on the phone,
it feels pretty rigid and sturdy
and it&amp;#39;s still cool to see the
ability to change the color
and it&amp;#39;s a convenient little upsell
for the company that&amp;#39;s
selling the phone itself
for so cheap.
So then in the box for the cover,
you also get this little
orange combo sim ejector tool
and flat head screwdriver
since you&amp;#39;ll need this tool
to remove the sim card tray
and all of the screws to get the back off.
And then it comes with a
matching sim card tray and dial
to pop on the back so that
everything matches up.
But you can also totally
mix and match if you want,
it kinda makes the phone maybe feel
a little bit more like your own.
So the color changing back is one thing,
but then there&amp;#39;s also this
knob I keep pointing at
down here in the corner, and
this is a separate feature.
So I remember they first
started teasing this on Twitter,
we were trying to figure out
like on the Waveform Podcast,
like what is this gonna be?
Is this a volume knob?
Is this gonna be just like a fidget toy
or is it a mapable
thing with the software?
Like what&amp;#39;s the knob?
And it turns out, it&amp;#39;s a
mounting, attaching point,
for some accessories.
So it&amp;#39;s not like something
that spins freely,
it&amp;#39;s kinda just a fancy
thumbscrew with a colorful cap.
And if you take it off, you can replace it
with one of three accessories
that they&amp;#39;ve made so far.
There is a kickstand,
which lets you prop up your
phone on like a flat table
or a surface.
There&amp;#39;s also a card holder wallet,
which lets me put up to
four cards in the back
and then slap it on the back with magnets
and carry it around with me.
And there&amp;#39;s a lanyard,
not sure how many people
are gonna put their phone on a lanyard
but you now at least have the option to,
you can securely attach it
to the corner of the phone.
So is this a gimmick?
I&amp;#39;m gonna vote no, I think
that kickstand is the one thing
that I would actually
want to have on my phone
or at least the option to have
on my phone whenever I want.
It&amp;#39;s kinda nice that that&amp;#39;s
available for it but in general,
it&amp;#39;s just the main point of it
is it&amp;#39;s one more useful thing
to separate it from
other phones at 200 bucks
in the design department.
I was gonna say, it feels kinda
like an ultra budget version
of MagSafe where instead
of having magnets,
you literally have to screw
the thing onto your phone.
But then I realized, wait,
this magnet accessory,
which is the plate
that you screw under the back
of your phone for the wallet,
connects with this
suspiciously familiar looking
ring of magnets in the middle.
So just for kicks, I slapped
a MagSafe mount on there
and it stuck like really well.
So I actually think if you
want to buy like a car mount
or some accessory to attach to this phone,
I actually think you
could buy a MagSafe one.
This is the Moment MagSafe puck
and it will hold the phone from the back,
so the more you know.
Now it obviously takes a bit of work;
several screws, the sim card ejector tool
and the twisting and all that
to take these accessories
off the back of the phone
and put a new one on,
so this isn&amp;#39;t something
you&amp;#39;d probably do every day
or multiple times per
day or anything like that
but it works.
You have the ability to.
And then when there&amp;#39;s nothing
on the back of the phone,
this dial actually kind of
protrudes the exact same amount
as the camera bump in the opposite corner,
so it prevents it from
rocking back and forth at all.
Well played, CMF, well played.
So they&amp;#39;ve got lots of neat
little hardware customizations
but the other important
thing about a phone
is what it&amp;#39;s actually like to use.
So I&amp;#39;ve been using the CMF Phone 1
for the better part of about
a week now and to be honest,
it feels just like I&amp;#39;m
using a Nothing phone,
which is a compliment.
Matter of fact, it&amp;#39;s literally
running Nothing OS 2.6
and aside from the light
up glyph interface,
it&amp;#39;s not missing a single feature
that the more premium
nothing phones actually have.
It&amp;#39;s got the cloned apps feature
where you can have more than one instance
of a single app installed.
It&amp;#39;s got Game Mode,
it&amp;#39;s got the clever little
one-handed pull down gesture
where you can pull down the
notifications without reaching.
And of course, all the aesthetics,
you know, the icon pack,
the home screen widgets,
the dots font, all that fun stuff.
You still have that
spot where you can view
all of your notification
history, underrated feature.
You know, it behaves exactly
like a Nothing phone.
And using this phone,
I can honestly say that
there were stretches of time
where I&amp;#39;d forget I was
using an ultra cheap phone.
Like it&amp;#39;s a fairly bright
responsive display,
it&amp;#39;s typically five to 700 nits,
but it&amp;#39;s an AMOLED that
peaks at 2,000 nits.
And it&amp;#39;s adaptive between 60 and 120hz
with a 240hz touch sample rate,
so it&amp;#39;s decently smooth and quick.
So just flipping around through
the daily inconsequential stuff
like scrolling through social
media or reading emails
or light web browsing,
for that stuff,
of course, this phone is
totally fine, super smooth.
The chip powering everything here
is the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 5G.
It&amp;#39;s about on par with
the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1
as far as benchmarks
and they pair it with either
six or eight gigs of RAM,
depending on what spec you get,
it&amp;#39;s really decently well
equipped for 200 bucks.
But you can definitely get this phone
to show its price though,
like it&amp;#39;s not perfect.
These aren&amp;#39;t complaints,
these are just facts about the trade-offs
you obviously have to make to
get a phone to be this cheap.
So like this phone has a 5000mAh battery
and a really solid battery life,
but there&amp;#39;s no wireless charging
and of course, there&amp;#39;s no
charger included in the box.
If you&amp;#39;re wondering though,
it supports up to 33 watts.
But then this phone also has no NFC,
it has a really crappy
cheap vibration motor.
It has a single mono speaker
down here at the bottom
that&amp;#39;s surprisingly easy to
just block with one finger.
The optical under screen
fingerprint sensor,
I actually think that&amp;#39;s pretty impressive
for this price range
but it&amp;#39;s also been noticeably
on the slower side for me
and sometimes ask for multiple
reads before unlocking.
And then these plastic backs,
you know like I said,
they feel fine when they&amp;#39;re attached
to the frame of the phone,
but like a car bumper,
when they&amp;#39;re not attached to the frame,
you can really feel how flimsy they are.
These are plastic, the
buttons in here are,
they feel like they&amp;#39;re
literally held on by elastic
that I feel like I could
snap at any moment.
I mean, they haven&amp;#39;t yet but
they just look like they could.
And of course with removable backs,
the whole phone can&amp;#39;t be
super water resistant,
so it&amp;#39;s just IP 52 rated,
basically just good for a splash.
And we all know budget phone cameras
have never been anything special,
this phone is rocking a Sony sensor.
It&amp;#39;s a 50 megapixel primary
sensor for the camera
and it takes, I would
say, serviceable photos.
They&amp;#39;re not terrible, I would say.
You know, it&amp;#39;s an IMX882, so
it&amp;#39;s actually the same sensor
that&amp;#39;s in the POCO F6
and the Realme 12 Pro
and some other pretty budget phones,
and also the Moto Edge for some reason.
But anyway,
there&amp;#39;s also no OIS so when
the light starts going away,
it gets rough pretty quick.
And then that second sensor up at the top,
well, that&amp;#39;s not a camera at all,
that actually, it almost
never really does anything.
Turns out it&amp;#39;s just a depth sensor
for specifically shooting
2X Portrait Mode photos
to get a bit of a cleaner,
more accurate bokeh cutout.
But it didn&amp;#39;t also complain
much at all when I took photos
with it covered or anytime
while shooting actually.
So, hey, budget phones make sacrifices,
that&amp;#39;s not a new concept here
but I like the set of trade-offs
that they made with this one.
I mean, squinting back at it,
it doesn&amp;#39;t look bad for a $200 phone
and I think the set of
trade-offs that they made
in the name of really
good design and software,
I like it.
Now this phone is mainly
targeted towards India,
that&amp;#39;s the market
that it&amp;#39;s supposed to
be most competitive in,
and in that market, yeah,
there&amp;#39;s other cheap phones.
They&amp;#39;re a little more expensive than this
but they will also have
like the two years of software updates
and three years of security updates.
They will also have big screens
and relatively thin bezels
and MediaTek chips.
They&amp;#39;re usually not AMOLEDs though,
so that&amp;#39;s good about this one.
And a lot of &amp;#39;em will also
have micro SD card expansion,
which this phone also has.
Probably the only notable
missing thing is NFC
but just the sheer amount of time
I was able to enjoy the using this phone
and not thinking about its price
&amp;#39;cause of how smooth it is,
all the software features it has,
that&amp;#39;s pretty sick.
It&amp;#39;s the $200 phone engineered
to look cool, basically.
And CMF has also just introduced
a bunch of other stuff as well.
There&amp;#39;s a new smart watch,
$69, nice.
Also a new set of earbuds, $59,
so to give you an idea of
what they&amp;#39;re working on.
But let me know what you think,
that&amp;#39;s my review of the CMF Phone 1.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you guys on the next one.
Peace.
