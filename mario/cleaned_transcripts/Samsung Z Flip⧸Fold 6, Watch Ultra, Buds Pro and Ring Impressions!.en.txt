- Hey! What&amp;#39;s up y&amp;#39;all?
I&amp;#39;m MKBHD here.
And today, Samsung had their expected
summer Unpacked event in July,
and they announced two new phones
and three new wearable devices.
Well, it&amp;#39;s more than that if you count,
like, the small and the large
sizes, but a lot of stuff.
I got to go hands-on with all of it,
and so here are my first impressions.
So I&amp;#39;m gonna start with
the two new phones.
This was the reveal of
the newest foldables,
so you got Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6.
And in general, these phones are very much
still minor iterations
on top of the last year.
Shocker.
I was actually thinking about that.
Like, this kind of feels like
a dismissive way of saying it.
Like, &amp;quot;Oh, Samsung settled.
&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re not really changing anything.&amp;quot;
Which is kind of true, but
also, on the other hand,
these are still phones
that are at the forefront
of two of some of the most
advanced parts of the tech world,
which is foldables and AI.
So there&amp;#39;s that.
So, yeah, the Fold 6, the big one,
looks just like the Fold 5.
You know, square up the sides a bit more,
change up the look of the camera
housing just a little bit,
and give it slightly
thinner bezels on the inside
and the outside.
And that makes the cover screen
just a tiny bit more usable.
And now both of these screens
get up to 2,600 knits now.
Give it the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.
Give it some new colors.
And that&amp;#39;s about it.
You got yourself a new generation.
I mean, there&amp;#39;s a couple
other even smaller things.
Like, you know, a slightly better hinge.
There is a new ultra-wide camera.
And the square sides, I think,
give it a little bit more interior volume,
which allows for the
60% larger vapor chamber
for better cooling.
But aside from that,
like, same battery size,
same general form factor,
same under-screen camera on the inside,
just a lot of the same stuff.
I think more of the focus for this phone
and for the others, of
course, is this new AI,
this Galaxy AI thing that
they&amp;#39;re pushing to the forefront.
And so kind of similarly to what Apple
just did a couple months ago
is they&amp;#39;re trying to
surface all of the AI things
that they&amp;#39;ve been doing and
some new stuff to the top
so you can see it all in one place
so regular people actually use it.
And they also kind of brand it Galaxy AI.
Sure.
So now, in the settings
app, right at the top,
there&amp;#39;s this new Galaxy AI section
full of all of the newest features.
Some of them genuinely useful, I&amp;#39;ll say,
others maybe not so much.
Like Call assist, okay,
clearly, that can be useful.
Like there&amp;#39;s things like the interpreter,
you can speak back and forth to people
in different languages.
That&amp;#39;s cool.
Note assist is gonna help people
summarize things inside the Notes app.
Transcript assist will
summarize voice notes.
All these things are pretty standard.
We&amp;#39;ve seen them before.
If you use Samsung&amp;#39;s browser
instead of Chrome for some reason,
you can hit that stars AI button
and get all the summarization you&amp;#39;d want
of any webpage that has
a bunch of text on it.
We&amp;#39;ve seen that before.
Generative fill of some extra information
from a photo you&amp;#39;ve taken is also not new,
but now it&amp;#39;s new to Samsung&amp;#39;s Gallery app.
So if you wanna make a photo a wider angle
than it actually was when you took it,
or maybe just straighten
the horizon or something,
and you need to fill in some corners,
it seems to do a surprisingly
good job at that.
But then there&amp;#39;s also Drawing assist,
which can take something
you draw or sketch in Notes,
even if you&amp;#39;re an absolute
piss-poor artist like myself,
and it generates art
in any number of different
styles from it in Samsung Notes.
It looks almost exactly like what Apple&amp;#39;s,
like, Image Playgrounds app is doing.
The watercolor style, a little more tame,
but then there&amp;#39;s also
this 3D cartoon style.
And if you give it some time,
honestly, pretty impressive.
I don&amp;#39;t know if this is good
art, but it&amp;#39;s just a lot.
You know, that&amp;#39;s a lot to
do with my finger painting.
So anyway, the Z Flip 6
is again along a lot of the
same lines as the Z Fold 6.
So again, Snapdragon 8 Gen 3,
squared-up sides,
slightly refreshed design.
And spec-wise, they&amp;#39;ve kind
of matched a lot of things
with the base S24.
So it actually has the
camera from the base S24:
The 50-megapixel main camera
and the 12-megapixel ultra-wide.
The battery gets bigger,
it goes from 3,700 up
to 4,000 milliamp hours,
which is promising.
And that inside screen does also get
to 2,600 knits now, as well.
And there&amp;#39;s a wider variety
of, like, widgets for the outside screen.
So, ideally, it just gets
a little bit more useful
than before.
And it also gets a vapor chamber
for the first time in a Flip
and a new base of 12 gigs of RAM.
And there&amp;#39;s these new colored metal rings
around the cameras, so you
can kind of visually tell,
&amp;quot;Oh, this is the new one.&amp;quot;
Like, I&amp;#39;m convinced that&amp;#39;s the only reason
they did these rings.
But yeah, we&amp;#39;ll have
to see if these phones
and their folding screens age better
than the previous generation.
Obviously, a slightly
better hinge can help,
but as far as I can tell,
they just look like the
same level of crease,
the same feel of a hinge,
just overall very similar
hardware package to the last year.
The cherry on top, though,
is these phones are both
100 bucks more than last year.
So the Z Flip 6 is gonna
be 1,099 instead of $1,000,
and then the Fold is gonna
be 1,899 instead of 1,799.
So it&amp;#39;s the direction they&amp;#39;re trending.
But then there&amp;#39;s also the wearable stuff
that they announced,
and I think people will
be just as interested in,
maybe even more interested
in the wearables
than the phone refresh stuff.
So there&amp;#39;s two new watches,
two new earbuds, and the ring.
So the Galaxy Watch 7 gets
a nice little refresh.
Nothing too dramatic, it
still looks super familiar,
and it stays starting at
299 for the 40-millimeter.
But then they&amp;#39;ve dropped in a big one.
There is a Galaxy Watch 7
Ultra in the lineup now.
We saw the rumors,
I talked about on the &amp;quot;Waveform&amp;quot; podcast.
This is something that we&amp;#39;ve been
kind of expecting for a bit.
And what they&amp;#39;ve finally come
up with is titanium body,
sapphire crystal display,
same size 1.5-inch circular
display as the 44-millimeter,
but a much beefier body around it
to fit in a 590-milliamp hour battery.
It&amp;#39;s water resistant to 100 meters.
They gave it a new watch face.
Dual frequency GPS, which is
also coming to the Watch 7.
And as you can see, they gave
it this big orange button
called the Action Button.
Oh, sorry, I mean the Quick Button.
It&amp;#39;s called the Quick Button.
(laughs) Which is a custom
mappable, yes, activity button
that can start any number
of different activities
or workouts or whatever you want it to do.
I mean, look, it&amp;#39;s clear
that this is targeted
at the Apple Watch Ultra.
I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re
trying to hide that at all.
It&amp;#39;s literally the same name.
But this one is also $650
instead of Apple&amp;#39;s $800.
So my question is basically
just how do they stack up head-to-head?
Battery-wise, it may actually be better.
They&amp;#39;re saying it can do 100
hours in power-saving mode.
But also, you know, feature-wise,
accuracy-wise, we&amp;#39;ll see.
Samsung is also doing this new thing
where they basically compile
all of your health metrics
from everything they measure
into one score, an Energy Score, with AI.
And I wanna give that a shot, as well.
But yeah, this is basically
just an obvious entry
to give you an option at
that higher price point,
like Apple&amp;#39;s done with their Ultra watch,
so now it&amp;#39;s gonna be out there.
Now, they also announced the
new Galaxy Buds3 and Buds2 Pro,
and they have obvious equivalents
in other ecosystems, as well.
But there&amp;#39;s some new cases
and new designs here.
Everyone&amp;#39;s saying,
actually, aesthetically,
they look like the
first-generation AirPods,
which they&amp;#39;re not wrong,
especially at the top.
But then these long stems on the Buds Pro
actually have these blade lights
to indicate different modes
or statuses, which is pretty interesting.
And then, of course, they beef up the Pros
over the regular buds,
with things like Ambient
mode and soft tips
and this new adaptive noise cancellation
that goes up or down based on
the surroundings, like sirens.
So the Buds3 are 179,
and the Buds Pro are 249.
But last but not least,
they finally gave us details
on the ring, that thing that they teased,
I don&amp;#39;t know how many months ago it was
when we first saw it.
And the idea is pretty simple.
It&amp;#39;s a ring, it&amp;#39;s a 24/7 fitness tracker,
something that you can wear
not just while you&amp;#39;re awake,
but when you sleep and when you shower
and going swimming and all that stuff.
Something you just always have on you.
Now, I&amp;#39;ve actually never
tested a smart ring before,
believe it or not.
I play a lot of sports with my hands.
I&amp;#39;ve never worn a ring for a long time.
But from what I understand, the Oura Ring
is basically the standard
that everyone is kind of familiar with,
so I&amp;#39;m assuming Samsung&amp;#39;s
gonna at least try to match
what the Oura Ring does.
So we finally get to
see this Samsung ring,
and it looks basically exactly
like any other smart ring.
Pretty minimal on the outside,
actually a slightly concave
design to avoid scratching,
which I think is pretty clever.
And then, it comes in
three different finishes
on a titanium frame.
There&amp;#39;s matte black or silver or gold.
I&amp;#39;ll give you one guess
of what my favorite is.
It&amp;#39;s seven millimeters wide
and 2.6 millimeters thick.
The sensors are all on
the inside as expected,
so heart rate, skin temperature,
accelerometer, et cetera.
And also, it&amp;#39;s water resistant
to 100 meters, as well.
So this thing is claiming a
roughly seven-day battery life,
depending on your size.
And once it&amp;#39;s dead,
you can pop it on this
clever little charging case
that, when you do, it
kind of lights up a ring
around the ring to show
you your charging status,
which is kind of cool.
And it should give you
about 1 1/2 more times
the total life of the ring until
you charge it all up again.
And then the price will be 399,
which is 100 bucks more than
the base Oura Ring price.
But the difference here
is no subscription cost.
So the Oura Ring does have a subscription,
it&amp;#39;s, like, six bucks a month,
and that eventually adds up.
But this will just be 399 for the watch.
It gets all the features,
all the Samsung Health stuff,
but you also must use
a Samsung Galaxy phone
and the Samsung Health app.
So yeah, I&amp;#39;m happy to see some competition
that isn&amp;#39;t a subscription.
And that&amp;#39;s kind of it.
That is what Samsung announced today.
It&amp;#39;s two new phones, it&amp;#39;s two new earbuds,
it&amp;#39;s two new watches, and the ring,
and that&amp;#39;s all hitting
shelves relatively soon.
All pretty premiumly priced, as well.
Wow, that was an alliteration.
That was total accident.
But yeah, all this
stuff&amp;#39;s coming out soon.
Now, before you go, what if I told you
this phone is worth $1 million?
And it&amp;#39;s not actually, but let me explain
what channel sponsor
dbrand has going on here.
So this is their latest
drop called Case Hardened.
So, if you&amp;#39;ve ever
played &amp;quot;Counter-Strike,&amp;quot;
apparently, you&amp;#39;ll already know
about the in-game economy
for Case Hardened skins.
In fact, just last month,
this AK-47 apparently sold
for over $1 million, like, actual dollars.
Apparently, this Blue Gem skin
is about a one in 21 million,
like, ultra rare.
Now, real &amp;quot;Counter-Strike&amp;quot; fans
are probably already typing comments
about how dbrand Case
Hardened isn&amp;#39;t random,
and there aren&amp;#39;t any actual Blue Gems.
But here&amp;#39;s the thing:
Just like in the game,
dbrand made thousands of
Case Hardened patterns.
And yes, some of them
are random Blue Gems.
It won&amp;#39;t be quite one in 21
million, but they look awesome.
Both designs have a sort
of a metallic sheen.
The way the light plays off them
kind of makes it fun to stare
at the back of your phone
instead of the front.
Maybe that&amp;#39;s healthy?
But I&amp;#39;ll leave a link down
below in the description
in case you wanna check it
out and spice up your device.
&amp;#39;Cause, yeah, Samsung does not exactly
go hard with the colors usually.
Yeah, either way, that&amp;#39;s been it.
Let me know what you
think of these new devices
and these new wearables
and which ones you wanna
see reviews of first.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you guys on the next one.
Peace.
