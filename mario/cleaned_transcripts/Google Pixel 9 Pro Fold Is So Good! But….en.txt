- All right, so first thing I did
when I got back from Australia was start
to catch up on the stuff that I missed.
And I put my SIM card in the Pixel Fold,
the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and
I was impressed, really.
Maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t have been so impressed
given how good the other
Pixel 9s already are.
But it&amp;#39;s a folding phone,
folding phones are hard,
but the second generation
of anything tells you a lot.
And even though this is called
the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it&amp;#39;s the second one.
The first Pixel Fold is
last year and it was solid.
It was one of my favorite
foldables to use closed
with that passport style aspect ratio,
but it had a number of
trade-offs with its price.
This one makes some big strides forward.
So let me just start with the design.
Like there was a lot of
chatter about this camera bump
on the back just &amp;#39;cause
of the way it looks,
which is, yeah, it&amp;#39;s kind of weird.
But personally this hasn&amp;#39;t bothered me.
It&amp;#39;s not like the biggest wobbler.
I wish it was wider like the other Pixels,
I wish it looked more consistent
like the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro,
but you don&amp;#39;t have to look at it much.
I&amp;#39;m guessing it looks like this just
&amp;#39;cause of the complicated
internals of a folding phone.
But then the rest of the design
around this thing is pretty nice.
It is much thinner, first of all,
and they&amp;#39;ve flattened the
sides all the way around.
So it&amp;#39;s this more modern
like squared off shape
a lot of other flagships have.
Now, the funny thing is the rounded sides
from last year were actually easier
to just pry open for a folding phone.
So you&amp;#39;ll notice that if you
use both phones back to back,
but this isn&amp;#39;t the end of the world.
And then, there&amp;#39;s a bunch
of other refinements too.
The hinge is a bit smaller.
The sides are now sort of
matte finish instead of glossy.
So now, you have matte
sides and a soft touch back.
And overall, it just feels much closer
to a normal slab when it&amp;#39;s closed.
It&amp;#39;s not fully there, like
we&amp;#39;re not quite fooling
anybody yet, but it&amp;#39;s a little
over 10 millimeters thick folded
and there are a lot of other phones
from the past year that
are around that number.
The main change though
definitely is that it&amp;#39;s not
that smaller passport size anymore.
This is a full on like
maxed out flagship size,
6.3 inch, 1080p, dynamic
120 hertz AmLED display.
It&amp;#39;s big, the last one was
more reachable, for sure.
Now it&amp;#39;s much more like
the OnePlus Open sized.
So it&amp;#39;s right around the maximum
of actually being able to use
the whole screen with one hand.
I mean your mileage may vary of course,
depending on the size of your hands.
But yeah, there&amp;#39;s also still real bezels
all the way around the screen
and it kind of pushes it
away from the hinge so
it&amp;#39;s a little off center.
But in general, I still
find it very usable
and it just feels more
like a regular phone
than ever before, which I think is a win.
I really like this cover screen.
And then when you open it
up, that&amp;#39;s when the benefits
of being taller really start to pay off
&amp;#39;cause now you go from a 7.6 inch screen
to a slightly narrower
but taller 8 inch screen
that&amp;#39;s basically now a square.
And the screen is way
better, it&amp;#39;s up to 2700 nits.
It&amp;#39;s nice and bright.
It is actually LTPO when the cover screen
is not, for some reason and the bezels
have tremendously improved
from the first folding Pixel.
So they&amp;#39;re still a little thick, sure,
but now they&amp;#39;re nicely
even all the way around
and there&amp;#39;s a whole punch
cutout in the corner now
instead of the selfie
camera on the thick bezel.
And just look how thin that is.
Like it&amp;#39;s barely thicker
than the USB C port.
This would&amp;#39;ve been a crazy sentence
just a few short years
ago, but using this phone
I wager almost everything about
the hardware of this Google phone is
at or above average, which is crazy.
It&amp;#39;s like the harder the part is to make
the better and more
above average they are.
Like this new hinge is nice and smooth
and the phone opens and closes
in a really satisfying way
and it unfolds all the way flat easily,
unlike last year&amp;#39;s phone.
The crease through the
middle is, you know,
average at worst, but
very easy to look past
when you&amp;#39;re actually looking
at content on the screen.
And they fit in a 4650
milliampere-hour battery inside,
which again is a little
above average for foldables,
even though it&amp;#39;s actually
slightly less than last year.
The speakers in this thin
body are very good and full.
The water resistance is here, it&amp;#39;s IPX8.
The flatter fingerprint reader
is easy and quick and fast.
And just this hardware feels actually
more deserving of the
word pro than ever before.
So you know, they renamed the phone,
it has pro in the name now,
but it feels like it deserves it.
But also little things
like the outer display
not being LTPO feel weird considering
that&amp;#39;s the one that does
the always on thing.
That&amp;#39;s the one you really want to be LTPO.
And it also doesn&amp;#39;t
charge particularly fast
and there&amp;#39;s no Qi2 so the phone has
this lower than normal
wireless charging coil
that can be kind of annoying to line up
and doesn&amp;#39;t work on certain chargers,
which may feel like nitpicking
but hey, when it&amp;#39;s an $1800 phone,
you are definitely allowed to nitpick.
Overall though, design wise,
I really feel like they
got a lot of stuff right.
So yeah, it reminds me of the
OnePlus Open from last year,
which won my best folding
phone of the year.
But then this one is a Pixel
and this Pixel software
experience ends up being
what differentiates it over a lot
of other folding phone options out there
because yeah, there are
totally more flashy foldables
with more advanced hardware
from Vivo and Xiaomi
and there&amp;#39;s these razor thin pieces
of hardware with head turning specs.
But if I&amp;#39;m being honest, the software
on those typically isn&amp;#39;t nearly as good.
So here you basically
have all the same features
as the rest of the Pixel 9
flagship lineup, which is great.
It&amp;#39;s call screening, it&amp;#39;s
the Pixel weather app,
it&amp;#39;s all the new stuff
basically, everything except
the thermometer app and that&amp;#39;s fine.
So Gemini is actually getting good,
like I said in the 9 review,
and I&amp;#39;m still loving circle to search,
although on this inner
screen you gotta be slightly
more careful because the slight difference
between hold to circle to search
and the tiny swipe to bring up the dock
can kind of take some getting used to.
But then there&amp;#39;s also all of
the foldable optimizations,
the two column layouts for
so many pieces of Android,
the notifications, the settings app,
so many other first party apps.
And I&amp;#39;ve just been generally loving
the larger size screen because
it feels like multitasking
and having multiple apps open at once.
Or specifically something I do a lot,
which is picture in picture with
a small YouTube video window
somewhere on the screen,
but I&amp;#39;m reading an article
or doing something else
in a full-size window, all of that
is better on this phone than last year.
And this is all Android
14, which is the same
as all the other new Pixels,
but I put Android 15 beta
on my old Pixel Fold and there are
some more folding
optimizations that&amp;#39;s just...
It&amp;#39;s hopefully, coming soon
and they promise seven years
of software updates on Pixel
9s, which is pretty elite.
So I&amp;#39;ve said a lot of nice
things about this phone,
but going into this before I
even put my SIM card in it,
&amp;#39;cause I&amp;#39;d read other people&amp;#39;s coverage
and seen stuff about this phone is I knew
that there would be
basically two main downsides
to look out for, to keep an eye on.
And those are the Tensor
chip being underpowered
and the downgraded camera system.
So, okay, it&amp;#39;s a Pixel, let&amp;#39;s
just start with the cameras.
Basically, my findings are, yes,
they are smaller sensors
than the main Pixels
and yes, they are worse,
but they&amp;#39;re not horrible.
Like they&amp;#39;re not that much worse
that it&amp;#39;s a bad camera now.
Basically, you can see the
style of the photos is the same
and it&amp;#39;s contrasty,
it&amp;#39;s high dynamic range,
but it&amp;#39;s not as sharp
is my main observation.
And this gets exaggerated
as the conditions get worse.
So in lower light the photos get softer
and lack details faster
as these smaller sensors
start to fight for light more.
So it feels on par with
like a Pixel flagship,
but from a few years
ago, like a Pixel 7 Pro.
Now that&amp;#39;s about it and that&amp;#39;s always been
one of the compromises of
these high-end folding phones
is, you know, they give you
all the software features
of the other phones, but for 17, $1800
you would also hope for
the maximum quality,
but they can&amp;#39;t fit all of
the same camera sensors
in a phone that has
all this other hardware
and a hinge and everything like that.
So if you take a lot of pictures
and you&amp;#39;re into phones
specifically for that,
that might be a tough pill to swallow.
But if you&amp;#39;re not, if you
buy it for other reasons
and you&amp;#39;re not a huge camera person,
then you may be willing to overlook that.
Me, personally, I rely too much on photos
and videos from my phone,
so that&amp;#39;s tough for me.
But the other downside
is this Tensor chip,
and this is another nuanced one.
See, Google&amp;#39;s Tensor chip has never been
best in its class power-wise
or efficiency-wise.
I&amp;#39;d argue it&amp;#39;s been good enough
for the phones it&amp;#39;s been in.
But if you wanted to
do like high-end gaming
or if you wanted a really
extended shelf life
for more than a few years
or really amazing battery life,
like Tensor is holding these phones back.
And so, people have been
trying to figure out,
all right, when is
Google going to catch up
and get on par with like the
Qualcomm level flagship chips
and the Tensor G4 in the
Pixel 9 line of phones,
including this phone, is solid
and it&amp;#39;s paired with 16
gigs of RAM in this phone,
which is awesome and obviously
helps with the AI models,
but also running the rest of the phone.
But it&amp;#39;s not amazing and
it really makes you wonder
like, okay, it&amp;#39;s promised seven
years of software updates,
but will the phone last that long?
Like these are real questions.
But word on the street is
next gen, next Tensor chip,
allegedly, maybe is gonna be the one
that finally goes from being designed
by Google and manufactured by Samsung
to the first fully custom Google chip
with three nanometers and everything.
And that could be the
huge jump that this needs.
That could be a big power jump,
a big efficiency jump,
but that&amp;#39;s just a rumor.
So I would say that if you hear that
and get excited about that
which, let&amp;#39;s be honest,
a lot of the customer base
for a $2,000 folding phone
actually does care about that stuff
then, you should probably wait.
I actually feel like you should wait.
And it&amp;#39;s weird to say
that this is both one
of the best folding phones I&amp;#39;ve ever used
and you should probably wait just
because you don&amp;#39;t wanna spend this much
and then regret your purchase next year.
But if that doesn&amp;#39;t
speak to you, honestly,
this phone as it exists
today, it feels great.
It looks great, it&amp;#39;s
smooth, the battery life,
for me, is consistently like
six hours of screen on time
with mostly small screen activities,
but then the sort of 10% of the time
that I actually open it and
do a lot more big screen use,
then you can eat into
the battery a bit more.
But I just feel like I am
productive when I have this phone.
Like it really does accomplish the goal
of feeling like I have two phones,
the regular size flagship
when it&amp;#39;s closed,
and then the mini tablet
ready to go at any time
for the multi column
layouts, the multitasking
and big productivity
apps, for all that stuff
that I really sit down and get stuff done
on my phone for, this
thing has been awesome.
Oh, and also speaking of
ready to go at any time,
I just wanted to shout out
that the new Ridge Wallet
that I designed is finally here
and it is a full grain leather
soft wallet and it&amp;#39;s sick.
RFID blocking, lightweight,
two pockets with easy access.
You can kind of just pop
&amp;#39;em up from the front
or use your finger to glide
them up from the back.
Fits up to around eight cards.
You could put cash in
it, if you want to also.
It&amp;#39;s everything you need
and nothing you don&amp;#39;t.
I&amp;#39;ll link it below if
you wanna check it out.
I&amp;#39;m really proud of it.
But yeah, look, if you&amp;#39;re
not a foldable person,
then this phone may not convince you.
Like it&amp;#39;s the same dimensions,
the same functionality, roughly.
Like it&amp;#39;s not a game
changer, by any means.
But if you are a foldable person,
this phone has been awesome to use.
Like I&amp;#39;ve really enjoyed the fact
that it really feels like a
full on flagship on the front
and feels like a mini
tablet when I want one.
Two phones in one, that&amp;#39;s the
ideal foldable phone for me.
And yeah, this is my favorite
flagship foldable ever
to come out so there you have it.
Hopefully, Android 15 soon.
Thanks for watching, catch
you in the next one, peace.
