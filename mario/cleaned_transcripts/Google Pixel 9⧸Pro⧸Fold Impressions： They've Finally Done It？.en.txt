(upbeat music)
- I think Google might have done it.
The only reason I hesitate
is because I&amp;#39;ve had
this exact same feeling
and said this same line before
about, like, the Pixel 6.
But Google&amp;#39;s phones have
always been all about software
and we just want them to get
their hardware over the hump
to have a complete competitive phone,
but I think they did it.
So Google had their Pixel 9 event today
and there&amp;#39;s actually a bit more
than just the Pixel shown off.
There&amp;#39;s also a new watch
and new Pixel Buds, and I&amp;#39;ll get to those,
but I just wanna focus this
video on the new phones
because I&amp;#39;ve been waiting
for these for a while.
So there&amp;#39;s several phones.
There&amp;#39;s the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro,
then the Pixel 9 Pro XL,
and then a Pixel 9 Pro Fold.
Now, some people are saying
the names are a bit confusing.
Honestly, it&amp;#39;s not really that bad,
except maybe the Fold.
But the base phone, the Pixel 9 is 799.
And with that you get
the 6.3-inch screen size
and it has this new design
with the flat matte metal sides
and a polished glass back in four colors,
Porcelain is white, Obsidian is black,
and then Wintergreen and Peony,
kind of Cosmo and Wanda vibes.
And then there&amp;#39;s the two Pro phones,
so the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL.
So what&amp;#39;s sick is the 9 Pro,
it&amp;#39;s the exact same size as the Pixel 9,
just like what the iPhone&amp;#39;s been doing.
And the only thing that&amp;#39;s
different about the XL
is it&amp;#39;s just bigger.
Just a bigger 6.8-inch
screen and a bigger battery.
But yeah, the Pro phones
start at 999 and 1,099,
and with that you&amp;#39;ll get
an extra third camera, telephoto camera,
they have more RAM,
and they switch to glossy rails
with a soft-touch glass back.
Again in four colors,
Obsidian, Porcelain,
Hazel, which looks nice,
and Rose Quartz, kind
of a more faded pink.
So I got to handle these
phones for like two hours,
and the entire time
right from the beginning
I was like, &amp;quot;Oh, wow, yes.
Okay, Google&amp;#39;s done it.
These phones really feel and
look like actual flagships.&amp;quot;
And it&amp;#39;s not just because
the trend these days
is to do flat sides,
like obviously I&amp;#39;ve talked
about how I like that,
but that&amp;#39;s not the only thing.
They feel a little bit
heavier in the hand now,
which gives them a more solid feel.
This screens are all much brighter.
So the Pixel 9&amp;#39;s Actua display
is 35% brighter than the Pixel 8
and there&amp;#39;s thinner
bezels all the way around.
And yes, finally it&amp;#39;s an
ultrasonic fingerprint reader
under the display, not optical.
And the camera visor around the back,
this is polarizing, but
the huge lens opening,
I think it just looks promising.
Now, of course, I&amp;#39;m gonna have to test
all these things for the full review
and really see what they&amp;#39;re made of,
so get subscribed to see that.
But my first impression at
least is that, you know,
these photos are gonna
end up very Pixel-like,
very punchy and contrasty,
and they&amp;#39;re just bigger
sensors than before,
so potentially more
shallow depth of field.
But I guess aesthetically,
the camera bump,
even though I like the older ones better,
I still kind of don&amp;#39;t mind these new ones.
I know it&amp;#39;s not the full visor
all the way around like
before and I miss that,
but it&amp;#39;s now this, like,
perfectly flat island
and that is still distinctive.
It&amp;#39;s pretty unique as
like a Pixel thing, so.
Now specs.
Let&amp;#39;s just get them all in one place.
There, that&amp;#39;s all the specs
that I&amp;#39;ve been able to confirm.
You&amp;#39;ll notice all these
phones, across the board,
all the new Pixels have
the same Tensor G4 chip.
The new chip is more
powerful, they&amp;#39;re saying,
and more efficient
and should have dramatically
better AI capabilities.
Obviously, it&amp;#39;s a Pixel,
but we&amp;#39;ll get there.
But also notice it&amp;#39;s the
exact same primary camera
and ultrawide camera
between the base phone and the Pro phone.
So, again, I&amp;#39;ve talked
about this with Pixel before
and it makes the lowest priced one
look like a great deal,
but there&amp;#39;s not a lot
of hardware difference
between the base phone and the Pro phone,
and it&amp;#39;s a $200 difference this year.
But for that in the Pro
phone, what do you get?
Maybe a slightly better
screen, a telephoto camera,
more RAM, and a better selfie camera.
That&amp;#39;s kind of it.
Now, again, I don&amp;#39;t wanna make the mistake
of judging it too soon because
I haven&amp;#39;t benchmarked it
and I don&amp;#39;t know what
long-term performance is like,
but when Google says Tensor is
20% faster with web browsing
and 17% faster with app
launching, I believe them.
I mean, these phones are
really quick and snappy,
at least from my impression.
And I just wanna say again
that I&amp;#39;m really glad they
made the smaller phone
with all of the benefits of the Pro,
because there are a lot of people
who want a better phone
but not a gigantic phone.
So having a Pro that&amp;#39;s
not a Pro Max is sick.
But of course, these
would not be Pixel phones
without a boatload of AI,
and so there are definitely
some new AI features
coming along with these Pixel 9s.
The big ones are the new Weather app,
the new Screenshots app, and Pixel Studio.
So the Google Weather app
has been redesigned for the
Pixel 9s, as you can see,
which is a bunch of tiles now,
and this very, you know,
modern-looking version of the weather.
And right at the top is
an AI-generated comment
about the weather,
maybe sometimes telling you
what to wear or something.
Cool, I guess.
I almost never use the stock
weather app on any phone
and that probably won&amp;#39;t change here,
but for those who do, all right, fine,
that&amp;#39;s a good improvement.
The new Screenshots app is interesting.
Again, I don&amp;#39;t think many
people are going to use this,
but if you do, it&amp;#39;s basically a new app
that gathers all of your screenshots
specifically in one place,
and then it scans each one of them
for any information in them
to be able to remind you later
or help you search through later.
But then there&amp;#39;s the Pixel Studio app,
which I guess that&amp;#39;s the hot
new thing in devices with AI,
is to have an app called Studio
that just lets you create
AI-generated art on device
with a simple text prompt.
Apple has just announced that in iOS 18,
but they&amp;#39;re not shipping that yet.
But the one thing I was impressed
with playing with this
one is it&amp;#39;s really quick,
like maybe three seconds or
so to generate a new image.
And it&amp;#39;s completely on device,
so it&amp;#39;ll still be this fast
when your internet connection sucks
or you&amp;#39;re offline or something like that.
So yeah, I don&amp;#39;t know,
maybe your generated pictures or memes
for text conversations or for Twitter
or something like that,
but yeah, it&amp;#39;s another
AI app on the phone.
Also, Magic Editor in photos
has this new Reimagine feature
where you can not only erase things
or reframe things in your pictures,
but you can now highlight a section
and reimagine it as something,
and it can be whatever you type,
just something completely different.
So I guess you can straight-up
make up new scenes and pictures now
that totally didn&amp;#39;t happen,
kind of like Samsung&amp;#39;s sketch to image.
What is going on?
What is a picture?
But maybe the best what is a photo feature
is this new one in the camera,
again, built right in, called Add Me,
and it&amp;#39;s actually, I
think, pretty impressive.
I got to use it once,
and you&amp;#39;re about to see
exactly me using it once.
But basically if you ever
have a group of people
and you wanna take a group shot
but you don&amp;#39;t have anyone else
who could take the group shot
for you, okay, no problem,
the Add Me feature walks you through this.
So okay, first you open the camera mode
and it tells you to kind
of wiggle the camera
around a little bit so
it can get a better sense
of 3D space and the environment.
Then the photographer, number one,
takes a picture of
everyone except for them
and leaves a little room for themselves.
Then once they take that,
they can have everybody peace out
and then one of those other people
becomes the new photographer
and tells the first person where to pose
so that they can sort of
be next to everyone else.
It overlays where the people were
and a nice white box over the scene
to help keep the framing the same.
Once the second person poses,
they snap the picture
and Google straight-up
merges the pictures together
into a group photo with everyone.
Another moment that
totally never happened.
Plus it keeps the originals too.
Very 2024.
What is a photo?
There&amp;#39;s some other things
like better Clear Calling, Call Notes,
can summarize phone calls
that you&amp;#39;re on for you,
Gemini Live, which is like
having literal conversations
with the assistant called Gemini.
It&amp;#39;s still confusing.
But generally I was most excited
about the hardware of these phones.
And then there&amp;#39;s the folding phone.
So this is the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.
I don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s called that,
I don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s not
just called the Pixel Fold 2.
Maybe it&amp;#39;s easier to remember
&amp;#39;cause now they&amp;#39;re all 9s, but whatever.
They added Pro to the name for
some reason, but it&amp;#39;s a Fold,
and the point is it&amp;#39;s
dramatically improved
from the Pixel Fold that came last year.
And it&amp;#39;s the same price, 1,799.
So, look, Google cooked with this thing.
I think the last Fold
I was constantly calling the
best foldable to use closed,
which is kind of a half
compliment, but it&amp;#39;s true.
This new one has an even bigger screen.
It&amp;#39;s 6.3 inches,
so right now it&amp;#39;s about the
size of the other base Pixel 9.
And it&amp;#39;s still reachable
because the bezels are all pretty thin.
The whole phone is thin all the way around
and it&amp;#39;s also much brighter.
It&amp;#39;s 80% brighter than the last Fold.
And then on the inside
it&amp;#39;s also a larger eight-inch
display that, like I said,
it mirrors the home screen
layout of the cover display.
And the phone with the metal rails now
and a soft-touch matte glass,
it just all feels even more premium,
like a flagship than ever before.
And look at how thin this thing is.
This has gotta be,
I mean, it&amp;#39;s definitely
one of the thinnest
foldables out now.
Maybe not the thinnest,
but each side is barely
thicker than a USB-C port,
and so combined with the flat sides,
it&amp;#39;s barely thicker than a normal phone.
Now, of course, it still has
this camera bump on the back,
which is, okay, this
one&amp;#39;s worse. (chuckles)
I don&amp;#39;t see a lot of thoughtful design
in this camera island,
but I feel like I can accept it
with the rest of this phone&amp;#39;s
design being so impressive.
It&amp;#39;s just so good.
It feels great to use
open, it&amp;#39;s awesome closed.
I feel like there&amp;#39;s just a better version
of the previous best
foldable, the OnePlus Open.
Of course, still TBD on battery life
and camera quality with these new cameras
that are different from the main Pixel 9s,
but, you know, my general first impression
is clearly pretty positive.
It also, of course, has the
Tensor G4, 16 gigs of RAM,
and all the AI benefits that
come from these new Pixels:
Pixel Studio, Screenshot app, Weather app,
all that other Pixel stuff.
It is also IPX8 rated,
so it can probably take a splash.
And Google also mentioned
that they&amp;#39;re partnering
with some number of developers
to optimize some games
for the interior screen,
so looking forward to see
what those end up being.
And it also comes in two colors:
Porcelain, white; and Obsidian, black.
So I think consider me highly interested.
You know, I&amp;#39;ve kind of been
off the foldables train
for my own daily driver for a while,
I&amp;#39;ve gone back to dailying slab phones,
but I think this Pixel
9 Pro Fold has a chance
to get me back to being a foldable user
if that outer screen
remains just as usable
as any other phone.
And the bonus is a
gigantic eight-inch screen
whenever I want it,
one of the biggest displays
literally ever in a phone.
So these phones feel, for now,
like they&amp;#39;ve actually achieved
the modernized glow-up
that we&amp;#39;ve been hoping for
from Google&amp;#39;s flagship phone.
Maybe Qi2 is the only thing missing
that I&amp;#39;m actually bummed about
that I can see on the spec sheet.
But of course, as promised,
it&amp;#39;s not just the phones.
There&amp;#39;s also a couple other gadgets.
So the new Pixel Watch 3 has
basically the same design
but now comes in two sizes.
There&amp;#39;s a new larger 45-millimeter size
that gets you, like, 40% more screen.
And the bezel is also
a little bit smaller.
So these screens are also
a lot brighter, 2,000 nits.
And there&amp;#39;s a new body score feature,
which it seems like
everyone suddenly decided
to copy from Garmin this year.
But that will sort of summarize
all of your metrics into
one score at the top.
And there&amp;#39;s also some new
running features as well.
Potentially the biggest change
is the new dual chip architecture
to give you even longer battery life,
they&amp;#39;re saying up to 36
hours in Battery Saver,
which isn&amp;#39;t exactly
pushing the industry limit,
but it should be better than last year.
And same price, 349 for the small one,
399 for the big one.
And then there&amp;#39;s the new Pixel Buds.
So the Pixel Buds Pro 2,
which at this point are
kind of like Gemini buds.
So they updated the design
to be a bit smaller,
as you can see,
just these little bud
things with no stalks.
There&amp;#39;s a little tiny stabilizer fin
to keep it in your ear, hopefully.
Sometimes it doesn&amp;#39;t work
with my ears, but I&amp;#39;ll try.
And then there&amp;#39;s a new
custom-designed A1 chip
based on Tensor
that improves active noise cancellation,
improves overall sound quality,
and also lets you have a
back-and-forth conversation
with Gemini Live.
Just a straight-up, out-loud,
back-and-forth convo with an assistant.
I will definitely be getting
my hands on these to test,
but definitely let me know
what you&amp;#39;re most interested in
for the full reviews of these things.
I&amp;#39;m planning on getting my
hands on as many as possible,
get subscribed to see this stuff.
But is it the AI features or
is it the new camera stuff?
Is it the new hardware, which
I think looks pretty sick?
Let me know in the comment section below.
Now, a few years back I
put up a poll on Twitter
asking how many of you
use a case on your phone,
and, like, three quarters
of you guys said you do.
And I guess that actually
makes a lot of sense
and phones have gotten
more expensive since then,
so I can&amp;#39;t blame you.
So if you&amp;#39;re thinking of picking one up,
I definitely recommend checking out
the Grip Case from channel sponsor dbrand.
It&amp;#39;s kind of the whole package.
It comes in matte black,
it&amp;#39;s super grippy,
it has clicky buttons,
and it adds those nice strong magnets.
And yes, obviously also super protective,
so I&amp;#39;ll leave a link down below
if you wanna check it out.
Either way, that&amp;#39;s been it.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you guys on the next one.
Peace.
