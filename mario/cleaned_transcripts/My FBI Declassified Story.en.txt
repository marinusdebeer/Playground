- So I&amp;#39;ve made a few references
over the past couple years
to that time that the
FBI visited the studio,
and I was asked not to talk about that
for what I feel like are
pretty obvious reasons.
So for years I haven&amp;#39;t,
but it turns out I am now
finally able to tell that story.
So here we are.
So for those of you who don&amp;#39;t
know, we have a studio here,
and it&amp;#39;s in a larger building
with more tenants in it obviously.
It&amp;#39;s like an office building.
It&amp;#39;s not exactly like an office building,
but you know, there&amp;#39;s a front desk,
and security and all that.
And I&amp;#39;ve been in this building long enough
that we have a pretty good
relationship with them.
So we have this one rule, basically.
So there&amp;#39;s the guy at
security at the front desk.
We&amp;#39;ll call him Bob, just for this.
But Bob and I have this one rule,
which is that if anyone ever
shows up at the front desk
and asks for me that
he doesn&amp;#39;t let them in.
I have to come out and meet them
to confirm that I was expecting them,
and then I bring them back to our studio.
So if someone just randomly shows up,
which you shouldn&amp;#39;t, but if they do,
and I don&amp;#39;t show up at
the front to meet them,
then I wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to meet them.
But if I have someone
coming and I expect them,
I meet &amp;#39;em outside.
That&amp;#39;s our one rule, and we stick to it.
So in June, 2020,
it was pretty early in this
new space that we have,
and it&amp;#39;s also right
around like peak COVID.
So I had sent everybody home,
and it was just me and
Andrew coming into the studio
to work on basically building furniture,
and making videos, and recording
the podcast every week.
So I got here pretty early on
one of those summer mornings,
and I&amp;#39;m starting to get
all my stuff settled,
and then there&amp;#39;s a knock on the door.
(door knocks)
So I open the door, and it&amp;#39;s
our front desk guy, Bob.
And Bob basically says, &amp;quot;Hey
Marques, there&amp;#39;s some people
with badges at the front desk to see you.
I, of course didn&amp;#39;t let them in,
but if you would like
to, they&amp;#39;re up there.&amp;quot;
And then he just walked away.
And my first thought is confusion.
I&amp;#39;m like, what?
What did I do on the way here
that someone with badges
would show up asking for me?
I&amp;#39;m a little concerned.
I&amp;#39;m not sure what to think.
So there was a solid
minute where I just like
stood there in the doorway,
like, okay, do I go up there,
or do I just stay here in the studio
without asking who the
people with badges are?
Eh.
And then I just went up to the front.
I went up, I went up to the front desk,
and sure enough, there&amp;#39;s three
people with badges there,
and they walk right up to me,
and they all like flash their badges.
FBI, just like the movies.
Like FBI agent this, IRS agent this.
And they&amp;#39;re like,
&amp;quot;Marques, good to see you.
We&amp;#39;ve got some questions for
you about the Escobar phone.&amp;quot;
So immediately I&amp;#39;m relieved,
but I&amp;#39;m like, oh, oh,
oh, the Escobar phone.
Oh.
Because see, a few months earlier
I had published a video
about the Escobar Fold.
If you guys haven&amp;#39;t seen that video,
basically the story goes,
there&amp;#39;s this company
parading around and selling
this $400 gold folding phone,
which they&amp;#39;re gonna use to
destroy Apple and Samsung.
And they had these insane
marketing campaigns and all this.
But really what they were doing,
as I uncovered in my video,
was covering Samsung Galaxy folds
cheaply with like gold stickers,
and then shipping them to YouTubers
and people who they believed
would talk about it positively.
And then not shipping
any of the other orders
from regular people or the audiences
that watched those videos.
Those people were getting
scammed out of their money.
And honestly, in hindsight,
I don&amp;#39;t know how they thought
they were gonna get away with this.
Like it felt pretty obvious to me.
But, you know, eventually
their whole plan backfired
when I made a video
about the entire thing.
So now fast forward a couple months,
and it actually makes sense that the FBI
and the IRS are interested.
I just didn&amp;#39;t, I didn&amp;#39;t realize
they were just gonna show
up one day, but here we are.
But, you know, shout out
to Bob at the front desk
for sticking to our rule.
Even though he probably
had a bunch of people
like Flash FBI badges at
him, he stuck to our rule,
and that was great.
So I appreciate that.
But yeah, so I came out, I
brought them back to our spot,
and they basically then
had a bunch of questions
about that video
and the process of dealing
with that company in any way.
Like any and all communications
that I had with them,
any email I&amp;#39;d ever sent or
received from them ever,
they wanted everything.
And actually it was
funny, another tidbit is,
Andrew at the time had
just started running
the business email account here.
And when they were asking like,
has anybody else on your
team possibly ever been
in email communication with this company?
And I was like, I think Andrew might&amp;#39;ve.
And Andrew just had arrived at the studio
and walked up to the
front door of our spot.
And so I like, I go, &amp;quot;Hey, hey, come in.&amp;quot;
And you know, first thing he sees is like
me in an empty studio with
a bunch of people in suits,
like waving him over.
So he has a pretty funny
alternate perspective
on this story.
So the FBI actually took
the half peeled Escobar Fold
and the scratched gold
iPhone from my videos
as evidence in the case.
They literally asked for
them and took them away.
They put &amp;#39;em in sealed plastic bags
that said evidence on them,
which is why I said at the
end of the smartphone awards
that year-
Also honorable mention
to the Escobar Fold 2,
which I also don&amp;#39;t have on this desk
because it is in the
possession of the FBI.
Someday I&amp;#39;ll be able to tell that story.
So as they&amp;#39;re leaving, you know,
they&amp;#39;ve asked me all the questions.
As the FBI and IRS people are leaving,
they&amp;#39;re like, &amp;quot;Hey, don&amp;#39;t talk about this
at all publicly, please.&amp;quot;
And I&amp;#39;m like, &amp;quot;Of course, yeah.
No, obviously you&amp;#39;re the FBI,
of course I&amp;#39;m not gonna talk about it.
I don&amp;#39;t want to interfere with
the investigation in any way.
But also like, when could I talk about it?
Like, how long do you think
before I am allowed to?&amp;quot;
And they said, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll let you know.&amp;quot;
So I&amp;#39;ve been biting my tongue for years,
not talking about it,
hinting at it a little bit,
but not anything too serious.
But since then, a lot of the
dominoes have started to fall.
You know, at first when
the scam was happening,
PayPal stopped working with them.
So they&amp;#39;d switched to
this only non-refundable
direct transfer thing with Klarna.
And then they stopped
working with them too.
And then eventually the whole
operation starts falling down,
and the guy at the head of
it named Olaf Gustafsson,
this guy finally ends up getting arrested
and going to prison in Spain for fraud,
and money laundering, and
a bunch of other things,
basically for everything
that I talked about
in those videos.
So I&amp;#39;ve been holding onto
this not really knowing like,
okay, is it cool now that he&amp;#39;s
behind bars to talk about it?
So we actually reached back
out to those same FBI agents
because they left their cards,
and they&amp;#39;re like,
&amp;quot;Oh yeah, no, it&amp;#39;s cool
now to talk about it.
You&amp;#39;re totally fine.&amp;quot;
So there unfortunately is no footage
of any of this incident,
but there is these papers
which they provided as proof
that they received property to be used
as evidence in the case.
So one Pablo Escobar
Fold 2 mobile flip phone,
AKA Samsung,
and one Pablo Escobar
Gold 11 Pro mobile phone,
AKA iPhone 11 pro.
But hey, now you basically know the story.
Yeah, pretty serious business out here,
making videos about phones
sometimes, you know?
Apparently also, if this guy
Olaf ever does get charged
in the United States,
then it&amp;#39;s very likely my
videos would show up somewhere
in those court documents, which is crazy.
And also the phones that they
took may show up as evidence.
But yeah, I do wanna get back
into a little more of the
more investigative deep
dive type of videos.
Obviously the giant scams
don&amp;#39;t happen very often,
thankfully, in the tech world,
but still they are fascinating
stories when they do.
And by the way, that&amp;#39;s not the
only encounter that we&amp;#39;ve had
with the FBI in running
this YouTube channel,
but that&amp;#39;s another story for another day.
But hey, if you want more
fun stories like this one,
let me know with the comments.
But also the latest episode,
the bonus episode of the Waveform podcast
is just stories like this one
(upbeat music)
from the past couple years at the studio,
whole story time episode.
It&amp;#39;s fun.
So go over there and
subscribe and watch that.
But yeah, that&amp;#39;s basically it.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you guys on the next one.
Peace.
(upbeat music)
It&amp;#39;s a story of how I became a villain.
For at least 24 hours, I was hated.
- A couple weeks, I would say.
- Yeah, oh really?
A couple weeks.
Well, oh, &amp;#39;cause the
video had to come out.
Hang on here for a second,
I&amp;#39;m gonna go get him.
I literally wait there
with all my bags and stuff,
and like this guy
disappears into this booth,
comes back out with another guy.
He goes, &amp;quot;Hi.
Oh, good to meet you.&amp;quot;
And he&amp;#39;s filming me now.
Okay.
- Oh no.
- So now he&amp;#39;s filming me.
A couple weeks later I log into YouTube,
and everyone on Twitter&amp;#39;s like,
&amp;quot;Why is Marques such a jerk?&amp;quot;
