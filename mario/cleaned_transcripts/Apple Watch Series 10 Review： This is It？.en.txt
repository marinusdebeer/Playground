- Okay, so there were rumors,
there were serious rumors
that the 10th generation Apple Watch
was gonna be the one that
gets this huge redesign.
Like, remember the iPhone 10,
that sort of reset the design language
of the whole iPhone line?
And 10 is just such a nice
round even number, right?
So we just kind of figured
that maybe the Apple Watch
would do the same thing.
And I even remember in my last few years
of reviewing the Apple Watch,
Series 8, Series 9,
I was like, &amp;quot;Look, these are good watches,
but clearly, very
incremental improvements.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;So if you want a big upgrade,
maybe wait till the 10th gen one.&amp;quot;
And so now here we are,
I&amp;#39;ve been using Apple Watch
Series 10 for the past week,
and it&amp;#39;s... it&amp;#39;s....
it&amp;#39;s definitely another
incremental upgrade.
Now, you know, that&amp;#39;s not
necessarily a bad thing.
Obviously, it&amp;#39;s not as
exciting as a total redesign,
but that definitely makes
this review pretty simple
as far as whether you
should get one or not.
The main physical differences
this time on the outside are,
it&amp;#39;s slightly thinner
and lighter and bigger.
So the numbers say 10% thinner
and 10% lighter for the aluminum one,
and then they actually
drop stainless steel
in favor of titanium
on the higher-end ones,
so that&amp;#39;s 20% lighter.
And the screens of both
sizes are now even bigger.
And the result is really
just that you can see more,
and it&amp;#39;s just more
comfortable on the wrist.
In fact, it actually just feels
like someone took last year&amp;#39;s Apple Watch
and just squashed it down a little bit.
And there you go, that&amp;#39;s the new design.
And of course, it&amp;#39;s more
complicated than that.
Like, there is a new metal
back that&amp;#39;s one piece now,
and there&amp;#39;s a new re-engineered
speaker that&amp;#39;s 30% smaller,
so it can fit in this,
and just other pieces like shuffled around
to fit in this new shape.
But the end result is very much
still an incremental update
instead of some dramatic new form factor.
I actually think now this
visually reminds me more than ever
of a Pixel Watch just depending
on what face you have,
just because of the way the
top edges are curved even more,
and the way everything just
kind of melts into the sides,
especially with this new Jet Black color.
It&amp;#39;s just way bigger.
In fact, it&amp;#39;s true
the larger 46-millimeter
Apple Watch Series 10
basically now runs the same screen size
as the Apple Watch Ultra.
And Apple loves to do that thing,
where they show an older
watch on the screen,
and then the newer watch with
a bigger screen next to it,
and brag about how, &amp;quot;Hey
there&amp;#39;s a bigger screen
so you can get even more text,
and even more content on the screen,
and it&amp;#39;s easier to type on
that onscreen keyboard.&amp;quot;
And to be honest, it never really made
that much of a big difference to me
other than maybe the Ultra.
But this year, I noticed
something very specific.
The Disc Sports Workout
now shows one extra line of information.
So instead of time, active calories,
total calories, and heart rate,
it now shows me time, active calories,
total calories, heart rate... and miles.
So, there&amp;#39;s that.
I think watchOS 11 literally just adds
an extra line of text in some instances
with these bigger screens,
which is kind of funny.
But speaking of watchOS 11,
that launches on these new watches
and gets pushed as a software update
to some older Apple Watches.
So you&amp;#39;re gonna get things
like the new Vitals app,
which gives you a sort of energy score,
kind of like the Garmin Body Battery.
And there&amp;#39;s a sleep apnea detection,
which just got FDA approval
to detect and notify you
of potentially high levels of sleep apnea
using only the accelerometer.
And there&amp;#39;s training load as well,
which keeps track of the
perceived intensity of workouts.
That stuff is nice,
and it&amp;#39;s also, like I said,
coming to some older
Apple Watches as well.
So if you really wanna know
what stuff is specifically
coming just to this newest watch,
so like a reason to get this one,
then there&amp;#39;s about four
that you should know about.
Okay, so let me know if these are enough
to convince you to get this newest watch.
So number one, with
this redesigned speaker,
you can now listen to media
out loud on the watch.
So meaning you could already
like take phone calls
and set alarms and stuff,
but now you can literally just play media,
like music or podcasts
or audio books out loud.
So you could be on a hike and
just forget your headphones,
and just... you could be that guy.
But don&amp;#39;t, don&amp;#39;t be that guy.
So the number two, this is
now an updated LTPO 3 display,
which means it&amp;#39;ll go all the way down
to 1 hertz instead of 10 hertz.
So now it can show the
second hand all the time
when the Always On Display is on
because it doesn&amp;#39;t take up extra battery.
Plus, it has slightly noticeably better
off-axis viewing angles,
which actually helps for a watch,
so you can sort of glance
and check the watch and still see it
without looking like
you&amp;#39;re checking your watch.
Then number three, there is a
new water temperature sensor.
So here&amp;#39;s the thing.
I don&amp;#39;t know if you can
tell by looking at me,
but I don&amp;#39;t really spend too
much time around deep water.
So I don&amp;#39;t have any test results
for this particular new sensor,
but it&amp;#39;s there now.
So.. great.
But then number four, faster charging.
So cared about this one?
Turns out, so if you use
the Puck that comes with it,
this is how you maximize
your charging speed,
you can now get it up
to somewhere around 65%
from dead in half an hour.
It&amp;#39;s supposed to be 80% actually,
but we couldn&amp;#39;t get it quite that fast.
But nevertheless, the faster
charging speed is very welcome.
And that&amp;#39;s it, that&amp;#39;s the new
big 10th generation update.
There&amp;#39;s also the new S10 SiP inside,
which doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be noticeably faster
or better at anything than in the S9.
It has an improved neural engine
but hasn&amp;#39;t been enabling
anything that the S9 can&amp;#39;t do.
So yeah, is that enough?
And the more I thought about it, honestly,
my take is that now that Apple
has called this a redesign.
Like, if you watch the keynote,
they were like, &amp;quot;This is a huge deal.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;This is a big new 10th
generation redesign.&amp;quot;
Now that they&amp;#39;ve done that,
I&amp;#39;m fairly sure that that means
that this is what the Apple
Watch is going to look like
for the next 5 to 10 more years.
Like, if this is a real
redesign for Apple,
then we&amp;#39;re gonna be back
to even smaller changes from here on.
Really, the only parts of this update
that made a big difference at all to me
are the larger display
and faster charging.
The larger display for obvious reasons.
The faster charging is nice,
especially just &amp;#39;cause
if you wanna drop it
on a charger for a few minutes
and get a bunch of use, then you can.
I would find it even better
if I was doing sleep tracking as well.
But I&amp;#39;ve mentioned this before,
I&amp;#39;m not because I&amp;#39;m using the Eight Sleep
for all my sleep tracking metrics,
and so shout out to Eight Sleep
for sponsoring this portion of the video.
The Eight Sleep has been so good to me,
which is why I&amp;#39;m mentioning
it in previous videos.
And you&amp;#39;ve already heard
about this new one,
the Pod 4 Ultra, which can get super cool
or super warm to each side
of the bed independently.
But also, yeah, it&amp;#39;s doing
that biometric tracking
with 99% accuracy no
matter how you&amp;#39;re sleeping,
which I think is actually an advantage
over something on the back of your wrist.
So then you just jump in the
app and you can see, you know,
here&amp;#39;s the different stages of sleep here.
I&amp;#39;ve been waking up in the
middle of the night randomly
since coming back from
Australia&amp;#39;s time zone,
but this is a pretty
good night right here.
You can see heart rate, heart
rate variability, breath rate.
No snoring, which is great. (chuckles)
And it&amp;#39;s helping me get back
into my sleep routine
here on the East Coast,
and it can help anyone
sleep better, honestly.
So you just add the Pod
to your current mattress
like a fitted sheet,
and it automatically cools down
or warms up each side of the bed.
So you can go to eightsleep.com/mkbhd
and get $350 off Pod 4 Ultra,
or 200 bucks off the Pod 4.
And then you can also leave
your wearable on the nightstand.
But okay, so if you have
an older Apple Watch,
Series 4, 5, 6, 7,
and you want a new one,
then okay, yeah, this
is the upgrade to get.
That&amp;#39;s like the easiest,
no-brainer conclusion
in the world for this product.
But I&amp;#39;m going the extra step as a reviewer
and predicting the future of this product,
and just based on Apple&amp;#39;s
language in their presentations,
I really don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re
getting any planned big upgrades
to this watch for a while,
which is unfortunate.
But like, all those major
features we are thinking about,
like a rotating bezel,
or a circular shape,
or a meaningful
improvement to the battery,
any of which would&amp;#39;ve
been the biggest change
to the Apple Watch in years,
we didn&amp;#39;t get any of that
with this 10th gen redesign.
So it feels like they&amp;#39;re not
planning on doing any of it.
So this is the 10th gen Apple watch,
and this feels like
Apple&amp;#39;s big statement of,
&amp;quot;This is the Apple Watch.&amp;quot; (chuckles)
It&amp;#39;s the squircle, no rotating bezel,
these are the buttons, this is the shape,
18-hour battery life, over and over again.
Take it or leave it.
That&amp;#39;s it, that&amp;#39;s the review.
Thanks for watching.
I&amp;#39;ll catch you guys in
the next one, peace.
