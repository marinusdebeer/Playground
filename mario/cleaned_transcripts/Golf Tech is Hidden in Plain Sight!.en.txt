(bouncy upbeat music)
- So every sport has some sort
of tech involved in the
show somewhere now, right?
Like tennis has the famous
replay in or out graphic.
American football has the digital line
of scrimmage we all know.
And football, football has
this sweet new offsides graphic
and golf has this,
the shot tracer.
So some of you who&amp;#39;ve been subscribed
for a long time already know this,
but many of you also don&amp;#39;t.
I am a golfer. I&amp;#39;ve been
golfing for a long time.
Longer than I&amp;#39;ve been
doing like anything else.
My first ever YouTube upload,
before any other tech videos,
was a couple of golf
videos, believe it or not.
- [Speaker] Come back,
nice ball, good drive.
- But I do still watch golf all the time.
And of course, after doing
that Formula 1 video,
my brain is in tech in sports mode
and I&amp;#39;m realizing the amount
of technology hidden in
plain sight on a golf course
that makes a broadcast possible
is actually insane.
There&amp;#39;s cameras, there&amp;#39;s
also lasers, there&amp;#39;s radar,
LiDAR, optical fiber cables,
there&amp;#39;s volunteers carrying Samsung phones
with a custom app installed on them.
There&amp;#39;s so much happening here. But why?
And when you think about it,
there&amp;#39;s really one good reason
for all this stuff going on,
which is golf is hard to watch,
for a lot of the same reasons
that Formula 1 is hard to watch.
Like this sport, it&amp;#39;s not just like,
it&amp;#39;s not one basketball court,
where all the action is
happening in the same place
at the same time.
It&amp;#39;s 18 different courts
all spread around,
hundreds of yards away from each other,
all with different action
happening on them at the same time
with a tiny little white
ball flying through the air
that&amp;#39;s impossible to see.
So when you&amp;#39;re not physically
at the golf course,
there&amp;#39;s basically three
ways to watch golf,
each requiring more
technology than the last.
There&amp;#39;s the TV broadcast,
there&amp;#39;s the website portal,
and then there&amp;#39;s the Vision Pro.
(upbeat music)
So the TV broadcast, it&amp;#39;s
the most simple, right?
But there&amp;#39;s still this flagship problem
of the golf ball being tiny
and basically invisible
as soon as it gets hit.
And so that problem was
solved with the shot tracer.
Now a lot of people don&amp;#39;t
actually know how this gets made.
Like it&amp;#39;s not a computer drawing a trace
of where it kind of sees
the golf ball going.
It&amp;#39;s not an AI prediction of anything.
It&amp;#39;s actually very precisely
measured accurately.
So if you&amp;#39;ve ever been
around a golf course
or looking at a broadcast
during a tournament,
you&amp;#39;ll notice there are a ton of these,
these little towers here.
Well, they&amp;#39;re not so little
towers sometimes too.
But these towers are strategically placed
all the way around the golf
course, behind the tee boxes,
around the fairways,
and behind the greens
so that they&amp;#39;re covering
the entire golf course.
And every single one of these
towers has three things,
a camera, a TrackMan, and
a wireless transmitter.
So this TrackMan right here,
this is the special thing.
This is the radar system used
to measure the exact
launch speed and angle
and spin rates of the golf ball
the instant it&amp;#39;s contacted by a golf club.
And then here&amp;#39;s the thing,
once that gets measured,
instantly the computers
know everything about how
that golf ball is going
to fly through the air,
as soon as it touch the ball,
how high it&amp;#39;ll go, how far
it&amp;#39;ll go, how much it&amp;#39;ll turn.
And all of that will be even
more useful in the next level.
But for this TV broadcast,
from the launch data,
they can immediately
project a shot shape line
overlaid onto the hole using
the angle from the fixed camera
that&amp;#39;s sitting right behind the tee box
and immediately get that data
back to the broadcast trucks.
Now the crazy part is,
if you look around enough,
you will see these things
all over the golf course,
they&amp;#39;re hidden in plain sight basically.
Some of them are right next
to the golfers at the tee box.
Some of &amp;#39;em are actually
strapped up to TV towers.
And it&amp;#39;s not just the tee boxes.
The TrackMan launch monitors
actually face backwards
from behind the green too,
so they can pick up launch
data from all kinds of shots,
shots from the fairway.
It&amp;#39;s super impressive.
And then all of these towers
that I got to check out,
turns out they&amp;#39;re all
completely battery powered
and can last for an entire
day of a tournament.
And then also this skirt around the bottom
is actually covered in solar panels too.
So they&amp;#39;re basically
feeding into themselves
and they never run out
of power during the day.
All of this is to just
give us the shot tracer
that makes golf on TV
dramatically easier to watch.
(upbeat music)
Now sometimes, you can&amp;#39;t
always watch golf on TV.
You know, maybe you&amp;#39;re at work
or maybe you&amp;#39;re somewhere else
where you can&amp;#39;t be in front
of a TV, but you got another tab open
just so you can keep an eye
on the PGA Tour website,
so you can see what&amp;#39;s happening.
Lucky for you, they have
built this thing out.
So the website now has
this entire real time
play-by-play portal where you
can jump around to any hole
and see exactly what&amp;#39;s
happening when it happens.
And then when the tournament is happening,
every shot is updated in real time.
But what I didn&amp;#39;t realize
until seeing it in person
is just how far they go to
deliver all of these shots
as soon as possible.
So check this out.
So there&amp;#39;s a few more pieces
of tech on the golf course
that you should know about.
First of all, there are
these on fairway cameras
covering the whole course.
And basically they&amp;#39;re like that tower
that I showed you on the tee box earlier,
but it doesn&amp;#39;t need any TrackMan on it.
It&amp;#39;s just cameras and
they&amp;#39;re pointed everywhere.
And then there are also
volunteers stationed alongside every hole
with laser range finders and tablets.
So they&amp;#39;ve got this nice
little setup to be able
to quickly tag a ball as soon as it lands
and then upload its exact location.
So here&amp;#39;s how it all works. Ready?
So a golfer&amp;#39;s up on the tee box,
they&amp;#39;re about to hit their first shot.
You&amp;#39;ve loaded up the website.
Remember how I said those radar
trackers can compute exactly
what the ball is going to do
the second the club impacts the ball?
Well, okay perfect, so
that data is shot over
to the Shotlink trailer in the parking lot
where they have the feeds
from all the cameras
all over the golf course.
And this is the crazy part.
The second the shot gets hit,
that system is already projecting
a polygon on the course
where it thinks the
ball is going to end up.
You can actually see it right
here, outlined in yellow.
Then a few seconds later,
boom, the ball lands
and rolls right into that box.
It&amp;#39;s so sick.
So then, the volunteer with the laser
and the tablet will laser the ball
and get its exact location
just to confirm that,
upload it, boom, it immediately shows up
on the Tour website.
Literally within three seconds
of the ball coming to rest,
it is updated.
It&amp;#39;s pretty impressive.
And the craziest part to me
was seeing this system at work,
like predicting where the
ball is going to land.
Again, before it even lands,
as soon as they hit the ball,
it is accounting for obviously
the launch angle, the spin,
the speed, but also things
like the wind, the temperature,
the humidity, your elevation,
and all of that stuff
to give you that polygon
for probability for where the
ball&amp;#39;s probably gonna end up.
Now, obviously it won&amp;#39;t be perfect,
especially if the ball
does something unexpected,
like hits a tree or a bird or something.
But that&amp;#39;s why you have the
volunteer down on the course
with the laser just to finalize
everything and hit submit.
And they told me it
actually calibrates itself
over time, this system.
So every 10 shots, it dials in even more,
and I actually saw that
happen in real time.
I watched more shots during
the course of the day.
Some of the earlier shots
would be just slightly off
and then some of the shots
later in the day would be fixed
and they&amp;#39;d be nearly perfect.
And then there&amp;#39;s actually one more piece
of tech out there on the golf course
that I haven&amp;#39;t even mentioned yet,
and that is following every
single group of golfers
as they&amp;#39;re playing in the tournament,
you&amp;#39;ll be able to spot one
person holding a phone.
And at this tournament, the travelers,
they were pretty easy to find
&amp;#39;cause they were all wearing pink shirts.
So what are they doing
exactly, you might be asking.
Well, I got my hands on
exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing.
Turns out, every single one
of them is holding the same phone.
It&amp;#39;s a Samsung Galaxy XCover6,
a pretty ruggedized phone,
which makes sense for outdoors.
But what they&amp;#39;re doing is
keeping official scores
for the online scorecard
and their fingerprint is in charge
of closing the betting windows
for people who are online
gambling basically in real time
on specific shots.
So they literally hold their
fingerprint down on this screen
until the moment a player
starts their backswing.
Then they release it to
close the betting window.
Here you can see them doing exactly that,
wait for the player to
hit, wait patiently,
and then there it goes.
The shot gets hit,
and then whoever&amp;#39;s betting
on that specific shot,
whether it&amp;#39;s hitting the
fairway or hitting the green
or whatever, that&amp;#39;s the
moment it&amp;#39;s locked in.
(upbeat music)
So you remember when the
Vision Pro first came out
and there were all those mock
ups of all these cool apps
and experiences that
people wanted to happen?
I talked about how the ideas
for the apps were ahead
of the apps themselves.
One of &amp;#39;em was Formula 1.
Somebody built this whole
dream F1 watching setup
with the broadcast up top
and then this little mini map
of the cars on the track down below.
It looked so sick, but it
turns out that wasn&amp;#39;t real.
It was just a mock up that
no one had actually made yet,
except for the PGA Tour, it turns out,
because the PGA Tour&amp;#39;s
Apple Vision Pro app,
it&amp;#39;s insane, it&amp;#39;s the same
idea and it actually works.
So they&amp;#39;ve got the leaderboard up top,
a broadcast feed and some
other things if you want,
but then at the bottom, in real time,
you can have a mini map
of any hole on the course
with an extremely accurate map
of the hole that&amp;#39;s stitched together from,
yes, an entire team of drones
that fly over the course
and map it out a couple of
days before the tournament.
All right, so once they&amp;#39;ve got
all the drone footage imported
and stitched it all together,
this is the result.
So this is literally on their computer,
but this is a flyover of,
this is the 10th hole,
456 yard par four,
and right away you can
see tons of details.
There&amp;#39;s all the other
houses on the property,
there&amp;#39;s all the obvious
things, like the tee boxes
and the fairway.
But you see every single tree,
there&amp;#39;s the iconic tree in
the middle of the fairway.
You keep going, you can see the cart path,
you can see where the
hole is on the green.
You can see even things like the TV tower
and you flip it around, you
can see where the stands are,
I&amp;#39;m behind a tree, you can see everything.
So this is as close of
representation of that hole
as you can possibly get for all 18 holes.
And since it&amp;#39;s so detailed,
you can look at the green
and see how tilted it is.
This is a pretty flat green,
so there&amp;#39;s not a whole lot
of elevation change, but
they&amp;#39;ve got these little,
I mean this looks like
2K, you can see the little
rolling meters for where it rolls off.
It&amp;#39;s extremely accurate. So 18 of those.
So yeah, as this tournament
is actually happening,
this is what it looks like.
It&amp;#39;s basically a combination
of all the technologies we&amp;#39;ve seen
through this whole experience,
level one, two, and now three.
You see the broadcast in all its glory,
you see the scoreboard
getting updated in real time,
and then you have this full overhead view
of any hole on the course that
you can actually look around
and watch the shot flying through the air.
And these are the actual shot shapes.
Like if a player hits a low shot,
it will be a low shot in this visual.
If they hit a draw or
a fade or a high shot,
it shows all of that too,
because the launch monitor
knows all of this stuff.
So this feels like a really futuristic way
to watch golf.
I thought it was super cool.
Now, again, similar to Formula 1,
they&amp;#39;re at a new location
every single week
for every new tournament.
So it is a massive logistical challenge
to put all of this stuff
onto the course and get it all together.
Matter of fact, just
seeing everything they have
to bring in from the dozens of trailers
to the 10 to 20 miles of fiber,
running all over the golf course,
to the drone footage,
mapping out every hole,
and of course, the grandstands
and the scoreboards
and the TrackMan towers
and the TV towers all
over the golf course.
Like they can&amp;#39;t do this for
every single tournament,
but they do try for as many
of the larger, high
profile events as possible.
So it was sick to watch
this event in person
and then go back and see how
golfers hit certain shots
and how it looks on the broadcast
and then in the Vision Pro
and just to get to see
how it&amp;#39;s represented
for people who aren&amp;#39;t there.
Because for every sport, the
broadcast is so important.
It&amp;#39;s really only 1%
or less of the people actually watching
are the ones there in person.
But basically for everyone else,
they get to know the sport
through the broadcast,
through the media,
and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s so cool about it.
And that&amp;#39;s always evolving over time.
I dunno if you remember,
maybe 30 years ago,
the NHL tried something
interesting with a glowing puck.
This was like the mid-90s.
They tried to make it easier for people
to watch the broadcast and
follow the puck around.
It was well intentioned,
but obviously pretty tough execution,
even though it&amp;#39;s still kind
of cool for 30 years ago.
Nowadays, the tech is so refined
and so precise that you can track
a tiny white ball through the air
over three football fields at a time
within a couple yards of margin of error.
And it is definitely an improvement.
All this, of course,
at the end of the day,
is to put on a great show,
make a great followable broadcast,
and for the golfers to go out and compete
and to try to win the tournament,
and at the end of the
season, to try to win this,
the FedEx Cup, the precious
end of the year prize.
And I touched it, I touched
the FedEx Cup. Pretty sick.
So yeah, shout out again to the PGA Tour
for making this video possible,
for pulling back the rope,
and letting us see the behind the scenes.
Nobody gets to see this
stuff, but now you have.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you in the next one.
Peace.
