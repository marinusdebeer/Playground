(gentle music)
- Okay, so the Tesla
Robtaxi unveiling event was
a couple days ago and it might be
the weirdest tech event I&amp;#39;ve ever been to.
You might have seen some
clips from it at this point.
I was there, I rode in
the self-driving Robotaxi.
I explored the insane looking Robovan
and I talked to the Optimus robot
and then I left feeling kind of confused.
It was a weird event.
So here are the three
main big reasons why.
So first of all, the robo
cab, this was the main thing
that we knew we were going
to see, this full unveiling
of a fully self-driving Tesla.
And we saw it and it looked like this,
very, very much like a mini Cybertruck.
Like you&amp;#39;ve got the
light bar on the front,
the light bar on the back,
the complete lack of rear visibility.
Then, of course you can
see it&amp;#39;s a two-door,
two seater passenger car.
People were wondering like what
a full self-driving
robo cab or cyber taxi,
whatever we&amp;#39;re calling it
would actually look like
whether it&amp;#39;d look dramatically different
from a normal car like a
Model 3 or even a Waymo.
And there are some things that
are significantly different
about this thing they rolled out.
I mean on the outside it&amp;#39;s light gold.
Every single one is this
like silvery gold color,
although there was never any
mention of actual materials.
Pretty small footprint,
you can see there&amp;#39;s
no exterior door handles, or
mirrors, or anything like that.
And then, since they don&amp;#39;t
need any steering wheel
or pedals, they can sort of push
the seating position way
back into this more like
loungey seating position kind
of near the middle of the car
there&amp;#39;s a center armrest and there&amp;#39;s
a massive 21 inch
touchscreen in the center.
And yes, the doors go up
as if Tesla hasn&amp;#39;t learned
from their lessons of the Model X,
they&amp;#39;re making another crazy set of doors
which, honestly, is
definitely a hit visually.
It&amp;#39;s a striking feature of
this car alongside the wheels
which, at first, just look
like these huge gold discs.
But then, when you take a closer look,
they&amp;#39;re actually just normal 21 inch
low rolling resistance continental tires.
But they&amp;#39;ve painted half
of the sidewall gold
to match the caps in the middle.
So it makes it look like a
super thin low profile tire
with a huge wheel, but
it&amp;#39;s not, it&amp;#39;s just paint.
But either way, no idea how
much of this is gonna make it
to any sort of final production.
But after waiting in line for a bit,
I got to ride in this
thing for a few minutes.
So I got in, the screen told
me to buckle my seatbelt,
and once I did, the door
automatically closed, pretty smart.
Then I just selected the destination,
which was on this screen along this route,
which I assume was pre-mapped.
And then it just started
rolling, just started going.
Now, I&amp;#39;ve been in a
self-driving Tesla before,
but this one is just a
little bit more nervy
since there&amp;#39;s people everywhere
and there&amp;#39;s no steering
wheel in front of me.
But once you get over the eeriness
of basically being trapped
in this driverless car
with no manual override,
I started looking around
and noticing a few other things.
You know, you sit pretty low to the road,
similar to a Model 3,
but with more leg room
since the seating position&amp;#39;s further back.
And then, there&amp;#39;s even
fewer physical controls
than ever before in this car.
Like I basically only found
that the window switches were
in the middle next to the cup holders.
I didn&amp;#39;t even see any door latches.
Like the doors only opened with a button
on this enormous touch screen.
So again, like a Tesla, it&amp;#39;s
gonna control everything
in the car on the screen
including just watching movies
while the car is driving because why not?
So you can watch the entire trip
that I took uncut on
the auto-focus channel
if you want, I&amp;#39;ll link that below.
But then the thing is
that&amp;#39;s kind of all we got.
Like there were shockingly
few details about
the actual car actually
explained at this event
other than basically like
the three main pillars
which are gonna be in all the
headlines which are number one
that it will be fully
unsupervised, self-driving capable.
Number two, that it&amp;#39;ll
be able to be purchased
for under $30,000, all right.
But then number three, that
it would actually also charge
by inductive wireless charging.
So it pulls up over this
wireless charging pad
on the ground and it
would charge that way.
Not something we&amp;#39;ve seen
shipping in very many cars,
especially not ones with large
batteries, but that was it.
No other numbers, no other specs.
Just look at this thing,
there&amp;#39;s just concepts of a plan.
I just had so many other
questions after seeing that.
Like what is going on here?
I did at the event walk
around after the announcement
and bump into some Tesla engineers
and people who had been
working on these things.
And so, I just ended up
kind of grilling them.
Like I asked them a
whole bunch of questions.
So I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you guys
what I learned from them
and I guess we can take their word for it.
So first of all, there
is no steering wheel
or pedals, as you can see
so my first question was,
all right, let&amp;#39;s say I
see an accident coming
or there&amp;#39;s something happening
on the road in front of me
and the car isn&amp;#39;t reacting in time,
is there a manual override?
And the answer I got
was, sure, there will be
some sort of minimal
onscreen controls available,
but the goal is that you
never have to override
which is a noble goal, for sure.
I just mean it&amp;#39;s hard to imagine.
We live in a world
where that&amp;#39;s impossible,
basically, right now but I mean,
even with the wireless charger,
picture you wanna like drive over
the top of it and line it up perfectly
because if it&amp;#39;s off a little bit,
that&amp;#39;s just a giant waste of power.
But if I can&amp;#39;t adjust it
like that would be terrible.
But speaking of wireless charging,
you might be wondering why
they would try to do this?
The main answer, again,
is because they want it
to be totally autonomous.
They want people to just
be able to own several,
like a fleet of these things
and they all just drive around
and charge themselves overnight.
And the whole cable
plugging in charging thing
requires a human so that&amp;#39;s
one less human required.
It&amp;#39;ll just line up on the notoriously
inefficient wireless charger.
But my question again was, okay,
is there at least a charge port
so if I want to supercharge
or charge quickly, I can do that?
And the answer was, no,
there is no charge port on this vehicle.
So it is not even capable of
hitting a Tesla supercharger,
or doing any sort of road trips,
or anything like that, it&amp;#39;s purely a taxi.
I&amp;#39;m told there is no
plans for a front trunk.
There&amp;#39;s just the rear trunk
that they showed in this presentation.
And there&amp;#39;s no planned range
or a stated battery size.
But what they did say
is they&amp;#39;re simply aiming
for this vehicle to be
as efficient as possible,
that&amp;#39;s their main goal,
between the aerodynamics
and the low rolling
resistance tires, they think
they can aim for about 5.5
miles per kilowatt hour.
Some of the most efficient
electric cars we see today
are getting around 3 to 4
miles per kilowatt hour.
So this would be like
an A plus efficiency,
if they achieve this and
that&amp;#39;s what will let them use
a smaller overall size battery
for the lighter weight of the vehicle.
So it&amp;#39;ll be nice, they&amp;#39;re
saying, to clear 200 miles
of total range and that would put this at
maybe a 40 kilowatt hour battery pack
instead of the typical 70 to 130.
So drive train wise, that
logic does check out.
You wanna make the cheapest,
most efficient electric car
of all time, you gotta hit those things.
But then again, you&amp;#39;re
also telling us this
while doing a car with scissor
doors and wireless charging.
So you&amp;#39;re gonna have some
challenges there, for sure.
But really I think the obvious red flag,
the biggest red flag to me
is the timeline stuff that,
I mean this is notorious Elon stuff.
He gets on stage, he
says, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re gonna have
&amp;quot;this vehicle out for
$30,000 before 2027.&amp;quot;
No they&amp;#39;re not, there&amp;#39;s just no way
that they&amp;#39;re actually
gonna be able to do that.
I mean if they do, let&amp;#39;s say they do,
I will shave my head on camera
&amp;#39;cause I&amp;#39;m not confident they won&amp;#39;t do it.
Like I wanna be optimistic,
but there&amp;#39;s just
too much stacked up against it
because in order to ship this at all
with no steering wheel and everything,
they have to get all
the regulatory approval
for the full self-driving and all that,
and get all the prices
down in spite of inflation
and ship something with scissor
doors and all this stuff
in the next two years,
there&amp;#39;s just no way.
Tesla&amp;#39;s been promising full
unsupervised self-driving
for years over and over and over again
and consistently keeps pushing it back.
But then also just
price-wise, I get the goal,
but Tesla promised a $35,000
Model 3 and years later
I think they briefly
actually shipped that car
for that price for a little
bit before discontinuing it.
Cybertruck, I don&amp;#39;t know if you remember,
do you remember the base price of
what they said the Cybertruck would cost
at the cheapest version when it came out?
$39,000 and that was about what,
like four or five years ago?
Do you know what the cheapest
Cybertruck is right now?
$95,000, so you can see where
my skepticism is coming from.
But even after all that, you know,
there&amp;#39;s kind of a
philosophical question too
which is what is the
difference between this,
this Robotaxi thing and a Model 3?
Because Tesla has been promising for years
that the car that people are driving
and buying today is gonna be capable
of full unsupervised self-driving,
like the Model 3 and the Model Y?
And it&amp;#39;s actually not clear
if there&amp;#39;s that many differences.
I mean, obviously, okay, one&amp;#39;s
gonna have a steering wheel
and four doors and four
seats and the whole thing
and maybe be a bit more expensive.
But like, yeah, if my car is gonna be able
to do all that stuff I think I want
the one that can plug into superchargers
and do all sorts of carrying things.
Maybe this will be an old fashioned way
of thinking at some time in the future,
like every car on the road is autonomous
and it&amp;#39;s like an &amp;quot;old
school&amp;quot; thing to want the one
with the steering wheel that
you can drive sometimes, maybe.
I think the main
advantage of the Robotaxi,
if it has the exact same capabilities
as a Model 3 is it&amp;#39;ll
be cheaper, and smaller
and easier to operate
in a fleet situation.
That will probably be the main difference
as far as actually buying these things
because they&amp;#39;ve been
selling people the dream
of the car that you buy and own today,
you&amp;#39;ll drive it to work and
then, when you&amp;#39;re at work,
it&amp;#39;ll go drive people around as an Uber
for 10 hours or however long and then,
you drive it home when you need it
and then, when you&amp;#39;re
sleeping it&amp;#39;ll continue
to drive and Uber people around.
And so, it has all these
amazing capabilities,
it&amp;#39;ll do all this great
stuff, but will it though?
There&amp;#39;s actually a moment I had
to re-watch the event &amp;#39;cause I was there
and people are like
yelling out the whole time
like stuff at Elon on stage.
And at this point in the
presentation he goes like,
oh yeah, Model 3 and Model Y
will also do full self-driving.
And then someone goes like,
what about the Cybertruck?
And then he says, oh yeah,
don&amp;#39;t worry, Cybertruck too.
- So and Cybertruck too, yes, of course.
Sorry, I don&amp;#39;t wanna forget, yes, yes.
All our cars, basically.
- So yeah, okay, all our vehicles great,
but then it&amp;#39;s kind of quiet,
but then someone else yells
out, &amp;quot;What about Hardware 3?&amp;quot;
Which is, basically if you don&amp;#39;t know,
a reference to older Model 3s.
And his response...
- So...
[Audience Member] Hardware
3, Hardware 3, Hardware 3.
- Let&amp;#39;s not get nuanced here.
- [Audience Member] What?
- All right, next slide.
- So yeah, let&amp;#39;s not get
too nuanced, all our cars
will have it except maybe
some of the old ones.
All our cars will be able to
self-drive though, totally.
We&amp;#39;ll cross that bridge when
we get to it, how &amp;#39;bout that?
But here&amp;#39;s a bridge that I don&amp;#39;t think
we&amp;#39;ll ever actually get to cross,
which is the second thing that was insane
that was announced at this
event, which is the Robovan.
So somewhere about halfway
through this presentation,
they roll out this one of one
super futuristic looking
massive van thing.
Kind of looked like a... It looked like
the military vehicles from
&amp;quot;I, Robot,&amp;quot; to be honest,
which that&amp;#39;s probably not a good thing.
But yeah, it rolls out and they give us,
again, very, very few details.
This is gonna be a Robovan that can hold
like up to 20-ish people and it, again,
will be fully electric
and fully autonomous
and take groups or teams of
people from point A to point B.
No manual override necessary, great.
Have you ever been to CES?
Have you ever watched videos from CES?
Every year in January
there&amp;#39;s this trade show,
it&amp;#39;s really fun, in
Vegas and if you ever go,
you&amp;#39;ll notice in the south hall there&amp;#39;s
a section with all the
cars, the mobility section.
And you&amp;#39;ll find about 50 of these,
every year there&amp;#39;s just like
a van with no steering wheel
and a bunch of seats
that all face the middle.
And it&amp;#39;s like the future
of mobility concept.
There&amp;#39;s tons of those.
None of them ever ship, of
course, because there are rules.
But I guess there&amp;#39;s
not, to me, a whole lot
that differentiates that brief concept
we saw at the Tesla event with dozens
of other vaporware versions of this
that I&amp;#39;ve seen before,
that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m saying.
I mean, the fact that
this one comes from Tesla
is the main differentiator,
this is the company
that could maybe
theoretically make it happen.
But like I said, there&amp;#39;s almost
no details about this thing.
And I have almost no faith that
that thing that they showed
with its minimal clearance,
and its glass everywhere
and just lack of numbers or anything
I don&amp;#39;t think that we&amp;#39;ll
ever actually see that thing.
I could eat my words, but
like that seems crazy.
But then last but not least,
Tesla decided to bring back...
They decided to remind
us that they&amp;#39;re also
an AI company, not just a car company
by bringing back out the
Optimus humanoid robot again.
So they had these things all
over this event this time,
dancing, doing these pre-rehearsed demos.
But also, they were just
kind of out and about.
They were serving drinks and snacks
and they were walking
around and interacting with
and entertaining people
just like hanging out
amongst everyone at this event.
Now, I already have my thoughts
that I&amp;#39;ve talked about,
you know, humanoid robots before.
I made a whole video about
it, if you wanna watch it,
I&amp;#39;ll leave a link below the Like button.
I&amp;#39;ve talked about Tesla&amp;#39;s Optimus.
But even just what we saw with that,
would&amp;#39;ve been a huge step forward
from what we&amp;#39;ve ever seen.
Like this would&amp;#39;ve been one of
the most impressive things ever.
But then, they decided to take it further.
They also decided to have
these robots talking to people
and, I mean, it was way
too fast to be an LLM.
Like just watch this clip.
- [Optimus] Would you
like a piece of chocolate?
- I will take some chocolate.
- [Optimus] Right on, what&amp;#39;s your name?
- [Vanessa] Vanessa.
- [Optimus] Vanessa?
- Yes, Vanessa.
- [Optimus] Nice, pleasure
to meet you, Vanessa.
- Nice to meet you too.
- [Optimus] I&amp;#39;m Optimus.
- [Optimus] Have a great night
- [Vanessa] Great Optimus
thank you.
- [Optimus] Bye.
- Like it&amp;#39;s just a person,
it&amp;#39;s a person talking through a speaker.
It it even like stutters
and makes occasional like human mistakes.
If you watch a bunch of
videos from the event,
a bunch of different robots
all have slightly different voices.
Yeah, it was a person, for sure.
And it&amp;#39;s weird because Tesla, at no point,
at least as of the time of recording,
has not acknowledged this at all.
They haven&amp;#39;t said that or confirmed that,
but people there at the event
have heard various things
from various engineers,
I talked to two engineers
who only would tell me,
yes, all of the LLMs
do run totally on device.
But like, yeah, no, I don&amp;#39;t think so.
So this kind of became
like the talking point
of the whole event, like now we don&amp;#39;t know
how much of this event
was real or not so real.
Like how much of what
these robots are doing
is human controlled or AI.
You know, there were all
kinds of hand waving,
and gestures and movements.
I played charades with one of them.
You know what it reminds me of?
Remember that video I did at
Disney&amp;#39;s Imagineering Labs
where they had these bipedal robots
that were controlled by
a steam deck controller?
They did all kinds of walking around
and stringing animations together
to entertain people at the parks.
There&amp;#39;s just a bunch of button presses
and controllers to make that happen.
And sure, there&amp;#39;s some
AI to blend that stuff,
but you could never deny that there&amp;#39;s,
basically, entirely human
control happening here.
And that&amp;#39;s, basically,
what I think is happening
at this Tesla event, lots of impressive
and entertaining things in the form
of a super advanced articulating robot
stringing animations together.
But it&amp;#39;s just not totally ready
to do this stuff on its own.
We&amp;#39;ve never seen anything quite like it,
even from Boston Dynamics,
but we gotta be real
about the human assisted part.
But the thing is, the dream that
they are selling people
with this specific robot
is that this thing will
live with you basically,
it will be your human
sized friend, actually.
They said that it would be your friend,
it would do chores for you,
it would live around you
and be able to do all these
sorts of tasks on its own using
the AI and the vision-based system.
I think that&amp;#39;s a really far off dream.
AI is really, really quickly improving.
But I still think that&amp;#39;s a far off dream.
So, you know, to their credit,
this event, it was insane.
Like they did a lot of things
that could have gone wrong.
And if you told me in 2024 that a company
would do a bunch of self-driving car demos
around tons of people
just loose in the road
and they would have bipedal
humanoid robots roaming
around performing tasks
and entertaining people
at the same event and that they would have
a drone show like that
is just a lot of stuff
in a row that is super high tech
that could go wrong, but somehow didn&amp;#39;t.
And it represented, I think,
a very optimistic view
of the future, even though
it&amp;#39;s very much still
like concepts, it&amp;#39;s a future that is
potentially way more efficient,
potentially way safer
and more impressive in
general technologically
than the world we live in today.
So that by itself, I think is honorable.
The things that they
were hoping to be real
would be amazing and inspirational
and honorable if they actually happened.
But since they are also
a public tech company,
they felt the need to do demos
and give all these big promises.
And that&amp;#39;s where it felt
weird because it&amp;#39;s really hard
to make promises about when
we&amp;#39;re gonna deliver this future
and for what price we&amp;#39;re
gonna deliver this future
when it just feels very unlikely.
And then doing the like, robots talking,
it&amp;#39;s just like now the
whole thing is in question.
Like how much of it is real,
how much of it is fake?
And then, now we&amp;#39;re focusing on that
instead of how cool the future
could someday actually be.
That&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m at but
hey, if there is one company
that has the best chance of
bringing this all to life,
if you made me bet money on one company
that I think has the best
odds to get there eventually,
then, yeah, it would be the one
with the massive data gathering advantage
with stuff out there in
the real world today.
It would be Tesla so I&amp;#39;ll
believe it when I see it.
Thanks for watching, catch you
guys in the next one, peace.
