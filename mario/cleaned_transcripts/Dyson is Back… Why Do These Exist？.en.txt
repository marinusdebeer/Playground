(light upbeat music)
- So you remember like a
year ago, when Dyson came out
with these things,
the Dyson Headphones Combo
Wearable Air Purifier nightmare gadget.
I tested them, I reviewed
them, I gave it a chance,
it ended up still being
the single dumbest product
I&amp;#39;ve ever reviewed.
Still is.
So imagine my surprise when
Dyson unveils a new product
a year later and it&amp;#39;s just headphones.
It&amp;#39;s just like they removed
the stupid air purifier part
and left behind the giant
metal pair of Dyson headphones
that were kind of overshadowed last time.
This is them and they are $500.
So yeah, of course I&amp;#39;m
gonna give them a shot,
because, you know, on the off chance
that someone out there was turned off
by the super spreader air filter thing,
but was still intrigued by the idea
of a pair of super high-end Dyson
active noise canceling headphones.
I&amp;#39;m dedicated to giving you a fair shake.
And the thing is, it might
not seem to make much sense
until you consider that
AirPods Max also exist.
In fact, the more you compare them,
the more it feels like
Dyson just saw AirPods Max
just getting dusty sitting in the corner,
no updates after four years,
still has a lightning port,
still super heavy, just unchanged
and still getting sales at $550,
and thought, &amp;quot;Okay, well,
surely that audience is looking
for an alternative, right?&amp;quot;
And when you put them side by side,
it becomes actually
pretty clear to me that
what Dyson seems to have done is aimed
to basically one up Apple&amp;#39;s
headphones in as many ways
as they possibly could, while still being
in the same exact category
of huge heavy noise-canceling headphones.
So like I said, these
things retail at 500 bucks,
but that is 50 bucks cheaper than Apple&amp;#39;s.
It has replaceable ear
cups for 50 bucks a piece.
Believe it or not, that
also undercuts Apple.
The rated battery life is 55 hours,
which is just dramatically better,
more than doubles,
AirPods Max is 20 hours.
Also Dyson&amp;#39;s headphones work the same
on both iPhone and Android.
And of course, these also
have a real off button.
So, yeah.
But anyway, I think I have
to start with the fact
that these headphones are somehow
heavier even than Apple&amp;#39;s.
These are the heaviest
headphones I&amp;#39;ve ever tested.
451 grams, which is not great on paper.
But the thing that they at
least do well is they kind of,
they distribute it well across your head.
Now everything on these
headphones is metal,
like not just the ear cups but
also the hinges, the top band
and then basically just this
top cushion is super soft.
The left and right ones
actually aren&amp;#39;t super soft,
even though they look the same.
And that&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;ve
put batteries in here.
So the weight now is actually
higher off of the ear cups,
which is how they managed to be,
I&amp;#39;d say, just as
comfortable as AirPods Max.
They feel different, but,
you know, not a high bar.
They&amp;#39;re still super heavy.
It&amp;#39;s just they&amp;#39;re not super
uncomfortable for sitting around
and passively listening for a while.
And honestly, there&amp;#39;s
actually a lot of interesting,
sometimes clever design
with these headphones.
The main one really being these
interchangeable back plates
and ear cushions.
I&amp;#39;ll get to how they sound, don&amp;#39;t worry.
But these ear cups are a
quarter twist and an unlock away
from being totally replaceable.
And then these back
material is, it&amp;#39;s just a cap
that is also a quarter twist away
from being totally replaceable as well.
So they can both be replaced
with different colors
and then you can mix and
match different combos
of ear cups and back plates.
Now you don&amp;#39;t actually get
like a bunch of these with the headphones.
Like I said, they&amp;#39;re 50 bucks a pair.
So basically when you go to their website,
you choose between these
four base color combos
and I&amp;#39;d say choose wisely,
because then any extras you
want, you gotta pay for.
So you might&amp;#39;ve seen what people
were doing a few years ago
with like mixing and matching
different ear cup colors with AirPods Max.
Dyson basically, I think, saw this
but took it to the next
logical level and just said,
&amp;quot;All right, we&amp;#39;ll build
it right in as a feature
and upsell you.&amp;quot;
And it&amp;#39;s fine, it works.
Is it a bit of a gimmick?
Kinda. Yeah, sure.
But you can also tell
they put in real work
with the lock-and-twist mechanisms,
so they don&amp;#39;t come off easily.
But you can also always
unlock and swap out a new cap
which have lots of different
finishes, by the way.
There&amp;#39;s the aluminum one,
which is really shiny and metallic,
but the colored ones
have like a matte finish.
They almost look like a ColorWear collab.
Another clever little design thing,
and this actually comes from
the previous Tyson headphones,
is this clever little
joystick on the back,
on the back right hand side.
This is almost all of
the physical controls
for these headphones, and it&amp;#39;s great,
because it has a bunch of functionality.
You can press in to play pause,
you can go up or down for volume,
left or right, moves you through tracks,
and it sticks out, so
it&amp;#39;s easy to find blind,
you don&amp;#39;t even have to see it.
Then the only other physical control is
double tapping the left ear cup
to turn on and off noise
cancellation or transparency mode.
Unfortunately, this control
is extremely finicky
and only works like 50% of the time,
which sounds insane, until you realize
this is not a touch surface,
it&amp;#39;s just a cap on top of the headphones.
So I imagine it&amp;#39;s some
sort of like force sensor,
so you like really have
to smack the headphones
to change it.
Yeah, that&amp;#39;s not great.
But a couple other small observations,
the chime that plays when
you first put them on
is super loud every time.
I don&amp;#39;t know why. Please turn that down.
But then these headphones also
only twist in one direction,
so that way that&amp;#39;s how
you get them to fold flat.
Although, they don&amp;#39;t
actually totally fold at all.
So to bring them with you, you
need this. This is the case.
I mean I guess you don&amp;#39;t need this case,
but this is the one it comes with.
This is it&amp;#39;s basically
two flat boards of silicon
connected by some elastic,
and you kinda just push the
headphones down right in there.
You do have to shrink
them down a little bit.
And there is one pocket near the top
for any cables you wanna take with you.
Sure, that&amp;#39;s fine.
These headphones also
have on-head detection,
so they can automatically
play when you put them on
and then automatically pause
whatever you&amp;#39;re listening to
when you take &amp;#39;em off.
Pretty standard for high-end headphones.
And they also have multi-point,
multi-device connectivity.
So I add these paired to both my iPhone
and my Pixel at the same time.
And the Dyson app is pretty solid.
It lets you change and see modes,
and it still does that real time thing
where it shows you like a
graph of the last 30 seconds
of how loud it is outside the headphones
versus how loud it is
inside the headphones.
So you can see that delta
when you have noise cancellation on.
Fine. Cool.
I guess it&amp;#39;s not the most
useful feature in the world,
but it&amp;#39;s still cool to
look at once in a while.
But then of course, how do they sound?
They&amp;#39;re headphones after all,
that&amp;#39;s what people want to know.
So as your resident non-audiophile,
but someone who has listened
to a lot of headphones,
these sound solid but not amazing.
I actually did listen
to a lot of back to back
with the AirPods Max,
&amp;#39;cause that feels like the
appropriate comparison here,
and the AirPods sound better
in basically every single genre
but by like 10 to 25%.
And you can play with
the EQ in the Dyson app,
but there&amp;#39;s only three
presets, so there&amp;#39;s neutral,
that is the flattest most
honest representation.
It is actually surprisingly neutral.
Enhanced, sounds closest to AirPods Max
and it&amp;#39;s pretty good.
That&amp;#39;s my personal favorite
for listening to music.
There&amp;#39;s nice big range, deep sub-base,
and then still has crisp
detailed mids and highs.
And then bass boost sounds horrible
but it does what it says,
if you&amp;#39;re into that.
I think the struggle
really is mostly to create
like an open like wide
feeling sound stage.
The inside of the ear cups
actually is pretty shallow.
It&amp;#39;s legit touching my
ear with the fabric.
So it&amp;#39;s just not the widest sound stage
and there isn&amp;#39;t as much
instrument separation
as I was hoping for.
But in general they sound
like any other rock solid B+
noise-canceling headphones would
for around like a $300 price point.
There are also eight
microphones all the way around
for active noise cancellation
and they are decently good
at getting rid of some white noise,
but they are not the strongest.
Like Sonys, Bose, and AirPods
all cancel way more background noise
and then the transparency mode is okay.
The real strength of these
headphones, if you must know,
is definitely the battery life.
What they&amp;#39;ve done with like
getting the battery cleverly
on the band instead of
resting on your ears
made a surprisingly big difference.
And it&amp;#39;s a lot of battery.
This battery life is amazing.
Like I&amp;#39;ve only had to charge it once
during this super heavy use
of like week a half
testing I&amp;#39;ve been doing.
Yeah, like 50+ hours with a
NC on is like world beating.
So, great battery life.
Plus, they actually have an off button,
which they can&amp;#39;t all say they do.
But at the end of the day these
are still Dyson headphones.
Like why do these exist?
That&amp;#39;s the real question
that I&amp;#39;ve been wondering
this whole time testing &amp;#39;em.
And I think the obvious
Business 101 answer is
Dyson spent real R&amp;amp;D money
making this stupid pair of headphones
that have an air filter attached to them
and figured they might as
well get their money&amp;#39;s worth
and also ship something that might have
a little bit of a larger
addressable market,
which is just headphones.
So now there&amp;#39;s headphones.
So if you aim these
squarely at AirPods Max,
which is what I did,
I feel like that&amp;#39;s the
closest thing to them,
then they don&amp;#39;t seem as ridiculous.
I mean they&amp;#39;re built just as well.
They have much more clever,
interesting customization going on.
They have decent sound.
They also have like a
solid physical controls,
and they&amp;#39;re much better with batteries.
So yeah, I guess since they&amp;#39;re
cheaper they make sense.
But however, if you compare them
to basically any other
high-end normal pair
of noise-canceling
headphones in the 350 range
from any of the other majors,
then yeah, these are
overpriced, straight up.
So that&amp;#39;s the verdict. Now you know.
At least the people from Dyson
can say they shipped something.
Thanks for watching. Get
you guys the next one.
Peace.
