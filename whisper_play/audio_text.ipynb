And was the new map very different? No. It was not very different. It was largely the same. They made the seat count perhaps a little more palatable. But essentially one of the driving problems... In fact, the new map finally got to a 54-46 split between Republican and Democratic-leaning districts like the court wanted. But just like previous Republican maps, lots of the Democratic seats, in fact nearly half of them, 19 seats, which is barely Democratic, they were toss-ups. None of the Republican seats were toss-ups. They were all solid red. So the Supreme Court ordered the Commission to go back and try it one more time. It's now the fourth time. And this time, the court suggested a complete revamp, like a total rethinking of how they were going about this. The court pointed out the one big problem with all these maps was that the Democrats and Republicans didn't draft them together as a group, like the Constitution tells them to. So the court said, try drafting a map together. From scratch. In public. Hire an independent mapmaker to help. Somebody who will answer to all the Commission members, not just the Republicans. And, incredibly, that's what happens next. At this time, I will call the court.\n"
