originally was because I met barbs at Caleb's wedding and it's anything great since then how about that enough on that let's discuss the food first let's start off with the American classic breakfast you've seen it pancakes bacon sausage eggs and don't forget those hash browns however most Americans will eat another iconic American invention cereal that's right we invented the fastest breakfast on Earth you just add milk and done otherwise we have some very iconic Regional Cuisines for one let's bring it to the Native American side such dishes that are shared amongst numerous tribes in lower 48 include things like fry bread bison jerky Three Sisters too wojapi pemmican wild rice whereas for the Inuits up north you might find whale blubber meat Caribou slash reindeer Meat and Sausage cloudberry or salmonberry jams smoked Alaskan Salmons king crab legs and a goo duck their desserts whereas on the islands like Hawaii and Samoa you'll find many dishes baked in their own versions of the Earth Oven POI or mashed purple tarot paste and Kakui nut meat is the Staple in many dishes they specialize in numerous garnished seafood dishes like ahiyahi and Pacific Lobster in the immigrants it's like the Filipinos Portuguese and Japanese even have Incorporated their own Fusion to modern day Hawaiian Cuisine things like loco moco spam Musubi and pokeballs then we get to Soul Food which you've probably heard of Fried Chicken and Waffles fried okra macaroni and cheese collard greens ham hocks and speaking of the South our best kept secret Cajun food imagine if you will a French cuisine was forced to use ingredients from the swamp and it actually worked almost every American grocery store has some kind of Cajun or Creole seasoning my favorite Chef gone mad things like gumbo jambalaya Crawfish Boil pralines Boudin Beignets alligator and andouille sausage New England has their own cuisine as well things like lobster rolls lobster bisque clam chowder and you can't forget Maryland Blue Crab and crab cakes they also have Tex-Mex Cuisine which typically has heavier ingredients and uses more flour tortillas instead of corn enchiladas fajitas quesadillas and also we have so many different Regional barbecue Styles and Barb's favorite Kansas City style ribs love it so so many places have their own style of pizzas and hot dogs the biggest competitors are Chicago deep dish and New York thin crust Americans are also known for their sweet pies most notably apple pie banana cream lemon meringue key lime pie pecan pie and speaking of pie is one of our favorites is pumpkin served on Thanksgiving and finally our most iconic national dish the burger which has so many Regional Specialties America will be nothing without the burger well that's it for me and until we meet again stay tuned and stay ready thank you Noah quick side note in regards to the food stuff yes we have a tipping culture at sit down restaurants not fast food chains typically rates are 15 to 20 and it's not that hard to calculate you just take the price that you owe move the decimal place one spot and then divide that by two and then add that half to the move decimal number that you originally priced yourself that you owe simple and yes we eat while walking like I said we value our time we want things now and see that's America every ethnic group has a story on how they got here and everyone has their own thing yet at the end of the day we're all on the same journey of figuring out how we ended up sitting in our cars eating Taco Bell in a Walmart parking lot contemplating life choices at 3am we've all been there anyway that's a Charming way to introduce my people to the world let's jump into the demographics oh I think all Americans they all want the same thing live a good life they just want different versions of that it's a constant wild Chase and the hunt for the next big thing we may all come from different backgrounds but we've got each other's backs that and we can all go to McDonald's at 5am opinionated it may be a little crazy but in a good way bald eagles flying through the air although those majority live in Canada now Americans are the only people on Earth who will wear sunglasses after the sun is set so watch it you gotta you gotta watch top gun Maverick it's all about the Mavericks bro where we love Adventure we love unpredictability As Americans because the craziest stories come out of the United States of America whether it be a woman who got bit in the Hand by a bear for punching it for the generations of families that like the same team knowing that you are a mixture of a plethora of stories histories and cultures there is someone who thinks an alligator is adorable um and makes questionable decisions during a hurricane so there's the ideal and then there's the reality here in Washington DC we don't even have full representation of Congress we don't even have Senators not all of us talk in a country accent the irony and like how did we all get here I ponder that a lot is being able to just go drive in any direction one of the most American things is going on a road trip and driving for hours without a second thought what it means to be an Alaskan is to live wild and floor just being able to sleep when it's light 24 out be awake when it's dark out gotta love that Midnight Sun I believe an American is someone who Embraces diversity and use it to pursue life liberty and happiness so for me in America there's someone who values and respects American ideals and freedoms but the land of the free the home of the brave honestly but America is nothing without New York it's all Happening Here absurdly stubborn in your beliefs the end of the day you're still gonna all be friends you're gonna go out and get drinks with each other we are the masters of making fun of each other hungry like after midnight IHOP and Denny's are always there for you for me it's the house of waffles it isn't just a waffle house it's a waffle home the batter up we get for calling football soccer this is America an American to me is someone who likes to have a good time and someone that likes free refills it's someone that likes very large portions at a restaurant you can use your EBT card at fast food places and wear sweats pretty much anywhere you are an American you can be anything and can turn any conversation into a competition there's no monolithic Viewpoint or perspective on what makes an American American really you get the whole Melting Pot that's what America is so what is an American this is a question I've pondered about for a long time when I was writing this script from a young age we are taught the value of individualism you are special you are unique there is no one like you in the world and in that regard we are also taught that it's good that we're different because then everyone has something unique and special to add if we're all the same then there wouldn't really be much to add or learn or grow from it's the diversity that empowers us we look at the world around us and see that they already know our songs and watch our TV shows and movies oftentimes they imitate things that we started and put their own spin on it we also regularly noticed that on the news people from all over the world fight to immigrate here they seek refuge and Asylum it seems like they really want to join this country badly so in a sense taking all of that into account not trying to sound boastful but because of that being an American citizen is kind of like it sometimes feels like being part of some kind of weird elite club that a bunch of people want to join or at the very least give attention to and we love attention it's practically our currency it doesn't matter if it's good or bad the moment you give us your eyes and ears we win it feeds us there's nothing we hate more than than just being part of the crowd every American wants to find something about themselves that makes them stick out this is why we obsess so much about things like labels and race it's one of the easiest ways to forge an identity we take DNA tests because at the end of the day we all know that unless we're indigenous we aren't native to this continent we all come from somewhere else and sometimes we're curious we want to know who we are doesn't everybody this may sound kind of shallow on the surface but you kind of have to understand like all the nations of the Americas we're kind of like the Lost Children of the world we never came from royalty or nobility no ancient legacies to honor so in a way we don't really have much to lose we have to build our own empires of course every American has a different story and not everyone will agree to this very sentiment but at the very base that's kind of what I guess it kind of somewhat feels like to be American yeah oh that was a speech in any case let's talk about the ethnic makeup of the USA shall we motion graphic time first of all the United States has about 340 million people and is the third most populous nation on Earth after China and India and has the highest immigration out of any country in the world and every nation on Earth has some kind of community or diaspora represented within it the first and country's largest demographic being the white non-hispanic group at about 60 percent which mostly contains Caucasian Americans typically with European Origins from there the second largest community are Hispanic and Latino Americans making up about 19 of the population keep in mind the Latino and Hispanic communities are also incredibly diverse within themselves and some may or may not also identify with either white or black communities depending on where they feel on the racial scale from there the black community makes up the third largest demographic at somewhere around 13 of the population after that Asians and Pacific Islanders make up about seven percent of the population the largest communities being Chinese Filipinos Indians Vietnamese Koreans and Japanese and the remaining one percent is mostly made up of Native American or home Hawaiian slash Alaskan natives also keep in mind some of these people listed here also register under two or more races or some other race so in that regard all these lines could be blurred and have asterisks applied to them depending on what the individual claims on their document we use the US dollar as our currency we use the types A and B plug outlets and we drive on the right side of the road and just like we explained in the UK episode the USA is one of the few countries that does not use the metric system our units of measurements are Miles feet inches Acres Fahrenheit pounds tons ounces pints quartz and our favorite unit of measurement the big fat gallon this is a gallon we actually measure our gas in these units too so yeah also keep in mind sometimes we don't even care we'll just make up our own units of measurement when we're too lazy we literally measure things like fried chicken and popcorn in buckets and ice cream in tubs now going back to the ethnic makeup thing it's important to note that most multi-generational Americans today have a degree of racial and genetic admixture most white Americans today are descendants of immigrants that arrive through Ellis Island not British Colonials coming from countries like Germany Ireland Italy and over time many of the whites kind of just mixed and created new American whites it's not uncommon for them to have some Native American blood as well and then it gets a little weird because some people are like oh yeah my great grandma was 184th Cherokee new I'm special and the same even applies to our black population according to a study published in the American Journal of human genetics the average black person in the USA has about 24 European ancestry but it varies by the individual we'll talk more about the racial story of the USA in a bit but first language technically the US has never declared an official language however the de facto national language and language of use for all Administration and documents is English or at least American English 28 states have voted to make English the official state language of their state three states have de facto bilingual policies they are Maine and Louisiana for French and New Mexico for Spanish and oh my goodness Cajun French sounds so cool it's like lazy swamp French as for Hawaiian and well actually I figured maybe we should let a real Hawaiian explain take it away Mr kamaka did you know that Hawaii is the only official state where English and Hawaiian serves as co-equal languages in the administration sometimes you can even hear Hawaiian being spoken in legislature meetings since the 80s there's been a.
