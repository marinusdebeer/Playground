hmm [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] home it's time to learn geography hey everybody I'm your host barbs by the way you can get geography now merged like this geography now shirt at geography now.com not selling out if it's your brand so we did the UAE the UK and now the last of the United triplet countries after doing this channel for nearly a decade of my life it's finally time we have made it to my home country let's make this a big one here we go welcome to the United States of America [Music] the USA is a very complex place when it comes to the way that it's structured and the way that the domain administers itself it's almost like 50 many countries and five territories with their own unique identities yet they all speak the same language and have some common understanding of American life everything is bigger wider spread out we love shopping and having everything conveniently available now and that's why we invented things like fast food the parking lot the modern shopping mall Highway service plazas drive-throughs the barcode pricing system credit cards escalators and public restrooms are are everywhere and they're free in any case apart from that little civil structure overview let's look at the map and discuss the actual location and sovereignty of the USA shall we first of all the USA is located on the North American continent with the main chunk of the country known as the lower 48 where 98 of the population lives is sandwiched between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to the east and west and Canada and Mexico border them on the North and South the country consists of 50 states divided into 3143 counties or County equivalents 3243 if you include territory divisions three states have weird detached exclaims on the Canadian border they are the Northwest angle and Elm Point for Minnesota Point Roberts Washington and Albert Vermont the only state distinctly divided into two continental land-based units is Michigan with the upper and lower peninsulas the capital of the country is Washington DC which is a federal district not belonging to any state and is under Direct Control of Congress despite having a higher population than some states in addition the USA has five major unincorporated territories they are Puerto Rico the U.S Virgin Islands American Samoa Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in addition there are nine minor outlying islands all of which are also unincorporated except for Palmyra atoll for some reason even though all these islands have no permanent population the US has a disputed claim over two small sandbank islands in the Caribbean as well both administered by Colombia they are the Serenia bank and the bajo Nuevo Bank as well that being said this means if you include all the territories and dependency the USA has a total of 11 time zones although only nine of them are used by people two strange time zone anomalies exist the first one being the little and big diomede Islands between Alaska and Russia and American Samoa and Samoa the diomedes are less than three miles away and are visible to each other yet they straddle the International Date Line and are hence an entire day apart from each other in addition there are 325 Native American reservations spread throughout the lower 48. these areas although under U.S federal territory have a degree of autonomy for the native tribes that administer them the largest cities in the USA population wise are New York Los Angeles and Chicago the busiest airports however are Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson Dallas Fort Worth and Denver International the US has an incredibly wide network of roads and highways connecting all states except Hawaii obviously the longest one being U.S Route 20 although the US does have a relatively wide rail network for freight trains passenger train lines have decreased over the years in favor of Road Transport and today the only long-distance inner city network is operated by Amtrak our largest shipping Port is the Port of Los Angeles in conjunction with the Port of Long Beach which are two separate entities yet physically joined finally one last thing although the USA has no claim over Antarctica we do have the largest Antarctic station at mcmurdle which can facilitate up to a thousand people and we also have the only station located on the geographic South Pole at Edmondson Scott station in case if you were wondering it follows the plus 12 UTC time zone fun fact did you know that in Hawaii it's actually illegal to laugh loudly so you kind of have to keep it at a low ha few side notes one I made a video explaining the Native American reservations and statistical areas as well as territories of the USA I figured they deserve their own videos because it's a big topic check them out two each state and territory has their own flag license plate design and nickname for example the state I was born in Minnesota is the land of ten thousand lakes Indiana I still have no idea what a Hoosier is but you do you cities have nicknames too like Chicago is shy town or the windy city New York the Big Apple Orlando the Big Orange Seattle is the Emerald City and so on three yes the USA is a Car Country it's part of our culture see the majority of our country was built post-industrial Revolution so many of our cities have easily navigable straight grid like Road networks with accommodating wider roads as opposed to the spiderweb of narrow medieval Cobblestone alleys built for pedestrians in the U.S you can get your own license at age 16 for many of us it's a rite of passage and bragging right in high school to show off your car even if you're just borrowing mom's minivan four we also kind of have an awkward situation with Guantanamo Bay which is located in Cuba it's kind of like this I am the first president of Cuba now that we are independent from the US I will offer you a Perpetual lease to Guantanamo Bay awesome we'll pay you guys every year we are the new Cuba we don't want you get out hey your old president agreed a Perpetual lease to us until both countries agree or we abandoned the property we don't want to do that we're going to stay here well uh yeah Revolution we don't recognize that treaty well we do here's your lease check for the year thanks for doing business I'll shake myself we'll see you next year okay okay oh yeah that's the other thing at one point the USA took administrative control over Cuba after the Spanish-American war in addition to Guam Puerto Rico and the Philippines of course the Philippines and Cuba gained their own independence and the US also used to control the Panama Canal Zone for about 70 years it was like all right Panama you're getting your independence from us whoa me gusta but I agreed to let the Americans have sovereignty over the Canal Zone because you know they're they're kind of building it what the I mean uh you want us to leave and take all of our money and you finish building it or ah for now no let's talk in 70 years okay then yeah in addition after World War II we took administrative control over many of the islands in the Pacific that Japan used to control the three micronesian Island groups of allow the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia were labeled as U.S trust territories until they gained independence in 1986. today they are the only countries that have the compact of free association status meaning the U.S provides defense financial assistance and Social Services to the countries whereas the citizens are allowed to move live and work in the U.S and easily obtain citizenship if they desire and in return they allow the us to have military bases in any case every section of the United States has a unique story on how it eventually became part of the country it basically goes like this for example the USA started as 13 British colonies that pretty much operated everything east of the Mississippi River at one point everything up to what is now Minnesota was just called Virginia in 1803 we obtained the Louisiana Purchase from France which didn't even have a properly defined western border it just kind of arbitrarily ended at the Rockies this doubled the size of the country and a bunch of Acadian french-speaking criminals from Canada suddenly became American in 1819 we expanded to the Pacific for the first time and had a shared condominium with the British in Oregon Territory two years later Florida was seated to us from Spain in a treaty in which we said that we would cede any claims to Texas while long story incredibly short the Texans and Texas kind of fought Mexico and became their own country for 10 years and then decided to see their country back to the USA in 1848 the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War and the Alta California area was seated to the USA and after some quick borderline readjustments and new States popping up the continuous USA was complete the guano Islands act started in the 1850s got us to claim a bunch of random small islands in the Pacific and the Caribbean Civil War split us up for about 10 years but then we reunited meanwhile Alaska was purchased by Russia 1898 Hawaii was annexed from the Kingdom of Hawaii one year later after the Spanish-American War a bunch of new islands joined but only Puerto Rico and Guam would stay as territories one year later Samoa was taken over under the tripartite convention later only what is now American Samoa would vote to remain and finally in 1917 we bought the Virgin Islands from Denmark yeah almost every American has played the Oregon Trail in school and has died of Disney Terry just want to give a huge thanks to brighttrip for making that animation you guys are awesome check out their websites they got some cool stuff hey we tried to buy Greenland like three times and they kept saying no but like come on Greenland come on on that note you can kind of tell the story behind places in the USA based off the language the name comes from for example many places in the middle of the USA that used to be part of the Louisiana Purchase have French names like Lafayette Des Moines hell the entirety of Louisiana was named after King Louis the 16th 14th whatever we're not French anymore places that used to belong to Spain and later Mexico have Spanish names like Puerto Rico San Diego and yes even the city I live in Los Angeles Los Angeles otherwise many cities and half of all the states are named after Native American words and or anglicized versions of Native American words Kentucky Ohio Oklahoma the city of Chicago means Wild Onion in the Miami Illinois tribe language in any case basically our country was born out of Revolution long story short we were a colony of Great Britain not the UK yet but Great Britain for about 1 170 years until King George III came in and went back crazy or at least that's how we see it you know the Brits are more like you ungrateful Colonials we declared independence in 1776 which by the way thank you Morocco for being the first country in the world to recognize this as a nation in 1777. hey I beat them to it in 1776. hey you don't get to speak for me as a nation as a whole you will recognize them when I say so okay now you can recognize them however the fighting went on for seven more years until the Treaty of Paris was signed in which Britain officially recognized us as a nation meanwhile Canada just up north was like now I'm daddy's favorite but then like 80 years later it was like oh I'm still dad's favorite in any case with the exception of a few other political entities up until then most of the world have been ruled either by monarchs or some kind of singular figurehead with huge Authority that all Administration pointed towards the U.S founding fathers developed a system of mixing elements of English common law Enlightenment philosophy classic republicanism from ancient Greece and Rome federalism and separation of of power basically because we were so traumatized by the monarchial rule we wanted to make a country ruled by a system that would make it really hard for the government to have too much power in addition we decided to become a federation as in states share a singular sovereignty and must abide by the same Federal Constitution and the rights that it gives like freedom of speech and press but aside from that they have the right to operate autonomously based on whatever Regional values that each state holds and votes on this is why sometimes people have to cross state lines to do things that might otherwise be illegal in the states they live in important to know not everything was perfect in the beginning legislatively of course we still had a long way to go and many things to fix for example slavery was still practice and it did have legal Provisions women were not able to vote and so on but for.
