Please provide a detailed summary of the following: 
private room in their closet uh with a shrine dedicated to Selena with all that being said so many of our American artists have gained International recognition and fan base you can be in the middle of the Himalayas going Camelback and come upon a salt mine and some dude is gonna be all like dude have you ever checked out the Thriller record for Michael Jackson and then he's gonna you're gonna be like yeah who doesn't know Michael Jackson yeah bro oh there's a thriller I'm sure this part is gonna get flagged and taken down anyways I love all of you thanks so much for uh having me on the America episode my name's Keith good job Keith yes America thank you Keith the real original Florida man okay so yeah I'm not even gonna try and end this segment with something witty this episode is already the longest we've ever had on the channel so let's just jump into the final segment shall we the friend zone when it comes to our diplomacy and foreign policy the USA is quite the extrovert and even if there's a diplomatic strain or limited interaction in one area of the world we still have some degree of connection thanks to our incredibly diverse population in diaspora communities I literally found people from places like South Sudan the Solomon Islands and even our rarest guests carry from tuvalu here in the United States that's how insanely diverse and interconnected our nation is in any case the motion graphic as a member of numerous igos in Asia the USA Works closely with many members and has deep ties to them for example after World War II and the Korean War the US has invested heavily in Japan and South Korea and today they are the only two East Asian countries with visa-free access to the U.S the Philippines is super close to as they were once a U.S Colony they speak English and many American cultural traits have adopted into Filipino Society India shares a close relationship as they make the second largest Asian diaspora community in the U.S after the Chinese they have huge bilateral trade deals and joint military exercises they are easy to engage with as an anglophone nation and heads of state have met numerous times with China it's almost always a complicated extensive economic based relationship and of course there's the whole Taiwan thing basically in the 70s former president Richard Nixon visited and soon after the U.S China joint communique and the six assurances were established long story short no matter how things get we keep doing this thing where it's like I think I'm better than you but I want to keep dancing with you otherwise as a member of various North and South American organizations the US has very obvious and close ties to their North and South American Neighbors in the broadest sense they are all kind of like new world countries that share a similar story of being built off of European colonialism evolving into the vibrant new societies that they are today the US was the first country to recognize Brazil as a nation in 1808 and many sociologists will say that Brazil is kind of like the closest country resembling the US in shared experiences related to their demographic makeup the only real major difference is that Brazil was more Catholic influence whereas the US was more Protestant otherwise moving on to Africa the U.S cooperates in many discussions with the Au and ADB the African growth and opportunity act in 2000 provides preferential cooperation to the U.S market for eligible African countries such as Kenya Nigeria and South Africa and today many African Americans do pilgrimage trips and some even get dual citizenship oh yeah and Liberia was like the US's long-lost adoptive African stepchild that we keep forgetting we really need to pay more attention to them and give them more love when it comes to Europe though basically the US has always had some kind of constant interaction with Europe since the Inception of our nation's Independence France was the first country to establish diplomatic relations with us also thank you for giving us the Statue of Liberty over the years Europeans from virtually every corner of the continent immigrated to the US and built communities and neighborhoods after World War II we signed the Marshall Plan which was a huge economic Recovery Act which eventually evolved into the formation of NATO the only main European relationship that has a roller coaster of diplomatic instability typically lands with Russia rooted in the Cold War era conflict but this is a topic for another time when it comes to our best friends however typically Americans will probably root for one of the teen major anglophone Nations we Americans hardcore crush on the Aussies and Kiwis I personally feel like nothing illustrates this more than the Irwin family we share a history of being former British colonies we are members of anzas the Pacific committee and a partner in the Pacific Islands Forum we share very common political and cultural interests we've almost always teamed up and had each other's backs on numerous International conflicts and yeah overall we love them then we hit a little closer to home and get to Canada and the UK Canada is more like our obedient little brother that stuck with Daddy Britain as we broke away and got our own apartment later on they saw us having so much fun and then kind of slowly and politely requested to leave dad's Nest nonetheless in a technical sense Canada has the oldest shared relationship with us as we were both being formed at the same time so we ultimately really get each other and we share so much in common in regards to culture values and politics we both speak English much to the Chagrin of the quebe about 75 to 85 percent of their trade goes through the USA granted sometimes Canadians hope they don't get too Americanized and they try to salvage their Canadian identity whatever that means but ultimately we love them we marry the crap out of each other we hire their musicians and actors they let us film in Vancouver for super cheap and we love how they hate it when we call them our 51st state finally we end up with the old man UK the US is the Rebel Son that broke away yet after things cooled off we totally laughed about it and became the closest friends all over again today the two countries share the world's largest direct foreign investment partnership and virtually go hand in hand in almost every International issue the UK is like our connection to Europe and recently both countries have affirmed the other as being the country with the most important bilateral partnership in their foreign policy long story short the story ends right where it began the USA and UK will always look out for each other alright the motion graphic is over it's time to do this in conclusion look personally if you're American you're my family we don't always have to agree on everything in fact we might not even like each other we might even kind of hate each other a little bit but the point is if you're an American you're still my family and at the end of the day my family comes first I'll still have your back Nobody messes with my crazy family and if you have a green card it's like you're kind of engaged to my family and I can't wait for the wedding if you're undocumented and you call this country your home and you love it and you work hard and you have good character and want to be a part of the family then I'm rooting for you to take all the necessary steps to join the family and for those of you saying that we have problems yeah of course we have problems we always had problems we always will but look at our history when there was a problem we didn't stick with it grumbling and twiddling our thumbs we openly acknowledged it we erupted a little bit we let things get messy and then we figured things out that's kind of how we do things we're Americans we're still figuring things out and we're not even 300 years old we're just getting started we're not done we're never done we don't stop you're part of a people and nation that has done amazing things the world has never seen before you're part of that amazingness it's like by default you Americans are already unique you're already amazing you just you might not recognize it or feel it but you are we became our own Royals and this is our home and I love you all stay tuned Uruguay is coming up next sorry you have to follow that [Music] foreign .
