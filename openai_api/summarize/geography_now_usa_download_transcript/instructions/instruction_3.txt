huge Hawaiian language Revival because of the creation of Hawaiian emerging schools we have schools for preschool all the way to 12th graders and everything is done in Hawaiian about half a century ago Hawaiian language was at the brink of Extinction with only 2 000 native speakers today in 2023 I'm proud to say there's over 30 000 people speaking our native tongue thank you kamaka follow him on his social medias and his websites he's an awesome guy doing great things for Hawaii otherwise three of the territories also have official bilingual status along with English for their native languages Spanish for Puerto Rico chamoro for Guam and Samoan for American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands is the only officially trilingual entity with chamoro and Carolinian as the official languages alongside with English however as a whole bilingualism has been growing fast in the U.S mostly with Spanish and French as our most commonly taught languages in schools in the 80s our populace was only about 11 bilingual today however that number has more than doubled as the Census Bureau estimates that somewhere around one in five people in the US ages five and up uses another language at home and one in four Americans are proficient enough to Converse in another language in any case religion in the USA regardless of level of devotion somewhere around 70 maybe upwards to 75 claim to be affiliated with some kind of Christian denomination the largest ones being Protestant followed by Catholic and non-denominational otherwise the next largest religious groups are Jews and Buddhists at somewhere around two percent each and then Muslims at around one percent for the rest of the country it's kind of like a complicated topic because they tend to fall into a more agnostic approach in which they might claim to be spiritual but not religious so going back to the topic how did all the Races end up here well to start off of course the originals were the Native Americans in a nutshell they come from numerous tribes that each have their own customs and traditions there are over 570 recognized ones and then of American story of this country is an acknowledged sad one riddled in government mandated relocations mass killings such as the one at the Battle of Wounded Knee and broken treaties all over the place in regard to that though there's also a beautiful side to their story with pride and courage and tribes like the Navajo and Hopi that were honored for their code talker program in World War II and today some tribes like the Cherokee and Osage are starting to revive their languages to more modern usage with things like teaching it in schools putting their tribal scripts on street signs and businesses and windows and documents and so on I've said this before every American needs to visit a tribal reservation at least once and spend time learning about them after that White's from England started coming in from the late 1500s to the early 1600s basically English colonialism after that the Atlantic slave trade from West Africa began with Portugal and eventually made its way to the United States which is where most of our black population is derived from a more contemporary term that some of them might use as or American descendant of Slavery to distinguish themselves from blacks that immigrated from the Caribbean or Africa keep in mind the United States only took in about four percent of the enslaved peoples from the Atlantic slave trade most of them either went to Brazil ill or the Caribbean when it was under the British eventually the Civil War and Emancipation Proclamation happened from there it was still a struggle with a tense time riddled with apartheid laws and customs even in the north where they fought against slavery there was still racism there were Jim Crow laws the bombing of Tulsa the Rosewood incident redlining finally in the 60s the Civil Rights Movement occurred the 60s was kind of like the big moment it is said that slavery and the treatment of Native Americans is the darkest chapter of American History our biggest shame we don't hide from it we acknowledge it we teach it in our schools it's like what the Nazi thing is that Germany or the Imperial thing is to Japan for what it's worth the story of Black America is one with so many chapters but if you look at how the story unfolds over the centuries there is a beauty to it our country could not be what it is with so many amazing individuals that have revolutionized not just our country but made shock waves throughout the whole world look I'm not trying to speak on behalf of the black experience because I'm not black I mean I did that DNA test and it said North African but I'm not claiming anything unless you all approve and if you do I'll bring ribs and Henny to the cookout hey hey but for what it's worth if you must take anything away from this I think most of Americans will agree that the story of America is nothing without the story of the black population in any case from there we move on to the other major communities the Chinese were the first Asians to arrive as rail line workers in the mid-1800s Filipinos started coming in after the colonial years then the Koreans and Vietnamese so the Korean War and the Vietnam War for the Latino Community it's interesting some isolated communities of Mexicans and Spanish people were already living in certain parts of the West after lands were acquired from the Mexican-American War however their populations weren't really high until large migration waves came in in the 20th century from there Latin Americans from all over started building communities Los Angeles has the largest Salvadoran in Guatemalan communities Miami has Cubans Venezuelans Colombians Puerto Ricans and Dominicans Love New York for some reason even though the climate is nothing like their perfect beautiful Tropical Islands I don't get that whole thing but whatever you guys do you and of course when there's Latinos You'll Always Find Mexicans somehow in the mix there's a lot of other groups and stories behind their origins of coming here but we just don't have time this video is already getting long enough if you are from a community that I didn't mention please feel free to write about it in the comments and teach us but otherwise we have to move on in any case one thing you'll notice is that our country tries really really hard to make sure every race has some kind of representation in Media or retail for example major store chains that sell Cosmetics usually have to provide a line that comes in all shades of the skin spectrum and most of them will have what they sometimes call ethnic hair or textured hair or coily hair sections and fun fact art and I actually shop in this part of the store because uh why art Murray's pomade it's the only thing that seems to work on her hair because her hair is thick we always use it so yeah we use this all the time this is a true American classic yeah not a sponsorship which is not a sponsorship we just really like this stuff although it could be a sponsorship first non-black people to be a sponsored by Murray you could use a ginger you would be you would be considered the face of diversity for them since the 70s most of our TV shows and cartoons have had unspoken diversity quotas in which every cast will usually have some minority character either main reoccurring or guest character our toy sections at stores usually contain dolls and action figures that come in all Races nothing more iconic to this sentiment than the famous collectible American Girl doll then you have the really obvious attempts like Captain Planet Magic School Bus and that puppet show that tried too hard like even if it comes off a little forced and pandering or cringy we try our best and usually we mean well in any case that was such a long-winded explanation of American social dynamics one person who also means well and is quite Dynamic would be art so let's switch up the subject and talk about the sports of the USA ah it is all right Artemis hailing from the great state of Washington so let's get started for one let's all go way back to the beginning tribes like the Choctaw Chickasaw and the tribe Creek played chunky which involved rolling a disc and throwing a spear some of the Algonquin tribes played some games similar to soccer called pasakawa kuhog which could have had up to 500 people playing at the same time and yes since this is the USA episode I'm gonna just call it soccer this time soccer and the most famous one that survives to this day and is actually the oldest organized Sports in North America lacrosse fast forward to today and numerous Sports have been invented in our country we love our Sports so much that we even created a sport that cheers on other sports it's called cheerleading ever heard of it oh and one thing almost all schools in the USA have a mascot which is usually a costume character to help cheer on the team and you know you had a real American Experience if your school had to change its mascot due to outdated racist undertones oh yeah my school did that and then we get the big three baseball basketball and American football although some might say baseball was inspired by the game rounders from England the first official formalized version of baseball was created in New York City in 1845 and has become America's pastime Sport and basketball was created in Massachusetts by a Canadian yeah that's true but if you wanted to make it a Canadian sport he would have stayed in Canada we love you Canada though yeah we love you anyway people all over the world know our most famous player of all time Michael Jordan who is a multi-billionaire and never has to worry about life ever again are you serious there you wrote that he set for life yeah let's become billionaires then we get to American football we just call it football sometimes called Gridiron it's our most popular sport it was basically like a sport inspired from rules and techniques found in rugby and soccer invented by Walter Camp in the 1870s and first played by four universities many outside the U.S and Canada might not quite get the sport so if you have to summarize it it's kind of like if you mixed war and speed chess two teams 11 players they have to get to the inside okay let me just describe football really quick okay the chunky fat guys are the right Paul the chunky and fat the linemen on the front and the quarterback is trying to get the ball to whoever that can score touchdown that's basically it and it is a big deal here like a really big deal the Super Bowl today the USA is the most successful Nation at the Olympics holding nearly 3 000 medals about 1200 of which are gold we even have the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time swimmer Michael Phelps we have hosted the Olympics eight times and soon the ninth is going to be here in Los Angeles in 2028. we will also host the 2026 FIFA World Cup and Los Angeles will be a host city as well otherwise we have to bring up a bunch of other Fringe Sports such as running a reindeer and iditary God in Alaska monster truck rallies freestyle Motocross and of course one of our favorite American pastimes entertainment wrestling things like WWF and WWE are Staples of our American diet there is nothing more American than WrestleMania all the superstars and cheesy guest celebrities battle it out and destroy each other we'll destroy each other do they really I mean come on it's so rude it's so real right those are not actors for sure and there are loads of independent lower tier entertainment wrestling leagues in which sometimes get like really weird with like a chicken fights a wizard or a pizza chef and a Green Goblin or a Pop-Tart and a mermaid that sounds like a nightmare actually and that's it for me I'm gonna get out of here you know guys I am so proud to be an American I hope you guys enjoyed the episode and I love you all thank you that was a great way to end it man shut up Paul thank you art I know what is the easiest way to make friends with an American well you have to master the art of the American Interruption let me explain in other countries it's considered rude to listen in on other people's conversations let alone interrupt them while they're talking but here in the USA it's a social art form in a way unless we are quietly Whispering something we kind of don't mind if you hear us and if you hear us talking about something you really understand well and you really feel like you contribute something to the conversation then you are allowed to subtly budge your way into the conversation for example okay do you remember the scare Factor episode where they made him bungee jump and they almost hit them yeah I remember so we're gonna.
