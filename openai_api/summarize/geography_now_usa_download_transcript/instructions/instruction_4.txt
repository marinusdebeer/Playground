eat Blended up the centipede oh my God we're American Best Friends keep in mind this can go both ways for shared interests and shared hatreds yo did you hear that new Blake album no he's not as good as he used to be no are you 2017 no you just be crying do you guys remember that that music video with the girl in like the orange dress like well yeah we're American best friends and look to my fellow Americans I know some of you guys have been through some rough patches in the way how you see yourselves in our country but let me just remind you a few things our country has gone through a lot of crazy things a lot of shameful things in the past but we also have a lot of glory and a lot of accomplishments it's your country just as much as it is mine and you're my family and we get to share in the glory of this country 21 elements on the periodic table were discovered or co-discovered by us and five of them are named after places in our country we absolutely lead the world in space exploration we're the only people that have landed on the moon and we did it six times and played golf on it we sent the first satellite images of other planets like Jupiter Saturn and even Pluto and we were the first to land a Rover on Mars we pioneered the Genome Project and pioneered so many medical advancements we donate more money for charity and aid for people in need across the world than all the other countries combined we have the number one film industry in the world we invented so many things I'm not even gonna get into it and name them all but one of them being personal computers and the internet and YouTube which you would need to watch this video and that's just a small fraction of the Heritage that your nation gets to claim and you and I are a part of it so buck up kiddo no matter how much we fight we're still family in the end and we're all kind of pretty awesome and I guess that's who we are as Americans we're just the Lost Children of the world that made our own thing and that's our heritage and to talk more about how that Heritage is subdivided regionally here's Hannah with the culture segment hello everyone we are at the America episode and you know I have to start it out with a big Roll Tide because you know I am from Alabama Miami and the baby actually the baby's not from Alabama it's from California oh yeah you're gonna have a California baby oh no so when I when I say American culture lots of things probably pop into your head surfing and skateboarding ketchup Branch dressing pickup trucks Cowboys pop and locking shopping scooters shopping scooters yellow school buses drinks with eyes 64 ounce cups red Solo cups gray cans of cheese root beer to go bag carpet floors wearing shoes indoors and so on these are all fun and true to some extent but there's a deeper story behind our people for one culture in the USA is typically divided into five main regions within the lower 48 and micro regions within them so let's start off northeasterners are hustling business folk it is home to the Bosch wash Corridor the largest megalopolis in the world in terms of economic output with about one-sixth of the entire country's population people here live in or have close access to large Metropolitan centers which most likely means they are acquainted with a wide range of ideas opportunities Office Buildings and The Daily Grind of Modern Life funny enough Pennsylvania is also home to the largest on Amish community that chooses to avoid modern technology the Midwest or the Great Lakes region is the industrial and Manufacturing belt the lakes and rivers help them prosper and trade historically Detroit is known for its car industry hence the nickname Motown or Motor City Chicago processes food and Machinery Wisconsin is the dairy capital in fact two of the top three best hospitals in the country and in the world are here overall the Midwest is good at making things and they are famous for having some of the funniest accents and nicest people in the country then we get to the Great Plains and the frontier this is the Bread Basket and mountains of the nation basically this is the resource epicenter after these lands were acquired the U.S government encouraged Westward Expansion to the citizens by implementing the Homestead Act in 1862. so basically this became the wild west if you've seen The Classy kitchy Americana western films this area also has the most Native American reservations as well be respectful to the tribes if you ever enter the land as they have the their own autonomous set of rules that may differ from the state they are in Colorado is known for having the healthiest people in the country Wyoming is one of the few places where you can still see authentic cowboys and cowgirls Utah and Idaho have the heaviest concentration of the Mormon Community Arizona and New Mexico have a desert culture they know how to handle heat and thrive in it then there's the West Coast California Nevada Oregon and Washington basically two things dominate this region entertainment which is literally what we're doing right now on the west coast and Tech Innovation everyone knows Los Angeles is the entertainment capital of the world home to Hollywood where the largest and busiest Studios and production facilities in the world operate up north you start getting Tech hubs like Silicon Valley and Seattle the startup and Innovation centers with companies like Microsoft Apple Google Facebook Twitter and so on everyone knows Vegas in Nevada the largest casino State however not everything is neon lights and Robotics Oregon is where the whole Lumber industry pretty much started and today some of the best Alpine forests are found here so you find more naturey people out in those parts and finally we reach the South my home region the region everyone in the US is moving to right now this is probably the most well-known distinct region of the USA most people whether religious or not have had some kind of affiliation with the church growing up and will find themselves praying even if they are on a reality show intended to Showcase their drunken sexual escapades and that's also because everyone knows the south is the best party place in the country well tangent because a lot of our colleges have the best football teams reasons to celebrate Louisiana is our best kept secret they have the unique Cajun and creole culture that dominates everything there's nothing like Mardi Gras on Bourbon Street but if you want the original and real Mardi Gras you have to go to Mobile Alabama and as much as I hate to admit it the entire State of Florida is kind of a Non-Stop party even hurricanes don't stop them everyone knows the strangest and crazy easiest things happen in Florida I think it's because it's so hot and humid there South Florida is home to Miami which is basically North Cuba it has a unique Caribbean culture literally you need to speak Spanish the Mississippi Delta is where so many famous people like Elvis Presley and Oprah were born you have the Appalachian or Piedmont South where banjo and bluegrass music began and where some of the best moonshine is made along the coasts of North and South Carolina in Georgia you have the unique Gola Community descendants of the freed slaves that inhabit the Barrier Islands they are known for speaking their own unique Creole that has West African influences musical performances and sweet grass woven craft then of course we get to Texas the big guy let's just say Texas is not just a cowboy state it's evolving into a major modern tech and entrepreneur Hub they're tough they're proud and they love their state in Alaska you can actually find bushed communities that live mostly Off the Grid and survive in the elements and prefer bartering instead of using money native Hawaiians invented surfing and they were ocean navigation experts traversing the entire Pacific on canoes micronesians in Guam and the Marianas also have their distinct Chamorro culture and they live by the concepts of emote and manyina American Samoans are obviously the cousins of the Samoans they have their unique matai and chiefdom systems of ruling themselves and the far as Samoa or Samoan way of life the Virgin Islands is like a mini Jamaica they have their own Creole English quelbe or scratch bands amazing seafood and the unique malbe drink made of tree bark Puerto Ricans are kind of like the US's favorite Latinos politics aside they have created so many cultural impacts that have crept onto the mainland especially in places like New York and Florida home of bomba reggaetones everyone knows Robert Clemente Ricky Martin JLo Daddy Yankee and Luis Fonzie so that's the quick condensed overview of the US's Regional cultures there is so much more we could have mentioned but it would take forever if you are from a region of the USA with a distinct cultural trait we miss write it in the comments and teach us I guess with all of that we go back to the crazy Florida region because now it is Florida band Keys time to talk to us about the music take it away crazy Florida man did it that's the America episode okay all right we're in Florida yeah made it to Florida yeah there's even a fight going on outside so that's how you know it's real Florida hey what's up everybody what's up name Keith thanks for having me on the show Paul I'm not trying to sound cocky or anything like that every other country on the face of the Earth deserves its own Spotlight with all that being said we're the number one music Market in the entire world we export more music and entertainment to the rest of the world than any other country ever let but first let's take it back way back to the indigenous people of the United States Native Americans are known for their pow-wow events of you know War drums and dancing and singing and all kinds of really great traditional things along with the Hawaiians who have the luau's and it's pretty amazing too and they got the fire spinning and the Inuits have their traditional throat singing that they perform so the largest Native American powwow event in the United States is called the Gathering of the Nations and you can go check out this event in Albuquerque New Mexico and it's performed every April and I highly recommend you guys go and check it out in Hawaii you have also the Mary Monarch Festival it's like the most Hawaiian thing you can possibly see with your own two eyes unless if you have one eye then you it's the most amazing thing with your one eye now let's fast forward American Music really started to gain its International recognition in the 1800s with things like Vaudeville and acapellas like the fist Jubilee singers who broke barriers and received the national medal of Arts prior to the 20th century American Music was either classical parlor music slash Saloon music all Americans know such songs Like Home on the Range and Oh Susanna by Stephen Foster and then something crazy happened Jess oh my God Jazz there is nothing more American than jazz music a very highly intellectual form of music jazz basically changed the entire world in or helped shape today's modern music I mean you can take you know the chord structures like complex chord structures I mean songs like Giant Steps you literally have every other beat where it changes like a chord to odd time signatures I mean take five was like a very popular Jazz standard that was in by this record uh kind of Blue by Miles Davis Miles Davis set the standard of how good jazz can sound in my opinion but let's be real I mean you also had John Coltrane in his band I mean even at points I mean Bill Evans was on his record today's music wouldn't be anything without Jazz I mean I also want to highlight blues music just as much as Jazz because without Blues as well we wouldn't have had the era of rock and roll people like Howlin Wolf BB King Stevie Ray Vaughan Gary Clark Jr you know without Blues we would have never gotten into eventually having Elvis Presley to the Beyond into the Beatles and Led Zeppelin and everybody's favorite bands at one point it all kind of stems from the blues we can't leave out what was going on in New York City with hip-hop culture so basically it all started with a guy named DJ Cool hurt it took off from there you have Detroit for Motown and how can we forget about Nashville Nashville the main thing that people see is country music but you can just as much go to Indie show and go check out some indie hipster band or go check out a metal band Believe It or Not Nashville has the highest musicians per capita in the entire world Texas was the birthplace of Tejano every Mexican American knows uh Selena and probably has some sort of.
