In a hearing held on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), members of the subcommittee opened with remarks highlighting the pressing need for transparency and openness in discussing UAPs. The Chair and Ranking Member expressed their gratitude towards the witnesses, including military personnel and pilots, for their courage in sharing their experiences and bringing attention to the somewhat controversial issue of UAPs.

There was a consensus amongst the colleagues that the lack of transparency has not only been bewildering to the public but it has also fueled speculation and eroded public trust in government institutions. They noted the establishment of entities such as the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and NASA’s independent study on UAPs, yet they still firmly stress the need for more government-led transparency and accountability. Diverse incidents associated with UAPs, specifically referencing instances such as the Chinese spy balloon incident and subsequent UAP shootdowns, were spotlighted as examples of government opacity. These representatives emphasize the imperative of a discourse and investigation driven not by fear, but knowledge, emphasizing on the pressing need for government openness and efficiency.

Throughout the hearing, these representatives continually express their commitment to objective inquiry, stressing that this debate isn’t merely on the existence of UAPs, but revolves around wider principles of transparency and accountability. There is a strong belief amongst them all that this topic extends beyond party lines, and tackling UAPs holds global importance. As they thank their colleagues for their assistance in making the hearing possible they simultaneously express their gratitude towards the witnesses for their dedication and bravery. 

The attendees recognize the complexities faced while conducting the hearing, specifically acknowledging challenges from the intelligence community and the Pentagon. They express an emphatic desire to uncover the cover-up, to enforce accountability on a government that has been reticent for the longest time. They conclude on the note of the necessity for an open-minded discussion and understanding the implications of UAPs for humanity.

The acknowledgment of the regular occurrence of UAP sightings and inability to obtain adequate reports due to the prevalent stigma became a significant talking point. This lack of reporting has resulted in a hampered understanding of UAPs and created roadblocks in addressing national security concerns related to these phenomena.

Excessive classification of UAP information was another key concern discussed in the hearing. It has been observed that since 2021, all UAP videos are classified as secret or above, leading to a lack of transparency, reduced comprehensive understanding of these sightings and further cultivating mistrust amongst the public.

Lieutenant Ryan Graves, the first witness, brought to light the paramount importance of addressing these aforementioned issues. He shed light on his experience and that of 30 other commercial pilots and military veterans who have encountered UAP sightings, stressing their shared concern over the lack of reporting and the punitive stigma surrounding UAPs. 

The hearing's primary focus was on the call for increased transparency, openness in addressing UAPs and sharing information with the public. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of fair treatment with respect and without fear of reprisal for those who come forward with UAP sightings. The hearing aimed to shed light on the phenomenon of UAPs and to initiate an objective and thoughtful inquiry into these sightings.

The discrepancies between the preparedness of military personnel and commercial pilots to deal with UAP sightings were stark. Mr. Graves stated that while the military has made substantial progress in responding to these encounters, the commercial sector is lagging behind considerably. He put emphasis on the need for the commercial sector to treat UAP encounters with seriousness and to implement necessary measures ensuring the safety of passengers and pilots alike.

Graves highlighted the immediate need for a system to report UAP sightings without fearing professional repercussions. The stigma encircling this topic has deterred pilots from coming forward, leading to scarce reporting. He believes that creating a secure system, reducing the stigma surrounding UAPs, and dissemination of information to the public would significantly encourage pilots to report UAPs.

The biggest challenge to transparency has been the excessive classification of UAP information which impedes the possibility of making these reports public. But Graves pointed out the dire national security concerns surrounding UAP information specifically in relation to the use of advanced sensors and tactical jets for identification. He argues that while the objects themselves may not be classified, there could be valid reasons to classify certain aspects of the information obtained. 

Graves believes that irrespective of this, any UAP-related data that is fifteen years old or older should be declassified, unless it exposes a specific vulnerability in national security. Lieutenant Fravor, who encountered a UAP in 2004, stated that there was a blatant disregard for follow-ups following the incident, further highlighting the need for a central hub to collect and investigate UAP reports from both military and commercial aviation.

During the testimonies, numerous witnesses shared their experiences and observations of UAPs. Mr. Fravor, a former pilot, narrated the details of his encounter with a UAP referred to as the Tic Tac and emphasized on the extraordinary flight capabilities that were beyond current human technological abilities. 

Witnesses shared experiences they had after releasing their testimonies, Mr. Grush faced numerous setbacks and reprisals, including threats of termination. He referred to this as "administrative terrorism," and described his concern for those who may be deterred from divulging information because of such actions.

The witnesses collectively called for a safe and transparent system to report and analyze UAP encounters, and underscored the significance of a secure two-way communication between pilots, operators, and intelligence facilities. Furthermore, they believed that civilians who have UAP encounters should also have a reporting process ideally using sensor-centric operations for objectivity.

Overall, the need for a secure, transparent reporting system was emphasized to encourage reports that could help understand and respond to UAP encounters better for the sake of national security. The insinuation from the witnesses was that the maneuvers and behaviors of the UAPs they encountered represent a phenomenon that is beyond our scope of known technology, inducing a potential national security threat.

During the hearing, various aspects related to the examination and reporting of UAPs were brought forth by the witnesses. They discussed the rampant concern about pilots facing cease and desist letters after reporting UAP sightings, reflecting how corporate reputation was being prioritized over public safety.

The appearance of the UAPs was also the subject of discussion, they were described as spherical with no visible windows or seams. Witnesses believed that the extraordinary flight capabilities observed defy the laws of physics and suggested the existence of a disinformation campaign led by the U.S. government to deny the existence of certain UAPs.

NASA's role and the potential impact they can have in the commercial and other sectors of industries with their researches on UAPs was another significant topic of conversation. They mentioned the establishment of the Galileo Project at Harvard University and how empowering military pilots to share their UAP experiences was leading to increased meaningful scientific research.

In this section of the hearing, questions and answers were exchanged about UAP sightings and their plausible threat to national security. The exchanges underlined the urgency for creating a secure system to encourage reporting, understanding, and response to UAP encounters with a significant emphasis on national security purposes.

In conclusion, the representatives expressed their gratitude to the witnesses for their testimony and highlighted the importance of continued investigations. They emphasized fraternity in taking collective actions, acknowledging the bipartisan nature of the discussion, and role of the media in responsibly reporting on the UAP topic. The committee also acknowledged the immense role of their office staff in organizing the hearing, and expressed anticipation for legislation that may rise as a result of the hearing.
