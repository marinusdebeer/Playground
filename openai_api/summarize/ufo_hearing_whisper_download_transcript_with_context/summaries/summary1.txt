The witnesses for the subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) are introduced, including Lieutenant Ryan Graves, David Grush, and retired Navy Commander David Fravor. The Chair emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in government efforts regarding UAPs, as well as the importance of public support. The lack of government transparency and classification of documents has led to public skepticism and belief in a government cover-up. The Ranking Member expresses gratitude to the witnesses and emphasizes the seriousness and transparency of the proceedings. He also highlights the need for open-mindedness and the importance of whistleblowers in providing information on UAPs. The Chair then introduces the witnesses and reminds them of the time limits for their opening statements.
