It's a topic that has interested me since I was in school. It was a very illuminating hearing. Obviously, I think several of us are going to look forward to getting some answers in a more confidential setting. I assume some legislation will come out of this. Sure. I apologize, Mr. Chairman. I need to compliment the folks in my office that did a lot of the work on this. Rachel and Noah sitting behind me here, they're very quiet and humble. But without them, this thing would not have come off like it did. So I apologize. Thank you. I think we're going to want to look into what we can do. to make more of this information public. I think there's certainly a time period after which it should always be made public and people have been concerned about these issues, like I said, since I was in high school. But in any event, I'd like to thank everybody who was here sticking through the entire hearing. Without objection, the members will have five legislative days to submit materials and to submit additional written questions for the witnesses, which we forward to the witnesses for their response. If there's no further business, without objection, the subcommittee stands adjourned. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
