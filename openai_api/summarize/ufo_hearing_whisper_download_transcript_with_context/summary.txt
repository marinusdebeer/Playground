The subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) commenced with the Chair welcoming the participants. The Chair and Ranking Member were each allocated 10 minutes for their opening remarks. The Chair began by expressing gratitude to the military personnel who had courageously shared their encounters with UAPs. The Chair stressed that the lack of transparency from the government regarding UAPs in the past unnecessarily fueled speculations and eroded public trust.

The Chair highlighted the establishment of the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and NASA's independent study as steps in the right direction. However, the Chair emphasized the need for greater transparency and accountability in these efforts and criticized instances where the government did not truthfully address UAPs. As an example, the Chair mentioned the improper handling of the Chinese spy balloon incident. 

Representative Burchett spoke next, expressing his gratitude to various colleagues and witnesses for their involvement. Noting the nonpartisan view of the issue, Burchett echoed the Chair's sentiments on government transparency and stated plainly that the American people deserved answers about UAPs.

Following Burchett was Representative Luna who further emphasized the need for a more transparent government. Luna noted that the public had been captivated by UAPs for decades and asserted that the lack of transparency and classification of documents had led many to believe in a government conspiracy. Citing polls that showed growing public skepticism, she criticized the handling of UFO reports and underscored the need for an open-minded discussion.

The Ranking Member offered his gratitude to the witnesses and praised their courage for speaking out on UAPs. He seconded Representative Burchett's leadership and thanked the subcommittee members for their interest in the issue. He also thanked the oversight staff for organizing the hearing and reiterated the seriousness and transparency of the proceedings. 

Among the witnesses were Lieutenant Ryan Graves, David Grush, and retired Navy Commander David Fravor. These witnesses highlighted the dire need for a system where pilots could safely report UAP encounters without fear of professional backlash. They expressed alarm at the current absence of a proper reporting system and pointed out that previous limitations in reporting resulted in a dearth of data regarding UAPs.

These witnesses also touched on concerns about national security and the potential threats posed by UAPs. They argued for a centralized location to gather and investigate UAP reports, stressing transparency, accountability, and the need to regain public trust. They presented detailed descriptions of UAP maneuvers and behaviors that sit outside the boundaries of current technology and understanding. 

They went on to postulate that the government was in possession of UAPs, a belief rooted in thorough interviews with witnesses. In response, the Representatives voiced their support for a reporting system and emphasized the importance of civilian reporting and involvement in understanding these phenomena.

Continuing the discussions, the witnesses recounted instances of retaliation and reprisals for coming forward with their testimonies. They stressed the involvement of civilian reporting and of defense contractors in UAP-related programs and activities. They pushed for a notification process and specific characteristics to be included in reports on UAP sightings. There was a unanimous agreement among the witnesses on the impact of UAPs on training ranges and on the urgent steps Congress can take to address this issue.

Furthermore, they discussed the 2019 classification guidelines for UAPs and expressed the urgent need for transparency with the public. They shared their experiences with UAP incidents and the challenges faced when reporting them. Notably, they mentioned the possibility of interdimensional phenomena and scenarios where sensor and collection systems were disabled by UAPs.

Ending the discussion on a strong note, the witnesses and representatives emphasized the importance of changing the culture of reporting and providing secure facilities for discussing sensitive information. To ensure the pursuit of answers, they proposed enacting legislations stemming from the discussions. The witnesses expressed their hopes of getting answers in a more confidential setting, and thanked the staff and their colleagues for their pivotal role in the hearing. Lastly, additional materials and written questions for the witnesses were requested to be submitted within five legislative days. With that accomplished, the subcommittee adjourned the hearing and extended their gratitude to all the participating witnesses.
