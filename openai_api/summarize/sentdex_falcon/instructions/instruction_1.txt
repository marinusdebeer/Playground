Please provide a detailed summary of the following: 
training data for Falcon 40b was code specifically but another five percent of training data comes from conversational sources like Reddit and stack Overflow where code is often discussed and shows up uh and then there's a web crawl which also is likely to contain a lot of code so there's a good amount of code in here but it's certainly not close to being the majority the first programming example I'll show here is a regular expression question and it's in the format of next line predictions in an attempt to Simply continue the sequence much like copilot might do for you in vs code and if it's not clear the Yellow Part here is the prompt and the cyan is the model's output in this case it gets the hint for my comment again much like I might do with copilot for example and it proceeds to generate the regular expression extract the prices from the text and even print them out for me completely in line with what you might expect the model to generate and this is indeed what I would have wanted next we might instead enjoy a more conversational approach to the same sorts of problems so here we've got the same exact problem just in a more q a format in this format you might prefer it purely because maybe you you want an explanation like maybe from the model here or maybe you just want it to feel more like a teacher than a code generator and give the more kind of friendly feeling to the user it really just depends what your use case is and here I'm just showing and these are both from Falcon 40b instruct but I'm just kind of showing that you know again you can you can do this you can do so many things here it doesn't just have to be necessarily a back and forth all right so one more slightly more complicated programming example uh one of my latest projects is called term GPT which is a project aimed at getting a GPT model to take some sort of General objective as a prompt and then output actual terminal commands that could be run even including with like os.system to actually achieve whatever that prompt was so this includes things like yes writing code but also executing commands executing that code installing packages Reading Writing files and so on I have a whole video covering this as well so feel free to check that out if you're interested I did it using gbd4 up to this point but I would very much like to use an open source model instead and Falcon 40b is looking like it's at least it's very close to achieve this with Falcon 40b I first pass a pre-prompt with a One-Shot example showing just what I would like the agent to respond with sort of like the essentially the same thing I did with the term GPT video but then in this case I don't actually have to have the user specify next because it's it's not required of me to do like this like back and forth so in this case I just have the user suggest an objective and then term GPT or Falcon 40b in this case just suggests command command command command command so the pre-prompt shows an example of basically what I would like and then the prompt the actual user objective here is in that yellow and then cyan is what the model's output actually was the idea here is that a user would input that yellow part and they wouldn't even see or really be they wouldn't know about the white part it would just be kind of in the back end essentially I mean they could know about it but they're not going to mess with that part it's just passed there to sort of guide the model to understand how to structure its response and then later we can pull apart that response and quite literally execute those commands just like I did in term GP so as you can see the output is it's so close to what we would want it really just makes this one small mistake of trying to create that home.html template file in the templates directory which is correct that is where we want it we do want that file we do need that file that file is correct but we never made that directory so in the attempt to make this file inside of that directory it's going to fail if we did just do a maketer that directory this would have worked and I think this is an example of where gpd4 is better than Falcon 40b it just simply doesn't make small mistakes like this as often it can it totally can but just not nearly as often and something as simple as this gpd4 does solve out of the box but Falcon 40b at least for my testing both here and just in general I dare say Falcon 40b is actually better than gbd 3.5 I also Suspect with respect to term GPT in general I think with more time working on a pre-prompt I could probably iron out these problems um and and for example gpt4's Behavior has actually already changed on me multiple times while I'm trying to develop term GPT some of this is like after the fact post-processing and kind of like double checking the answer and then some of that is also the the actual underlying list I call it foundational model has also changed now over time that is going to keep happening and you can specify an older model but I want to say they are just supporting like the single previous model and after that it's gone and you can't get it again so you spent all this time really like honing in and fine tuning and getting things just the way that you want them to work and then the model changes or the model doesn't even change but clearly something something else has changed they've changed some of that post-processing heuristic stuff and it just isn't working the way that you want it anymore and that's super frustrating whereas here with this model you can just depend now it's not a deter it's not totally deterministic but you can depend if you need it to you can depend on those weights being frozen they are not going to change on you in any post-processing heuristics that's up to you so you can depend on that stuff will not change on you but if I want to actually fine tune it specifically to this new use case guess what I can actually do that too it's my model and I just might like I was saying earlier the tii or Technology Innovation Institute is actually currently right now has an open call for proposals for ideas that you might use to on top of the Falcon 40b model and they're looking to essentially issue grants of ten thousand to a hundred thousand dollars in GPU compute power uh to people who have ideas about how they want to leverage this exact model so something like term GPT and I might end up submitting my own literally for that to fine tune it to be exactly what I want and my suspicion is just with a little bit of fine tuning I think Falcon 4 40b can be better than gpt4 is right now and again at the end of the day it's my model I can do whatever the heck I want and I don't have to submit my queries to open AI anymore and I just that's that's pretty cool so with my very anecdotal experience so far uh I am very cautious to say but I do think it's actually true uh that Falcon 40b seems to actually be better than GPT 3.5 the base chat GPT model struggle with saying this purely because Falcon 40b is such a small model relative to GPT 3.5 if if Falcon 40b was only available via like API or some web user interface I simply would not believe that the outputs were from a 40 billion parameter model alone I would just think something else was going on like more heuristics on top and stuff like that like gpd4 does but since we can actually download the weights ourselves we can clearly see no this is just the raw model output and it's already this good which is very impressive I very much look forward to the forthcoming paper on the Falcon models and training them and stuff I'm super curious to see what techniques were used in the actual training and the data set I'm also confident in saying the Falcon 40b model out of the box is just simply not as good as the current you know gbt4 via the API or the web user interface but we also do know that gpg 4 isn't just a model like this it's a model with a bunch of heuristics on top of it to make it quite powerful and rumor has it that it's actually more like eight 220 billion parameter models essentially in an ensemble or something like that we we know and have some ideas about some of those heuristics also used from like the rbrms for example that were shared in the open AI paper on gbd4 but not all and everything is rumored we really just don't know the only thing we do know with a large degree of certainty is that gpd4 is not just simply raw model output from a single model and nothing else so based on my experience so far with Falcon 40b I would suggest that if we like allow ourselves to run Falcon 40b with things like maybe rule-based reward models or something like that like forms and sort of Sanity checks on output and kind of double checking or and detecting things like is this a math problem show your work if so you know that sort of stuff um that I think is pretty clear that gpt4 is using heavily I all I suspect just in the response time it could be based on load but there are certain times where you ask a question and it truly feels like you ask a question to gpd4 and you should have already got an answer back but you didn't but then you get this like careful answer back and it my suspicion again I don't know this stuff but it feels like you're asking a question of gpd4 it probably generated an output and then there's another model that sanity checks that output and if there's something that it detects as possibly problematic it sends it in like a form with a bunch of questions and the model literally answers those answers those questions and maybe changes the response a little bit so my best guess is the gpt4 model sometimes gets queried multiple times from a single user query um and I again I think if we if we did the same thing with Falcon 40b I think we would likely get far more even even more now than we're already getting we give far more performance out of that model and it could be pretty comparable to gpt4 which is insane to think about but even if you couldn't you can still fine-tune Falcon 40b for example to your own specific use case and in that in that way you are highly likely to wind up with a better model to do whatever it is you're trying to do then gpd4 would be and at the end of the day it's yours it's an open source model it's yours so check out the tii call for proposals if you have any big ideas that you'd like to try and then also check out the neural networks from scratch book at nnfs.io if you're interested in learning more about neural networks and how they work otherwise I will see you all in the next video .
