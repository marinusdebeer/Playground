Please provide a detailed (keep as much detail as possible) summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
During a hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), questions were raised regarding the level of security clearance needed to access UAP-related programs, potential disinformation campaigns by the U.S government, and the involvement of private corporations. It was suggested that hearings like this could help reduce the stigma surrounding the topic, stimulate interest, and generate solutions. Discussion revolved around the need for scientific and engineering expertise to address the UAP issue, raising the idea that it's not solely a national security problem. The interaction of defence contractors with UAP programs was also explored with no clear procedures identified for reporting UAP encounters. The essential nature of strengthening scientific and inter-agency collaboration in approaching this issue was emphasized. Moreover, the importance of establishing an official process for reporting UAP sightings, particularly by commercial pilots, was underlined. The discussion also included a review of specific UAP incidents, including the famous Phoenix Lights case in Arizona in 1997.

my colleague from New York Miss ocasio-cortez if we wanted to find out more about that where would we go to find the files and who where and who would we address and are you gonna tell me we need to go to this gift so you can tell us in this gift I could potentially give you a vector on that that specific case I'm not I mean I'm familiar with it in terms of public but uh I I give you a vector in closed environment yeah that would be good thank you so if if it's true that uaps are having an impact on training ranges and this Administration considers it to be a legitimate issue what steps can Congress take to address training range impacts and I say that having two very large training ranges in my state and so we'll start with Mr gravesen going down the panel some of the initial procedures have been implemented such as within the United States Navy that have a range Fowler report that gathers information from Pilots I understand that a service-wide reporting mechanism is still pending however that would be a great Next Step not only for gathering information but for showing the troops that is an acceptable topic and reducing the stigma okay please all of you continue yeah as a recipient of a lot of those training range reports sometimes we only get contextual kind of oral reporting it'd be nice if they attached all sensor data and there's a system in place that can handle multiple classifications of data and that's an issue with the F-35 right that jet was never built to be an ISR platform and it's a pain in the we'll say but to get that data off so yeah great thank you yeah I would agree with the previous two being a user of those training ranges that the data has to be out there you have to acknowledge that you're seeing them and then you have to collect the data right now you get the report someone says I saw something but no one collects the radar data to back it up and do research okay do you believe that the 2019 classification guidelines for uip's interferes with the federal government's ability to be transparent with the American people and do you think we need to be more transparent with the American people all of you yeah I'll say yes to that familiar with the the at least the UAP task force 2019 security classification guide I think it's fair um I did actually help uh author that with the oh yeah you got a bias that way but I will say uh I'll call it a lazy attitude about declassifying videos I mean I've seen some of the videos of you know the recent shoot down and I saw no reason that couldn't have been released as long as they mask you know some data the American people deserve to see that that imagery and full motion video uh I would think well in my opinion I will say things are overclassified I know for a fact the video or the pictures that came out in the 20 things 2020 report that had the stuff off the east coast they were taken with an iPhone off the east coast a buddy of mine was one of the senior people there and he said they're originally classified a tssci and my question to him was what's tssci about these they're an iPhone right literally off the vacapes that's not tssci so they're over classified and as soon as they do that they go in a vault and then you all have to look for them yeah so with the over classification that may be one way are there other ways that the dod or intelligence agencies are keeping this information from the American people or even from Congress I think part of that has been uh not encouraging reporting if the problem is not something that can be measured it's not something that's going to be fixed okay very good with I'm out of time and I thank you Mr chairman and now you'll bet uh first of all without objection representative Nick Langworthy of New York has waved on the subcommittee for purpose of questioning Witnesses in today's subcommittee hearing and then we go to Mr Burleson thank you Mr chairman um appreciate you guys coming out today testifying look I've been here for six months and I'm pretty skeptical I don't trust anything in this town and um and so I and I think that's because I'm from Missouri you've got to show me right um with that being said um there's been a lot of things that have been said um in in the public uh Mr grush and and so I want to get down this if we can some specifics right so um at one point you had said that they're they're they're uh has been harmful activity or Progressive activity has any of the activity um been aggressive been hostile in your reports uh I know of multiple colleagues of mine that got physically injured and uh the activity and I had to if I buy uaps or buy people within the federal government both okay so there has been activity by by alien or non-non-human technology and or beings that has caused harm to humans uh I can't get into the specifics in an open environment but at least the activity that I personally witnessed not to be very careful here because you don't you know they tell you never to acknowledge tradecraft right so what I personally witness myself and my wife was very disturbing okay um one of my constituents actually sent this next question and I figured I'd ask it since I had the same thought you've said that U.S and has intact spake spacecraft you said that the government has alien bodies or alien species have you seen have you have you seen the spacecraft I have to be careful to describe what I've seen firsthand and not in this environment but I could answer that question behind behind closed doors and have you seen any of the bodies that's something I've I've not witnessed myself okay and so with that being said you know and the other statement that has been made that was intriguing to me because and it's intriguing because my my view has been that we are billions of light years away from any any other system and the concept that an alien species that's technologically advanced enough to travel billions of light years gets here and somehow is incompetent enough to not survive Earth or crashes is is something that I find a little bit far-fetched and with that being said you have mentioned that there's interdimensional potential could you expound on that oh yeah to answer your first question and you know I'm here as a fact witness an expert but I will give you a a theoretical framework at least to work off to kind of expose uh crashes uh regardless of uh you know your level of sentience right you know planes crash cars crash and number of sorties what however High a small percentage are going to end in you know Mission failure if you will as we say in the air force uh and then in terms of uh multi-dimensionality that kind of thing the the framework that I'm familiar with for example is something called the holographic principle uh both uh it's it drives itself from general relativity and quantum mechanics and that is if you want to imagine uh 3D objects such as yourself casting a shadow onto a 2d surface that's the holographic principle so you can be projected quasi-projected from higher dimensional space to lower dimensional it's a scientific Trope that you can actually cross literally as far as I understand but there's probably guys with phds that we can probably argue about that but you have not seen any documentation that that's what's occurring uh only a theoretical framework discussion okay um okay Occam's razor my is that this these aircraft um have they been identified that they are being produced by by domestic um you know military and um contractors is there any evidence that that's what's being recovered uh not to my knowledge plus the recoveries predate a lot of our Advanced programs that I previously I'm witting of so um would it be safe to say that there could be a scenario today where you have an aircraft that crashes and because it's been involved in one program from One Federal agency and the but the but the agency that retrieves it is not aware of that program and to them it appears alien in origin I mean that's a hypothetical situation I'm not aware of any uh historical situation that would match that that you described so you're not aware it has not happened that you're aware of that I'm aware of um thank you Mr chairman I yield back several months ago my office received a protected disclosure from Eglin Air Force Base indicating that there was a UAP incident that required my attention I sought a briefing regarding that episode and brought with me congressman burchett and congresswoman Luna we asked to see any of the evidence that had been taken by flight crew in this endeavor and to observe any radar signature as long as as well as to meet with the flight crew we were not afforded access to all of the flight crew and initially we were not afforded access to images and to radar thereafter we had a bit of a discussion about how authorities flow in the United States of America and we did see the image and we did meet with one member of the flight crew who took the image the image was of something that I am not able to attach to any human capability either from the United States or from any of our adversary and I'm somewhat informed on the matter having served on the armed services committee for seven years having served on the committee that oversees DARPA and Advanced Technologies for several years um when we spoke with the flight crew and when he showed us the photo that he'd taken I asked why the video wasn't engaged why we didn't have a FLIR system that worked here's what he said they were out on a test mission that day over the Gulf of Mexico and when you're on a test mission you're supposed to have clear air space not supposed to be anything that shows up and they saw a sequence of four craft in a clear diamond formation for which there is a radar sequence that I and I alone have observed in the United States Congress one of the pilots goes to check out that diamond formation and sees a large floating what I can only describe as an orb again like I said not of any human capability that I'm that I'm aware of and when he approached he said that his radar went down he said that his flear system malfunctioned and that he had to manually take this image from one of the lenses and it was not automatic automated in collection as you would typically see in a test mission so uh I guess I'll start with Commander fraver what in how should we think about the fact that this craft that was approached by our pilot uh had the capability of disarming a number of the sensor and collection systems on that craft well I think this goes to that National Security side and you can go back through history of things showing up in certain areas and disabling our capabilities which is disheartening and for us I mean like I said it it completely disabled the radar and aircraft when I try to do it the only way we could see it is passively which is how he got that image so I think that's a that's a concern on what are these doing not only how do they operate but their capabilities inside to do things like this and and how should we think about for craft moving in a very clear formation equidistant from one another in a diamond in all of the phenomenon perhaps Mr grave that you've analyzed um have we ever seen multiple craft in a single formation I have one particular case and that was uh during the gimbal incident the recording on the at FLIR system shows a single object that rotates um you hear the pilots refer to a fleet of objects that is not visible on the FLIR system and that was something that I witnessed during the debrief as part of the radar data on the situational awareness page I would like to add whoever Congressman there's a small uh small bit of a uh anger I would say I would feel that those Pilots are still uh facing that difficulty in reporting this topic and they don't have the tools to be able to mitigate this issue it just goes to show how serious this is and why this is such an important issue for our pilots and foreign Nation it was stated explicitly to me by these test pilots that if you have a u of AP experience the best thing you can do for your career is forget it and not tell anyone because any type of reporting either above the surface or below the surface does have a perceived consequence to these
