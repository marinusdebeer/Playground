Please provide a detailed (keep as much detail as possible) summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
The subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs is underway. The chair emphasizes the importance of transparency and the need for a bipartisan approach to address national security concerns. The lack of information and stigma surrounding UAPs has hindered reporting and investigation of these occurrences. The witnesses testifying today have firsthand experience with UAPs and will provide unique perspectives. The American public has a right to know and understand these phenomena, and government agencies must be more open in sharing information. Congressional involvement is necessary to ensure accountability and transparency.

but fuels speculation and mistrust in 2014 I was an F-18 foxtrot pilot in the Navy fighter attack Squadron 11 the red Rippers and I was stationed at NAS Oceana in Virginia Beach after upgrades were made to our Jets radar systems we began detecting unknown objects operating in our airspace at first we assume they were radar errors but soon we began to correlate the radar tract with multiple onboard sensors including infrared systems eventually through Visual ID during a training mission in morning area whiskey 72 10 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach two F-18 Super Hornets were split by UAP the object described as a dark gray or a black Cube inside of a clear sphere came within 50 feet of the lead aircraft and was estimated to be 5 to 15 feet in diameter the mission Commander terminated the flight immediately and returned base our Squadron submitted a safety report but there was no official acknowledgment of the incident and no further mechanism to report the sightings soon these encounters became so frequent that aircrew would discuss the risk of UAP as part of their regular pre-flight briefs recognizing the need for action and answers I founded Americans for safe Aerospace the organization has since become a heaven for UAP Witnesses who were previously unspoken due to the absence of a safe intake process more than 30 Witnesses have come forward in almost 5 000 Americans have joined us in the fight for a transparency at safe aerospace.org the majority of Witnesses are commercial pilots at majority major airlines often they are veterans with Decades of flying experience Pilots are reporting UAP at altitudes that appear above them at forty thousand feet potentially in low earth orbit or in the gray Zone below the Carmen line making inexplainable Maneuvers like right-hand turns and retrograde orbits or j-hooks sometimes these reports are reoccurring with numerous recent sightings north of Hawaii and in the north of Atlantic other veterans are also coming forward to us regarding UAP Encounters in our airspace and oceans the most compelling involved observations of UAP by multiple Witnesses and sensor systems I believe these accounts are only scratching the surface and more will share their experiences once it is safe to do so in closing I recognize the skepticism surrounding this topic if everyone could see the sensor and video data I witnessed our national conversation would change I urge us to put a size stigma and address the security and safety issue this topic represents if you appear foreign drones it is an urgent national security problem if it is something else is an issue for science in either case unidentified objects are concerned for flight safety the American people deserve to know what is happening in our skies it is long overdue thank you Mr Rush Mr chairman ranking members and congressmen thank you I'm happy to be here this is an important issue and I'm grateful for your time my name is David Charles grush I was an intelligence officer for 14 years in the both in the U.S Air Force both active duty Air National Guard and Reserve at the rank of major and most recently from 2021 to 2025 or excuse me 2023 at the National geospatial Intelligence Agency NGA at the gs-15 civilian level which is the military equivalent of a full bird colonel I was my agency's co-lead and unidentified anomalous phenomena and transmedium object analysis as well as reporting to the UAP task force uaptf and eventually once it was established the all domain anomaly resolution office Arrow I became a whistleblower through a PPD 19 urgent concern filing in May 2022 with the intelligence Community Inspector General following concerning reports from multiple esteemed and credentialed current and former military and intelligence Community individuals that the U.S government is operating with secrecy above Congressional oversights with regards to uaps my testimony is based on information I've been given by individuals with a long-standing track record of legitimacy and service to this country many of whom also have shared compelling evidence in the form of photography official documentation and classified oral testimony to myself and many my various colleagues I have taken every step I can to collaborate this evidence over a period of four years while I was with the UAP task force and do my due diligence on the individual sharing it this is because of these steps I believe strongly in the importance of bringing this information before you I am driven by a commitment of both to truth and transparency rooted in our inherent duty to uphold the United States Constitution and protect the American people I'm asking Congress to hold our government to the standard and thoroughly investigate these claims but as I stand here under oath now I am speaking to the facts as I have been told them in the U.S Air Force in my national reconnaissance office nro Reserve its capacity I was a member of the UAP task force from 2019 to 2021. I served at the interro operations center on the director's briefing staff which included the coordination of the presidential Daily Brief and supporting variety of contingency operations which I was the reserve Intelligence Division Chief back up in 2019 the UAP task force director asked me to identify all special access programs and controlled access programs also known as saps and caps we needed to satisfy our congressionally mandated Mission and we were direct report at the time to the depth sect deaf at the time due to my extensive executive level intelligence support duties I was cleared to literally all relevant compartments and in a position of extreme trust both in my military and civilian capacities I was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program uh to which I was denied access to those additional read-ons when I requested it I made the decision based on the data I collected to report this information to my Superior superiors and multiple inspectors General and in effect becoming a whistleblower as you know I've suffered retaliation for my decision but I am hopeful that my actions will ultimately lead to a positive outcome of increased transparency thank you and I'm happy to answer your questions thank you uh Commander favor thank you thank you Mr chairman Congressman Connor's women um I want to first thank you for the invitation to speak to the committee on the UAP topic that has been in the news for the past six years and seems to be continuing to gain momentum as you know my name is David fraver I'm retired commander in the United States Navy in 2004 I was a commanding officer of Strike Fighter Squadron 41 the world famous Black Aces if you're a test to carrier airing 11 station on board the USS Nimitz and have begun a two-month workup cycle off the coast of California on this day we were scheduled for a 2v2 area training with the USS Princeton as our control when we launched off knits my wingman was joining up we were told that the training was going to be suspended and we're doing we're going to proceed with real world tasking as we proceeded to the West here controller was counting down the range to an object that we were going to and we were unaware of what we were going to see when we arrived their uh the controller told us that these objects had been observed for over two weeks coming down from over 80 000 feet rapidly descending to 20 000 feet hanging out for hours and then going straight back up for those who don't realize above 80 000 feet is space we arrived at the location at approximately 20 000 feet in a controller called merge plot which means that our radar blip was now in the same resolution cell as the contact as we looked around we noticed that we saw some white water off our right side it's important to note the weather on this day was as close to perfect as you could ask for off the coast of San Diego clear skies light winds calm seas no White Caps from waves so the White Water stood out in a large Blue Ocean all four of us because we were in f-18fs so we had pilots and wizo in the back seat looked down a small saw white Tic Tac object with a longitudinal axis pointing North South and moving very abruptly over the water like a ping pong ball there were no rotors no rotor wash or any sign of visible control surfaces like wings as we started clockwise towards the object My Wizard and I decided to go down and take a closer look at the other aircraft staying in High cover to observe both us and the Tic Tac we proceeded around the circle about 90 degrees from the start of our descent and the object object suddenly shifted its longitudinal axis aligned it with my aircraft and began to climb we continued down another 270 degrees nose low where the Tic Tac or we consumed 270 degrees toward and we went nose load where the Tic Tac would have been our altitude at this point was about 15 000 feet and the Tic Tac was about 12 000. as we pulled nose onto the object within about a half mile of it it rapidly accelerated in front of us and disappeared our wing men roughly 8 000 feet above us lost contact also we immediately turned back to see where the white water was at and it was gone also so as you started to turn back towards the east the controller came up and said sir you're not going to believe this but that thing is at your cat Point roughly 60 miles away in less than a minute you can calculate the speed we returned to Nimitz we were taking off our gear we were talking to one of my Cruisers getting ready to launch we mentioned it to them and they went out and luckily got the video that you see that 90 second video what you don't see is the radar tape that was never released and we don't know where it's at of the act of jamming that the object put on an apg-73 radar and I can get into modes later if you're interested what is shocking to us is that the incident was never investigated none of my crew ever questioned tapes were never taken and after a couple days it turned into a great story with friends it wasn't until 2009 until Jay Stratton had contacted me to investigate unbeknownstall he was part of the atip program and the Pentagon led by louisando and there was an official official report that came out that's now on the internet years later I was contacted by the other pilot Alex Dietrich and asked if I'd been contacted and I said no but I'm willing to talk I was contacted by Mr Elizondo and we talked for a short period of time and he said we'd be in contact a few weeks after that I was made a word that lewd left the Pentagon in protest and joined forces with Tom Delong Chris melon Steve Justice and others to form two stars Academy an organization that pressed the issue with leading industry experts and U.S government officials they worked with Leslie Keane who was present today Rob Blumenthal and Helene Cooper to publish the articles in the New York Times 2017 New York Times and it removed the stigma on the topic of UFOs which is why we're here today those articles opened the door for the government and public that cannot be closed it has led to an interest from our elected officials who are not focused on Little Green Men but figuring out where these crafts are where they from the technology they possess how do they operate it also led to the Whistleblower protection act in the ndaa there are multiple Witnesses coming forward to say uh that have first-hand knowledge and Mr grush has covered that what concerns me is that there's no oversight from our elected officials on anything associated with our government processing or working on Craft I believe not from this world this issue is not a full public disclosure that could undermine National Security but it is about ensuring that our system of checks and balances Works across all work done in the government using taxpayer funds relative to government programs even unacknowledged wave programs have some level of oversight by the appropriate committee members in the House and Senate and this work that is said to be occurring from whistleblower testimonies should not be exempt in closing I would like to say that the Tic Tac object we engaged in 2004 was far superior to anything that we had on time have today or looking to develop in the next 10 years if we in fact have programs that possess this technology and needs to have oversight from those people that the citizens of this great country elected an office to represent what is best for the United States and best for the citizens I thank you for your time thank you very much thank you very much and it was very difficult for all of you all you've done in the past to try to illuminate this issue calling myself first for some questions I'm going to start with Mr graves are your Pilots our Pilots that you interact with as
