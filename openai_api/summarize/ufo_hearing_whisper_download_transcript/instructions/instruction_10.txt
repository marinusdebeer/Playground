In the UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) inquiry by Congress, key witnesses suggested that more streamlined reporting systems and open platforms that ensure no retribution should be established, while questioning the hindrance by current classification guidelines. Two cases underlining the potential national security threats where pilots experienced technical failures during UAP encounters were highlighted. Theoretical frameworks such as the holographic principle were suggested for understanding inter-dimensional attributes of UAP, with the issue calling for scientific and inter-agency collaboration. Witnesses Mr Graves, Mr Gresh and Mr Favor were thoroughly questioned on unreported sightings, classified weapons testing, existing protocols for verified encounters, and potential possession of extraterrestrial crafts and biologics.   In the subsequent Q&A session, members of Congress grilled the witnesses on the safety of personnel involved in reverse engineering programs, whistleblower complaints handling, the terminology used to describe these phenomena and possible foreign policy implications. The potential occurrence of white-collar crimes in possible cover-ups was also raised. Witnesses were also asked to share their experiences, attitudes, and conclusions from their encounters with these unexplained phenomena. Sharing their motivations for being part of the inquiry, the witnesses largely cited their sense of duty and desire to contribute to the reporting and understanding of UAPs. They expressed the need for more public avenues to report sightings and for witnesses to maintain factual accuracy while refraining from speculation. The session concluded with members of Congress acknowledging the importance and seriousness of the hearing and expressing gratitude to the witnesses for their courage and insights.
