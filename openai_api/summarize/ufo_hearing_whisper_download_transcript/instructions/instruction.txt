The subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs is about to begin. The chair welcomes everyone and announces the members of the subcommittee who will be participating. The lack of transparency regarding UAPs has fueled speculation and eroded public trust. Congress has established entities to examine UAPs, but there are pressing demands for government transparency and accountability. The Biden Administration's handling of a Chinese spy balloon incident and the lack of clarity on UAP work from the Department of Defense are concerning. The subject of UAPs requires a careful data-driven approach, and today's hearing aims to provide clarity on improving reporting and government efficiency. Representative Burchett emphasizes that this is a nonpartisan issue and thanks his colleagues and the witnesses. He acknowledges the difficulties in organizing the hearing and expresses the need for government transparency and an end to the cover-up. Representative Luna highlights the captivation and belief of the American people in UAP sightings. She criticizes the lack of transparency and assurance for service members, and calls for an open-minded discussion to understand the magnitude of this topic. Ranking member Garcia thanks the witnesses for their service and courage, and praises Representative Burchett's leadership in bringing attention to the issue.
The subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs is underway. The chair emphasizes the importance of transparency and the need for a bipartisan approach to address national security concerns. The lack of information and stigma surrounding UAPs has hindered reporting and investigation of these occurrences. The witnesses testifying today have firsthand experience with UAPs and will provide unique perspectives. The American public has a right to know and understand these phenomena, and government agencies must be more open in sharing information. Congressional involvement is necessary to ensure accountability and transparency.
During the subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs, witnesses testified about their firsthand experiences with UAPs. One witness, a former Navy pilot, described encounters with unknown objects in the airspace near Virginia Beach. These encounters became so frequent that aircrew would discuss the risk of UAPs before each flight. Another witness, a former intelligence officer, discussed his role in the UAP task force and his knowledge of a UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program. He emphasized the need for transparency and congressional oversight. A retired Navy commander also testified about an encounter with a Tic Tac-shaped object in 2004, describing its superior capabilities and the lack of investigation into the incident. The witnesses collectively called for increased transparency and accountability in understanding these phenomena.
Witnesses at the subcommittee hearing testified about their firsthand experiences with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and called for increased transparency and accountability. They highlighted the need for a reporting system that allows pilots to report UAP sightings without fear of professional repercussions. Currently, the military has implemented measures for reporting UAPs, but the commercial aviation sector has not adapted to these practices. Witnesses stressed that UAPs pose a potential threat to national security due to their superior technological capabilities. They emphasized the importance of centralized data collection and two-way communication between operators and authorities to better understand and respond to UAP encounters. Mr. Gresh also mentioned that he believes the government possesses UAPs based on interviews with witnesses and the provided locations to the Inspector General and intelligence committees. Overall, the witnesses emphasized the need for a system that encourages and facilitates civilian reporting of UAP encounters and highlighted the need for further investigation into these phenomena.
