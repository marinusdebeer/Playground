The subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) or UFOs featured participation from members across several states. New entities have been established to examine the phenomena, including AARO (All-domain Anomaly Resolution Officer) and NASSAU, carrying out independent research. These groups aim to shed light on the subject, focusing on data gathering from both military and civilian sectors. The hearing raised concern about the need for government transparency and due public accountability towards this issue. It was hinted that there was increasing global attention and interest in the subject of UAPs. There is demand for open disclosure from the Department of Defense, intelligence communities, and the defense industry on their involvement with UAPs. Witnesses, including military personnel, were thanked for sharing their experiences, helping to bring the issue to the public eye. The hearing also raised concerns about potential threats from UAPs, and called for a careful, data-driven approach to the issue.
The subcommittee hearing addressed the seriousness, transparency, and necessity of delivering appropriate solutions to the situation of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). The core of this discussion is National Security, acknowledging that UAPs pose a considerable safety threat. It also addresses faith and trust in government agencies which are at an all-time low due to partisanship and alternative facts. The director of National Intelligence has published reports on UAPs, and NASA has announced a study into unidentified anomalous phenomena. The magnitude of whistleblower reports and stories necessitate a careful investigation. There have been several obstacles in obtaining a complete picture, such as the stigma around reporting on UAP encounters, especially on the civilian side. To enhance oversight and public disclosure, broad public support is required. The speaker stresses the importance of openness and transparency, while also acknowledging concerns about revealing sensitive information on national security. There is a real threat to military or civilian aircraft, which needs further examination. While the all domain anomaly resolution office and NASA have stated they found no evidence of extraterrestrial life, questions remain that the public wants to address themselves. Emphasis is placed on encouraging more reporting on UAPs for safety measures, and whistleblowers should not feel intimidated. The hearing calls for continued bipartisan work, more awareness within the Department of Defense and Congress on UAPs, and a fair and open look at the evidence from witnesses. This hearing marks the beginning of serious and significant work on this issue.

Three witnesses provided their accounts during the subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). 

The first witness, a former F-18 foxtrot pilot, discussed repeated encounters with UAPs after radar system upgrades in their navy jets. The objects were initially assumed to be radar errors, but corroboratory information from onboard sensors and visual ID confirmed their presence. One incidence involved an object coming within 50 feet of an aircraft during a training session. Even though a safety report was filed, there was no official acknowledgment and no mechanism for further reporting sightings. The frequency of such encounters necessitated discussing the risk of UAP as part of regular pre-flight briefs. The witness then established Americans for Safe Aerospace, a safe haven for UAP witnesses previously silent due to a lack of a secure reporting process.

The second witness, an ex-intelligence officer for the U.S Air Force, served in many roles related to UAPs. His report to the UAP task force highlighted grave concerns regarding the U.S. government's handling of UAP information. He argued the heightened secrecy and lack of congressional oversight in this matter were problematic and urged Congress to investigate these claims thoroughly. His decision to become a whistleblower was premised on his data collection revealing a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program.

The third witness was a retired commander from the United States Navy. He explicitly narrated an encounter with a UAP during a training exercise off the coast of California. Despite initial confusion about the mission, they detected a Tic Tac object moving over the water erratically. As they got closer to the object, it rapidly accelerated in front of them and disappeared. This occurrence was also captured in a 90-second video which was not released publicly. The object deployed jamming activities against their radar system. There was no subsequent investigation after this incident, even though it was reported and after a few days, it became a story shared privately among friends.
During a further panel discussion on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), the question of preparedness in dealing with UAPs was discussed, underscoring the limited options available for reporting such encounters. Critical concerns were expressed about the aviation safety risk posed by UAPs, which is acknowledged by the military, but ignored in the commercial sector. The need for a secure reporting system, free from stigma or fear of professional repercussions was emphasized. The speakers also discussed the reasons why information about UAPs might not be fully available to the public, including potential national security vulnerabilities and unveiling weaknesses in defense systems. The panelists continued to elaborate and discuss the distinct UAP incidents they experienced and the responses to them. Concerns were raised about the absence of an official system for pilots to report UAP encounters and the subsequent ramifications on national security interests. It was concluded that creating a centralized repository for reporting such phenomena might be some form of resolution for both military and commercial pilots. The witnesses reiterated that the behaviors and maneuvers of the witnessed UAPs did not align with current understanding of technology and capabilities. One of the panelists stated that the U.S. government does have possession of UAPs, a claim based on interviews with numerous witnesses. The development of safe and transparent reporting processes for UAP encounters, particularly in the field of aviation, was highlighted as an urgent requirement.

In a panel discussion regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), the participants stressed the importance of a secure system for reporting encounters, calling attention to safety risks in aviation and potential national security issues. They voiced concern about the lack of an official reporting system and the apparent disregard of these issues in the commercial sector. The panelists also expressed the need for a centralized repository for UAP reports, citing the unusual behavior of these phenomena. One panelist claimed that the U.S. government is in possession of UAPs, based on multiple witness testimonies. The panel additionally discussed an incident at Vandenberg Air Force Base where a large, cube-like UAP was reported hovering over a launch facility for approximately 45 seconds before quickly departing.

During a follow-up discussion on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), aggressive behaviors from these UAPs were reported, approaching security guards at rapid speeds before disappearing. This information was corroborated with official documentation, and the object was described to be almost as large as a football field. Concerns were raised about commercial aviators who were reportedly receiving cease and desist orders from corporations to prevent sharing information about UAP-related safety issues. 

Discussion also centered around the objects' speed and g-forces, which were noted to be beyond human survivability based on known technology. The UAPs were described as spherical, perfectly white and smooth, without any apparent seams or windows. 

Talking about U.S. government involvement, it was hinted that there is certain knowledge of non-human origin craft and advanced technologies based on previous work, including potential abuse of funds allegedly misappropriated for specific programs. It was suggested that U.S corporations might be overcharging for certain tech and the additional funds could be going elsewhere. 

There were insinuations that satellite imagery of UAP related events and potentially crash sites is available but could not be openly discussed. References were made about a possible disinformation campaign to deny the fact of certain UAPs, and the contradiction posed by a statement denying evidence of extraterrestrial activity was highlighted. 

NASA's research role on commercial aviation safety and UAPs was discussed, with recommendations made to utilize NASA's aviation safety reporting system for UAP encounters. The possibility of using commercial capabilities like space-based or ground-based sensor systems was also considered. Moreover, the testimony touched upon the ongoing efforts from different organizations (NASA, Harvard University) to study UAP and how the growing empowerment of military pilots to share their UAP experiences might positively influence the scientific community's research goals.
During a hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), questions were raised regarding the level of security clearance needed to access UAP-related programs, potential disinformation campaigns by the U.S government, and the involvement of private corporations. It was suggested that hearings like this could help reduce the stigma surrounding the topic, stimulate interest, and generate solutions. Discussion revolved around the need for scientific and engineering expertise to address the UAP issue, raising the idea that it's not solely a national security problem. The interaction of defence contractors with UAP programs was also explored with no clear procedures identified for reporting UAP encounters. The essential nature of strengthening scientific and inter-agency collaboration in approaching this issue was emphasized. Moreover, the importance of establishing an official process for reporting UAP sightings, particularly by commercial pilots, was underlined. The discussion also included a review of specific UAP incidents, including the famous Phoenix Lights case in Arizona in 1997.
Congress and representatives questioned UAP witnesses about sightings, their implications, and procedures for encounters. The witnesses suggested enhancements in both Congress and the U.S. military's approaches to dealing with UAP sightings. Points of discussion included developing service-wide reporting systems, attaching sensor data to reports, reducing over-classification, and encouraging open reporting without career consequences. Witnesses also indicated that they believe the 2019 classification guidelines for unidentified aerial phenomena interfere with the federal government's transparency. It was noted that some of the UAP sightings predated existing advanced programs, hinting at unknown origin. Across two incidents, pilots experienced failures in their radar and FLIR systems close to UFOs, raising national security concerns due to the craft’s potential ability to disable advanced military technology. The importance of recognizing and acknowledging UAP encounters without stigma was emphasized. A suggestion was made to better utilize theoretical frameworks like the holographic principle to understand possible inter-dimensional attributes of UAPs. It was remarked that there is a need for extensive scientific and inter-agency collaboration to comprehensively address the UAP issue.
The text examines a hearing where Congress and representatives have questioned UAP witnesses about their experiences, the potential implications of those experiences, and their perspectives on both existing procedures for encounters with unexplained aerial phenomena and potential enhancements to these procedures. Some witnesses suggested that Congress and the military need to develop more effective reporting systems for UAP sightings, to attach sensor data to these reports, and to encourage open reporting without danger for those who come forward. Witnesses also raised concerns about over-classification and current classification guidelines (specifically those implemented in 2019) that they believe hinder the federal government's transparency. Some sightings reportedly predated the programs currently in existence, leading to speculation about possible unknown origins of these phenomena. Officials highlighted two cases in which pilots claimed to have experienced failures in their radar and FLIR systems during encounters with unidentified objects, raising concerns about the potential national security implications if these phenomena can disabled advanced military technology. One proposal put forward in the hearing was a more robust utilization of theoretical frameworks such as the holographic principle to potentially understand assumed inter-dimensional attributes of UAP. It was also underlined that the UAP issue requires scientific and inter-agency collaboration.

Several representatives posed critical questions: One suggesting meeting in a secure facility for more detailed answers, another expressing concern about national security after a Chinese spy balloon was shot down off the coast of their state and about a potential disinformation campaign in the government, and several asking about unreported sightings by pilots and any repercussions faced by those who report them. Witnesses Mr Graves and Mr Favor were queried on the potential number of UAP sighting going unreported (Mr Graves estimated it could be as high as 95%), the operating procedure after sightings, and their personal encounters with UAP, like the Tic Tac UAP, including whether the objects defied the laws of physics. There were also questions about whether these UAPs could really be classified weapons being tested by the government and if that was typical procedure. Furthermore, Mr Gresh was asked about the level of investigation into UAPs, whether officials have unlawfully withheld information from Congress, and whether the government is in possession of potentially nonterrestrial craft or has made contact with intelligent extraterrestrials. The latter questions raised the topic of government possession of crashed crafts and potential non-human biologics reportedly associated with such recoveries.
In the UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) inquiry by Congress, key witnesses suggested that more streamlined reporting systems and open platforms that ensure no retribution should be established, while questioning the hindrance by current classification guidelines. Two cases underlining the potential national security threats where pilots experienced technical failures during UAP encounters were highlighted. Theoretical frameworks such as the holographic principle were suggested for understanding inter-dimensional attributes of UAP, with the issue calling for scientific and inter-agency collaboration. Witnesses Mr Graves, Mr Gresh and Mr Favor were thoroughly questioned on unreported sightings, classified weapons testing, existing protocols for verified encounters, and potential possession of extraterrestrial crafts and biologics. 

In the subsequent Q&A session, members of Congress grilled the witnesses on the safety of personnel involved in reverse engineering programs, whistleblower complaints handling, the terminology used to describe these phenomena and possible foreign policy implications. The potential occurrence of white-collar crimes in possible cover-ups was also raised. Witnesses were also asked to share their experiences, attitudes, and conclusions from their encounters with these unexplained phenomena. Sharing their motivations for being part of the inquiry, the witnesses largely cited their sense of duty and desire to contribute to the reporting and understanding of UAPs. They expressed the need for more public avenues to report sightings and for witnesses to maintain factual accuracy while refraining from speculation. The session concluded with members of Congress acknowledging the importance and seriousness of the hearing and expressing gratitude to the witnesses for their courage and insights.

While wrapping up the UAP inquiry, members of Congress reflected positively on the bipartisan nature of discussions and expressed their commitment to continue investigations, stressing the importance of such hearings for national security and for providing information to the public. They emphasized the value of repeated questioning to ensure important points are officially recorded. Congress representatives acknowledged the role of the media in conducting independent investigations on UAPs and reporting on them. As educators, some committee members emphasized the importance of following facts and supporting science. The need for more transparency and public availability of information was highlighted. Finally, they thanked their office staff for their hard work and adjourned the hearing, granting members five days to submit additional materials or written questions for the witnesses to answer.
