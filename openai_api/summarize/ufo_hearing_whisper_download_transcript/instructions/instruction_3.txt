Please provide a detailed (keep as much detail as possible) summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
During the subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs, witnesses testified about their firsthand experiences with UAPs. One witness, a former Navy pilot, described encounters with unknown objects in the airspace near Virginia Beach. These encounters became so frequent that aircrew would discuss the risk of UAPs before each flight. Another witness, a former intelligence officer, discussed his role in the UAP task force and his knowledge of a UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program. He emphasized the need for transparency and congressional oversight. A retired Navy commander also testified about an encounter with a Tic Tac-shaped object in 2004, describing its superior capabilities and the lack of investigation into the incident. The witnesses collectively called for increased transparency and accountability in understanding these phenomena.

part of your organization do you feel adequately trained and briefed on how to handle encounters with uaps no right now uh military witnesses to UAP have limited options for reporting UAP but more more concerning is that commercial uh Aviation sector has not adapted to the lessons that the military has implemented um the military and Department of Defense has stated that UAP represent a critical Aviation safety risk we have not seen that that same that same language being used in the commercial markets they are not acknowledging this risk okay what steps do you think you have to be taken to improve a pilot's UAP reporting be it military or commercial right now we need a system where Pilots can report without fear of losing their jobs there is a fear that the stigma associated with this topic is going to lead to professional repercussions either through management or perhaps through their yearly physical check so having a secure system reducing the stigma and making this available this information available through the public is going to reduce the concerns that aircrew have could you just give me a little idea that the degree to which reports in the past are are not made public right now well I don't think there has been a proper reporting system to gather those reports and thus not report them so to answer your question I think there is a dearth of data due to the fact that the reporting has been limited up to this time could you tell me why you believe it's kind of play The Devil's Advocate a reason why some of this stuff should not be available to the public there's certainly some National Security concerns when we use our Advanced sensors and our tactical Jets to be able to identify these these objects however there's no reason that the objects themselves would be classified I would be curious to see how the security classification guideline actually spells out the different nuances of how this topic is classified from the from the perspective of UAP not National Security I'll give you a follow-up on that assuming that there are reasons why not all this should be made public this has been around for a long period of time um can you think of can any of the three of you think of any reason why anything related to uaps say 15 years and back should not be immediately made public one of it is uh acknowledging a vulnerability both from a collection and I'll just say A you know countermeasure perspective so it's uh no we haven't cracked for many years yeah even say 20 years back is there any reason why when you go back that far things shouldn't be made public unless it shows a specific National Security vulnerability as it relates to a weakness and particular defenses okay Mr fravor the Tic Tac incident that you and that with that you were engaged occurred in 2004 what kind of reporting took place after that incident a standard debrief where the back seaters went down to our carrier Intel Center and briefed what had happened and that was it no one else talked to us and I was in the top 20 in the battle group no one came that Captain was aware Admiral was aware nothing was done you're commanding officers provide any sort of justification no because I was a commanding officer of the Squadron so no was this incident the only UAP event that you encountered while you were a pilot yes it was okay um this is for any one of you based on based off of each of your experiences and observations do you believe uaps pose a Potential Threat to our national security yes and here's why the the technology that we faced was far superior than anything that we had and you could put that anywhere if you if you had one you captured one you reverse engineered it you got it to work you're talking something can go into space go someplace drop down in a matter of seconds do whatever it wants and leave and there's nothing we can do about it nothing okay either the other YouTube I would also like to add from commercial Aviation and Military Aviation perspective we deal with uncertainty in our operating space as a matter of of our protection professional actions identifying friend from foe is very important to us and so when we have unidentified targets and we continue to ignore those due to a stigma or a fear of what it could be that's an opening that our adversaries can take advantage of what what uh steps should we take in to better understand and respond to UAP Encounters in the interest of National Security there needs to be a location where this information is centralized for processing and there needs to be a two-way communication Loop so the operators on the front end have a feedback and can can get best practices on how to process information what to do and to ensure that they they their reporting is being listened to right now there's not a lot of back and forth Mr gresh in your complaint to the intelligence Community inspector you Inspector General you claim that you believe information is being hidden what kind of information do you think was hidden and do you think it should remain hidden very briefly an unclassified manner as you know the preponderance of my complaint was classified to the intelligence communities uh both material acquisition and exploitation activity also baselining the uaps but not sharing it with you know intelligence professionals that are actually doing step briefs to Pilots uh that that kind of information yeah okay thank you very much now we'll go to Mr Garcia thank you um again thank you all for for your service and for testifying today um I want to just uh talk about the uap's relates to what we're seeing in the Pilot's interaction with uaps particularly Mr Graves one of the I think concerns that for members of this committee is this idea that Pilots there's no system to actually report uaps and the stigma around pilots and so could you can you just briefly you mentioned that there are you working with 30 Pilots right now that have had encounters with uaps uh but you've also I believe I'm discussed and know of many more pilots this is just those that you're currently working with is that correct can you expand on that certainly I'll break that down in two ways first when we were first experiencing these objects off the Eastern Seaboard in the 2014 to 2015 time period anyone that had upgraded their radar systems were seeing these objects so there was a large number of my colleagues that were detecting these objects off the Eastern Seaboard they were further correlating that information with the other onboard centers and many of them also had their own on eyesightings as well of these objects now that was our personal first firsthand experience at the time since then as I've engaged this topic others have reached out to me they share their experiences both on the military side as well as a commercial Aviation side on the military Aviation side veterans that have recently got out have shared their stories and have expressed how the objects we were seeing in 2014 2015 continued all the way to 2019 2020 and Beyond and so it became a generational issue for Naval aviators on the Eastern Seaboard this was something we are briefing to new students this is something that was included in the notice to Airmen to ensure that there was no uh accidents and now with commercial aviators they are reaching out because they're having somewhat similar experiences as our military brothers and sisters but they do not have any reporting system that they can send this to and let me just add both to to Mr fravor as well as Mr Graves not having this system for for reporting would you degree that is harmful to not just our national security interests but to understand this phenomenon of what's happening with uaps I think it's it's uh it's a it's actually it's a travesty that we don't have a system to correlate this and actually investigate you know so if you took the East Coast you know there's there's Coastal Radars out there that monitor our air defense identification zone so out to 200 miles uh they can track these you know so when you see them they can actually go and pull that data and and get maneuvering and instead of just having the airplanes there's other data sources out there and I've talked to other government officials on this so you need a centrally located repository that these reports go to so if you just stuck it in dod you wouldn't get anything out of the intelligence committee because they have a tendency not to talk but if you had a central location where these reports would come in not just military but also commercial Aviation because there's a lot of that going on especially if you talk to anyone that flies from here to Hawaii over the Pacific they see odd lights so I think you need to develop something that allows you a central point to collect the data in order to investigate Mr Graves I will concur with everything Mr fraver said I'll continue to say that the commercial pilots that have reached out to me through Americans for safe Aerospace are doing so because they don't feel there's another way for them to report their safety issue and I think one of the clear outcomes of this hearing already is that there has to be a safe and transparent reporting process for Pilots both on the commercial side and the military side to be able to report uaps in a way that's also transparent but also understands the scope of our of our national security interests and what uh may be classified or not but I think there has to be some sort of system and so that's something that I hope can be an outcome that this committee can can work on uh is there anything else for just for the two of you briefly Beyond this reporting system that you think that we can do as a government to encourage and facilitate more civilian reporting I'm just doing it right now okay great I think this hearing is is going to show the American people that their government takes this topic seriously and how civilians that may not be Pilots what kind of process could be in place for civilians who are not pilots who may have UAP encounters do either of you have any suggestions that could facilitate that my recommendations would make would be to make that a sense a sensor Centric operation in order to make it as objective as possible okay sir Mr favor no I agree with Mr Graves on that okay um just just briefly I also just want to um note for particularly for the two pilots that have a question for Mr grush one of the things that I found fascinating in our discussion Mr Graves last night as well is that you've both described um uaps and formations and the way they have they they they are observed in space or or in our air and the way that they move essentially um ways in which current technology or aircraft that we know of are unable to actually function or move and so will you just for the public record again once once again um just uh briefly uh just either describe or note that aircraft are being witnessed particularly by the 30 folks that you're working with are essentially outside the scope of anything that we know of today in the technology we have today Mr graves Mr favor yes the objects that are being seen by commercial pilots are performing Maneuvers that are unexplainable due to our current understanding of our technology and our capabilities as a country and that applies for the military as well Mr yeah I concur with that we have nothing that can stop in midair and go the other direction nor do we have anything that can like in our situation come down from space hang out for three hours and go back up thank you my last question and so and sometimes you I know that some you have also said some of these answers in the past we're trying to get them on the public record as well which is really important Mr gresh finally do you believe that our government is in possession of uaps absolutely based on interviewing uh over 40 Witnesses over four years and and where I know the exact locations and those locations were provided to the Inspector General and some of which to the intelligence committees I actually had the people with the first-hand knowledge um provide a protected disclosure to the Inspector General thank you and Mr chairman I would just say that I think that these questions are important questions and I look forward to being involved in the process to get those answered I know there'll be a lot of questions from the committee members so I yield back thank you we'll go to Mr Richard himself thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Garcia I would like to have you on the my legislation to do just that on the on the reporting um and we'll get together on that
