Please provide a detailed (keep as much detail as possible) summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
The subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs is about to begin. The chair welcomes everyone and announces the members of the subcommittee who will be participating. The lack of transparency regarding UAPs has fueled speculation and eroded public trust. Congress has established entities to examine UAPs, but there are pressing demands for government transparency and accountability. The Biden Administration's handling of a Chinese spy balloon incident and the lack of clarity on UAP work from the Department of Defense are concerning. The subject of UAPs requires a careful data-driven approach, and today's hearing aims to provide clarity on improving reporting and government efficiency. Representative Burchett emphasizes that this is a nonpartisan issue and thanks his colleagues and the witnesses. He acknowledges the difficulties in organizing the hearing and expresses the need for government transparency and an end to the cover-up. Representative Luna highlights the captivation and belief of the American people in UAP sightings. She criticizes the lack of transparency and assurance for service members, and calls for an open-minded discussion to understand the magnitude of this topic. Ranking member Garcia thanks the witnesses for their service and courage, and praises Representative Burchett's leadership in bringing attention to the issue.

been working very hard to ensure uh that today's hearing is serious that it's transparent and that it also provides appropriate answers as our oversight body always demands now it's really important that we're here in a bipartisan way to have this conversation which really to the heart of it is about National Security and key to the subcommittee's Core purpose this is the subcommittee on National Security of the oversight committee now our witnesses will testify today that uaps have posed a serious safety threat and we must understand this more broadly we're dealing with real questions that get to the heart of our faith in government faith in our institutions as we all know is at an all-time low partisanship and alternative facts make it too easy to doubt narrative or into or our institutions but this hearing will offer the public unique perspectives building on years of reporting by both federal agencies and the Independent Media now some of the earliest reporting on this issue was a groundbreaking 2017 New York Times report which we which revealed research as we know now on unidentified anomalous phenomena as many call UFOs by the defense intelligence agency Mr Graves and Commander forever's experiences with uaps have also been documented by the public not just by the New York Times but CNN and many other national news outlets now the office of the Director of National Intelligence has published public reports doc committing uaps and on June 9th 2022 NASA announced that the agency is commissioning a study to of course examine unidentified anomalous phenomena now the sheer number of reports whistleblowers and stories of unidentified anomalous phenomena should raise real questions and warrant investigation and oversight and that's why we are here today now Pilots have reported encounters for years now because of the stigma around reporting these incidents we still don't have a complete picture of actually what's going on particularly as our witnesses will testify on the civilian side and that is a real problem that we have today in the country now it's very important that we show that Democrats and Republicans in Congress can come together in a bipartisan way to cut through misinformation and to look at the facts in a serious and thoughtful manner if we are to advance oversight and public disclosure we must also gain the broad support of the public we will succeed getting facts out to the public faster if there is a broad public support as part of the process now I understand fully the Department of Defense is hesitant to share information that could also undermine our national security by revealing information on the capabilities of our own aircraft our sensors and other sensitive material at the same time many people believe that we're withholding information from them and that is dangerous also I believe in openness and transparency that is also the role of Congress and I want to trust that the American people will be able to weigh the evidence and make up their own minds now we have incidents where in sensors sometimes even multiple types of sensors detect things that we cannot explain uaps whatever they may be May pose a serious threat to our military or civilian aircraft and that must be understood now my career in training as a long time and career educator and teacher and researcher tell me that we should never rule anything out we know that our space of course is vast and undiscovered I also want to note that Mr Sean Kirkpatrick director of the all domain anomaly resolution office the component of the dod office that investigates UAP data has testified before the Senate this year that his unit has found no evidence of extra extra activity NASA has also stated that they don't have evidence of extraterrestrial life either and we've heard this of course from some of our government agencies and we should remind viewers and Witnesses which I think is really important that we also cannot share classified information in public settings but questions of course remain that people want to see data and information for themselves the enormous interest in the hearing today underscores the importance of a fair and open look at the evidence from Witnesses who can share their unique perspectives now I know I certainly have a lot of questions I know that all the members of our committee do as well we should come to this hearing with an open mind and we should not let our existing ideas restrict us on either side I hear over and over from many agencies the stigma around reporting and investigating uaps prevents us from getting real answers we know that whistleblowers have reported harassment intimidation or stigma as well and this is not acceptable if people can't report incidents which would have National Security or safety implications then that also has serious consequences for us as ranking member of this subcommittee I know it's my I know my job would be completely impossible if whistleblowers or others feel intimidated to come before this committee we can't be afraid of asking questions and we can't be afraid of the truth I'm proud to say this that's a hearing builds upon bipartisan work by members of the House and Senate dating many years back which is sought to increase awareness within the Department of Defense and more and to mandate more of Congress of uaps we know the Senate is taking up an amendment to their defense authorization bill which will create a commission with broad declassification Authority and we can all should all agree that that is an important step members of both parties and Senior officials in multiple administrations have taken an interest in this issue and we're proud to carry and build that confidence in the American people this hearing will also not be the end of this discussion but a new chapter and start to years and years of work that many folks both in both in the public and within government have been working on we should encourage more reporting not less on uaps the more they under we understand the safer we will be we looked your testimony from Witnesses today with a long record of service to the American people and with subject matter expertise art Witnesses have a unique opportunity to share the prospective insights and their experiences with the American people and I encourage all of my colleagues to engage with these difficult questions with an open mind and to follow the facts on behalf of our country I also just want to say more broadly that we should look at this hearing with and believe that everything is on the table as it relates to uaps I think we an open mind is absolutely the best I want to yield there are two and a half minutes of the remainder of my time to the representative from Florida representative Moskowitz for an opening statement he also has been very much engaged in this issue and I want to thank him for his leadership Congressman uh thank you ranking member Garcia thank you Mr chairman I want to thank uh Tim burchett and Anna Paulina Luna for their leadership in pushing uh this hearing forward I want to thank obviously committee staff and their staff working on this on a bipartisan basis because many Americans are deeply interested uh in this issue and it shouldn't take the potential of non-human origin to bring us together uh additionally I want to thank the witnesses for for coming forward to share your perspectives your thoughts and the sightings of uaps unlike other hearings many times in Congress you're not here to help a political party but you're here to share information with the American people and it's not something that is just going on in this Administration it's something that's uh spanned many administrations for decades many Americans have been fascinated by objects mysterious and unexplained and it's long past time that they got some answers the American public has a right to learn about Technologies of unknown Origins non-human intelligence and unexplainable phenomena those are not the words of a UFO Twitter account though that is a direct quote for majority leader Chuck Schumer that the American public has a right to learn about Technologies of unknown Origins non-human intelligence and unexplainable phenomena in an interview with Fox News recent former Director of National Intelligence John Radcliffe confirmed the U.S government is aware a lot more sightings of uaps and that they have not made that information public I quote there are a lot more sightings that have not been made public Radcliffe said to Fox News for me this hearing is about transparency we unfortunately live in a time in which many people distrust government and our institutions and over classification of information away from the American public or even Congress contributes to today's Politics the American people have regular questions what are uaps how come the media doesn't report more on them are they foreign adversaries are the U.S technology are they something else they ask themselves how come when a Russian jet shoots flares at one of our drones we have perfect pictures and videos to show the American people and the world but when it comes to uaps nothing of course we must always protect our national security to maintain our superiority like when stealth helicopters were only rumored to exist but were used in the Osama Bin Laden raid in 2011. but we can't allow that to be used as a shield to keep the American people completely in the dark from basic truths the American people deserve to hear more about special access programs Congress has a right to know if there's any unsanctioned weapons development satellite imagery that has not been provided to Congress Congress created the all-domain resolution office in the ndaa of 2022. in its initial analysis there are 171 uncharacterized UAP reports and this is the words from the report that appear to have demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities I believe more information is known about the 171 instances it's time for Congress to reinsert ourselves I call on our military leaders and intelligence officials to release more information to the American people about uaps and to our military leaders if there's nothing to conceal let Congress go to write Patterson Air Force Base The dugway Proving Ground or even Groom Lake in Nevada we should have disclosure today we should have disclosure tomorrow the time has come thank you ranking member thank you Mr Moskowitz and I would yield back now to our chairman thank you right now I'd like to introduce our Witnesses our first Witnesses Lieutenant Ryan Graves he's the executive director of Americans for safe Aerospace Lieutenant Graves is also a former U.S Navy F-18 pilot with the Zone UAP experience the next witness David grush is a former senior intelligence officer with the National geospatial Intelligence

Graves for five minutes for your opening statement thank you chairman Rothman ranking member Garcia distinguished members of the House oversight subcommittee on National Security representative burchett and Luna my name is Ryan fobs Graves and I'm a former F-18 pilot with a decade of service in the U.S Navy including two deployments in operation enduring freedom and operation inherent resolve I have experienced Advanced UAP firsthand and I'm here to voice the concerns of more than 30 commercial air crew and military veterans who have confided their similar encounters with me today I would like to highlight three critical issues that demand our action as we convene here UAP are in our airspace but they are grossly under reported these sightings are not rare or isolated they are routine military aircrew and commercial pilots trained observers whose lives depend on accurate identification are frequently witnessing these phenomena the stigma attached to UAP is real and powerful and challenges National Security it silences commercial pilots who fear professional repercussions discourages Witnesses it is only compounded by recent government claims questioning the credibility of eyewitness testimony parts of our government are aware of more about UAP than they let on the excessive classification practices keep crucial information hidden since 2021 all UAP videos are classified as secret or above this level of secrecy not only impedes our understanding
