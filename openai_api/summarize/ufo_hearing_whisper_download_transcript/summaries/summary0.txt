The subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) or UFOs featured participation from members across several states. New entities have been established to examine the phenomena, including AARO (All-domain Anomaly Resolution Officer) and NASSAU, carrying out independent research. These groups aim to shed light on the subject, focusing on data gathering from both military and civilian sectors. The hearing raised concern about the need for government transparency and due public accountability towards this issue. It was hinted that there was increasing global attention and interest in the subject of UAPs. There is demand for open disclosure from the Department of Defense, intelligence communities, and the defense industry on their involvement with UAPs. Witnesses, including military personnel, were thanked for sharing their experiences, helping to bring the issue to the public eye. The hearing also raised concerns about potential threats from UAPs, and called for a careful, data-driven approach to the issue.
