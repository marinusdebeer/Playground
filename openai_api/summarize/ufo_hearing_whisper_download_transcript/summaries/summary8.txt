The witnesses mentioned government possession of UAPs based on witness interviews and locations, and called for further investigation into UAP encounters. They discussed sightings and aggressive behaviors by UAPs, as well as the lack of details on these objects. The witnesses stressed the lack of an official reporting process for pilots to report UAPs to the FAA and the need for data on the kinematics and origin/destination of UAPs. They also discussed the government's involvement in disinformation campaigns and the importance of transparency. Members of Congress asked about defense contractors and the requirements for notification to Congress. The witnesses agreed on the need for more transparency and the declassification of certain materials. They also discussed interdimensional travel, crashes of UAPs, the potential capabilities of UAPs to disable radar and collection systems on aircraft, and the lack of tools and support for pilots in reporting UAP experiences.
