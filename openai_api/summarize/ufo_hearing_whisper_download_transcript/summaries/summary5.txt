During a follow-up discussion on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), aggressive behaviors from these UAPs were reported, approaching security guards at rapid speeds before disappearing. This information was corroborated with official documentation, and the object was described to be almost as large as a football field. Concerns were raised about commercial aviators who were reportedly receiving cease and desist orders from corporations to prevent sharing information about UAP-related safety issues. 

Discussion also centered around the objects' speed and g-forces, which were noted to be beyond human survivability based on known technology. The UAPs were described as spherical, perfectly white and smooth, without any apparent seams or windows. 

Talking about U.S. government involvement, it was hinted that there is certain knowledge of non-human origin craft and advanced technologies based on previous work, including potential abuse of funds allegedly misappropriated for specific programs. It was suggested that U.S corporations might be overcharging for certain tech and the additional funds could be going elsewhere. 

There were insinuations that satellite imagery of UAP related events and potentially crash sites is available but could not be openly discussed. References were made about a possible disinformation campaign to deny the fact of certain UAPs, and the contradiction posed by a statement denying evidence of extraterrestrial activity was highlighted. 

NASA's research role on commercial aviation safety and UAPs was discussed, with recommendations made to utilize NASA's aviation safety reporting system for UAP encounters. The possibility of using commercial capabilities like space-based or ground-based sensor systems was also considered. Moreover, the testimony touched upon the ongoing efforts from different organizations (NASA, Harvard University) to study UAP and how the growing empowerment of military pilots to share their UAP experiences might positively influence the scientific community's research goals.
