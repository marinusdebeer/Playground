The witnesses highlighted the potential threat to national security posed by UAPs and stressed the importance of centralized data collection and communication. One witness mentioned government possession of UAPs based on witness interviews and location information. The witnesses emphasized the need for a system that encourages civilian reporting and further investigation into UAP encounters. Another witness spoke about reports of sightings and aggressive behaviors by UAPs, as well as the lack of seam or rivet details on the objects. There was also discussion about the government's involvement in disinformation campaigns and the need for transparency and accountability. Additionally, the NASA independent study team's research on UAPs was mentioned and its potential influence on the commercial and scientific communities.
