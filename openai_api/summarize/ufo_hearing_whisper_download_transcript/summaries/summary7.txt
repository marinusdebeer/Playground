Congress and representatives questioned UAP witnesses about sightings, their implications, and procedures for encounters. The witnesses suggested enhancements in both Congress and the U.S. military's approaches to dealing with UAP sightings. Points of discussion included developing service-wide reporting systems, attaching sensor data to reports, reducing over-classification, and encouraging open reporting without career consequences. Witnesses also indicated that they believe the 2019 classification guidelines for unidentified aerial phenomena interfere with the federal government's transparency. It was noted that some of the UAP sightings predated existing advanced programs, hinting at unknown origin. Across two incidents, pilots experienced failures in their radar and FLIR systems close to UFOs, raising national security concerns due to the craftâ€™s potential ability to disable advanced military technology. The importance of recognizing and acknowledging UAP encounters without stigma was emphasized. A suggestion was made to better utilize theoretical frameworks like the holographic principle to understand possible inter-dimensional attributes of UAPs. It was remarked that there is a need for extensive scientific and inter-agency collaboration to comprehensively address the UAP issue.
