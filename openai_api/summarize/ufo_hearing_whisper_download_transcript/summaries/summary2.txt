Three witnesses provided their accounts during the subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). 

The first witness, a former F-18 foxtrot pilot, discussed repeated encounters with UAPs after radar system upgrades in their navy jets. The objects were initially assumed to be radar errors, but corroboratory information from onboard sensors and visual ID confirmed their presence. One incidence involved an object coming within 50 feet of an aircraft during a training session. Even though a safety report was filed, there was no official acknowledgment and no mechanism for further reporting sightings. The frequency of such encounters necessitated discussing the risk of UAP as part of regular pre-flight briefs. The witness then established Americans for Safe Aerospace, a safe haven for UAP witnesses previously silent due to a lack of a secure reporting process.

The second witness, an ex-intelligence officer for the U.S Air Force, served in many roles related to UAPs. His report to the UAP task force highlighted grave concerns regarding the U.S. government's handling of UAP information. He argued the heightened secrecy and lack of congressional oversight in this matter were problematic and urged Congress to investigate these claims thoroughly. His decision to become a whistleblower was premised on his data collection revealing a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program.

The third witness was a retired commander from the United States Navy. He explicitly narrated an encounter with a UAP during a training exercise off the coast of California. Despite initial confusion about the mission, they detected a Tic Tac object moving over the water erratically. As they got closer to the object, it rapidly accelerated in front of them and disappeared. This occurrence was also captured in a 90-second video which was not released publicly. The object deployed jamming activities against their radar system. There was no subsequent investigation after this incident, even though it was reported and after a few days, it became a story shared privately among friends.
