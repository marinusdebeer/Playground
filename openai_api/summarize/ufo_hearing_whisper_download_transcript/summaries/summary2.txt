During the subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs, witnesses testified about their firsthand experiences with UAPs. One witness, a former Navy pilot, described encounters with unknown objects in the airspace near Virginia Beach. These encounters became so frequent that aircrew would discuss the risk of UAPs before each flight. Another witness, a former intelligence officer, discussed his role in the UAP task force and his knowledge of a UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program. He emphasized the need for transparency and congressional oversight. A retired Navy commander also testified about an encounter with a Tic Tac-shaped object in 2004, describing its superior capabilities and the lack of investigation into the incident. The witnesses collectively called for increased transparency and accountability in understanding these phenomena.
