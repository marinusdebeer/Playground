The subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs is underway. The chair emphasizes the importance of transparency and the need for a bipartisan approach to address national security concerns. The lack of information and stigma surrounding UAPs has hindered reporting and investigation of these occurrences. The witnesses testifying today have firsthand experience with UAPs and will provide unique perspectives. The American public has a right to know and understand these phenomena, and government agencies must be more open in sharing information. Congressional involvement is necessary to ensure accountability and transparency.
