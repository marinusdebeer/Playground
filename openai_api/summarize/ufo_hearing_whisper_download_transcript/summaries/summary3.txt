During a further panel discussion on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), the question of preparedness in dealing with UAPs was discussed, underscoring the limited options available for reporting such encounters. Critical concerns were expressed about the aviation safety risk posed by UAPs, which is acknowledged by the military, but ignored in the commercial sector. The need for a secure reporting system, free from stigma or fear of professional repercussions was emphasized. The speakers also discussed the reasons why information about UAPs might not be fully available to the public, including potential national security vulnerabilities and unveiling weaknesses in defense systems. The panelists continued to elaborate and discuss the distinct UAP incidents they experienced and the responses to them. Concerns were raised about the absence of an official system for pilots to report UAP encounters and the subsequent ramifications on national security interests. It was concluded that creating a centralized repository for reporting such phenomena might be some form of resolution for both military and commercial pilots. The witnesses reiterated that the behaviors and maneuvers of the witnessed UAPs did not align with current understanding of technology and capabilities. One of the panelists stated that the U.S. government does have possession of UAPs, a claim based on interviews with numerous witnesses. The development of safe and transparent reporting processes for UAP encounters, particularly in the field of aviation, was highlighted as an urgent requirement.
