Witnesses at the subcommittee hearing testified about their firsthand experiences with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and called for increased transparency and accountability. They highlighted the need for a reporting system that allows pilots to report UAP sightings without fear of professional repercussions. Currently, the military has implemented measures for reporting UAPs, but the commercial aviation sector has not adapted to these practices. Witnesses stressed that UAPs pose a potential threat to national security due to their superior technological capabilities. They emphasized the importance of centralized data collection and two-way communication between operators and authorities to better understand and respond to UAP encounters. Mr. Gresh also mentioned that he believes the government possesses UAPs based on interviews with witnesses and the provided locations to the Inspector General and intelligence committees. Overall, the witnesses emphasized the need for a system that encourages and facilitates civilian reporting of UAP encounters and highlighted the need for further investigation into these phenomena.
