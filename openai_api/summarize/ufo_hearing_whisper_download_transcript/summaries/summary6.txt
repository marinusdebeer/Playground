During a hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), questions were raised regarding the level of security clearance needed to access UAP-related programs, potential disinformation campaigns by the U.S government, and the involvement of private corporations. It was suggested that hearings like this could help reduce the stigma surrounding the topic, stimulate interest, and generate solutions. Discussion revolved around the need for scientific and engineering expertise to address the UAP issue, raising the idea that it's not solely a national security problem. The interaction of defence contractors with UAP programs was also explored with no clear procedures identified for reporting UAP encounters. The essential nature of strengthening scientific and inter-agency collaboration in approaching this issue was emphasized. Moreover, the importance of establishing an official process for reporting UAP sightings, particularly by commercial pilots, was underlined. The discussion also included a review of specific UAP incidents, including the famous Phoenix Lights case in Arizona in 1997.
