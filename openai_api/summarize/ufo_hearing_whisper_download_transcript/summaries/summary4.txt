In a panel discussion regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), the participants stressed the importance of a secure system for reporting encounters, calling attention to safety risks in aviation and potential national security issues. They voiced concern about the lack of an official reporting system and the apparent disregard of these issues in the commercial sector. The panelists also expressed the need for a centralized repository for UAP reports, citing the unusual behavior of these phenomena. One panelist claimed that the U.S. government is in possession of UAPs, based on multiple witness testimonies. The panel additionally discussed an incident at Vandenberg Air Force Base where a large, cube-like UAP was reported hovering over a launch facility for approximately 45 seconds before quickly departing.
