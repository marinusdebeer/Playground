The article discusses the high-level architecture of Twitter, emphasizing the importance of considering the scale of the platform, user interactions, and the volume of data read and written daily. Twitter is primarily a read-heavy system, with users consuming more content than they create. Key features to consider when designing Twitter's architecture include following other users, creating tweets, and viewing a news feed. The design should also account for the storage of media, the size of each tweet, and the number of active users. The architecture includes a client, application servers, a caching layer, a database (either relational or NoSQL), and a content delivery network for distributing static assets. The design should demonstrate an understanding of the trade-offs and the ability to weigh the pros and cons of different approaches.
