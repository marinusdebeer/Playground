well I can certainly assure you that we
are about to die hello again there
friends and fans Raptor here and Welcome
to our revisit of ravenbound the game
out now on Steam that's also having a
free DLC available during the Steam
summer sale which ends on July 13th the
game's also having a 20 discount so you
can get this one and the free DLC today
with the link Down Below in the
description if you want to grab it for
yourself and of course today's episode
is sponsored by the makers of Raven
bound so thanks to them for sponsoring
if you're a big fan of games like
valheim for example this has all that
awesome Scandinavian folklore that we've
enjoyed many a time in many different
games on this channel but this one doing
it in the format of a roguelite
adventure game a little bit of an RPG
where of course cards and things that we
get between each battle or rather each
life is going to help us with each run
so our life is kind of intended to be
limited here we're not supposed to be
very strong but really we're playing
like a raven that can take these here of
different characters that are kind of
just randomly generated but what's most
important is the cards that you bring
with you from Battle to battle or rather
just like run to run whoa that was a big
old jump there nice so anyway I'm going
around Gathering coins and whatnot and
we're in the kind of tutorial area where
it's just teaching us how to play the
game again and I thought it a good
opportunity to show off the very opening
of the game where we can fly around as
the Raven too so let's go ahead and
finish up this uh trial or challenge in
order to then leave the tutorial area
and go to the open world this game is an
open world you know RPG Survival action
combat game with a lot of different
elements to you know blocking and uh
dodging and pairing there's a lot of
timing to this one and it is a very very
very very challenging game I got
absolutely clobbered the first time but
I did like the open world elements and
the world design which is really
breathtaking at the start and all the
trees and whatnot are very nice too and
the rocks and all the different temples
and things that you can encounter and
enemies too are quite fun until they
kill you in about one second all right
let's go ahead and jump out of here and
see what we can do we'll go up to the
top of the tower so as I mentioned your
strategy is based on the cards that you
unlock and play and you can travel
across the whole world as a raven so
there's immediately fast travel unlocked
in the form of kind of a mount except
you become the mount which is pretty
cool too uh here's a few enemies here
that are going to teach us some more of
the basics uh Elites here are some of
the enemies that will have to fight
towards later parts of the game now of
course I'm blocking a little too early
so but yeah if you're a big fan of games
like for example the most recent Star
Wars game
of well Fallen order or Survivor or any
sort of game like valheim it's kind of a
combination of both of them with a lot
of combat that yeah heavily relies on
your timing now these guys are going to
be nice to us you know we can just pick
damage all day and we'll take like one
or two hit points since it's just a
tutorial area but we can regain health
of course by blocking and then doing
damage to the enemy we've got a lot of
different moves and right now I've
chosen for this character a um
a little bit more health and we could
also get a little uh
yeah nice little
you saw their grappling hook yeah so we
can pull ourselves out of battle in
order to line the enemies up perfectly
for like for example a like a perfectly
timed block I'm still practicing but
there we go I'm learning as I go on so
yeah the problems in this game that
you'll have to overcome of course are a
large number of enemies like how are you
going to deal with crowd control and
cards of course could be the solution
for that and or your strategy as you
play more of course there's other things
to find to chests and other drops and
enemies that will of course drop
fragments to that and there's lore
there's tons of lore with ruins all
around that have that runic writing on
them uh you know you might recognize it
from all the Viking games ever that of
course tell a story of what's going on
here behind the scenes
all right well let's go ahead and
collect all the fragments then
and we'll be out of here
and have one more around here
and there we go perfect
becoming a vessel
all right yeah so is as we die we of
course exit this Mortal coil and then uh
basically
can pick our run again
by customizing with these cards so uh
from the three fragments we just got we
can now pick different cards to apply to
our character over on the left side you
can see my equipment at the top which is
our sword and shield and below that is
our our tunic or like our armor and then
traits are below that as well we've got
a lot of things to unlock such as these
Relic cards so that's pretty cool so we
can increase stagger impact weapon
damage and or critical hits by 30 and
have a chance to increase bleeding
overall I think I'll choose the uh
or bone needle so that way we can
increase that by 60 which is a pretty
damn big jump for sure so uh before each
jump we can also customize our
characters and that of course includes
our weapons class and traits so it's not
just in the battle that we can modify
these things but also afterwards as we
die in between and we'll have to get our
hatred level up and uh luck and guard
critical chance and critical damage as
you see down below at the bottom so we
don't have enough of Mana in order to
equip this so that'll be our next goal
is to try to go and find some of that in
the open world area now the DLC that's
out for free remember is out until the
13th and it's known as hammers of a
vault and there are other DLCs and uh
pretty good Community out there too for
oh look at this secret area
oh yeah there we go that's what I wanted
to do yeah the community is giving a lot
of feedback to the devs too in fact
right on the uh Opening screen there uh
they do and I think even when you pause
they ask for feedback on what you like
what you don't like what you think
should be changed and to me that's
always a great sign of a good
development team when they're not not
only just open to feedback but literally
just being like hey press this button
and let us know uh what what you might
be thinking right now as you play
let's go
nice I'm thinking I need more gold
there we go
so cracking open pots is a good way to
find that of course I'm a little bit of
a loot Goblin in these types of games
but I certainly want to break everything
open
and see what I can do to find more stuff
there's also the ability I didn't show
it in our last battle there but of
course to lock onto enemies and that
does make the combat a little bit more
fluid too going from enemy a b and c oh
I don't want to fall down there do I
the grappling hook was a cool touch
rather than a double jump we get to jump
even further than that and it's in
combination with the raven that we get
to play as well
and of course the interesting story that
you saw right at the beginning
yeah character design looking pretty
damn nice now I think based on our armor
I think our character's appearance will
change too so when I first went in I
don't think I had this helmet and or
this tunic
so as we gather more armor we can switch
that out and our parent our appearance
will change and it'll be the same when
we pick a new vessel because we're gonna
die we are going to die I'm not I'm not
going to live very long in this game and
that's the point we're supposed to then
grind our way up and go through many
different changes as a player and as a
character in order to unlock better
abilities there we go class oh yeah oh
okay okay there we go Quest complete we
are now bird congratulations all right
so they want us to go to some of these
other locations this is the world map as
it is
and they want us to go explore and start
on our quests and side quests and mini
quests really all the quests are open
this is you know completely open as to
where we can fly and go fight in but as
you see there there's side quests and
Main quests in blue side quest in green
we can also or speed up and slow down
and uh yeah so we can go to this
secondary Quest down here and see what
it'll offer us
very nice by the way that the Fast
Travel is just us actually flying around
because there is quite a lot of
beautiful landscape to look at and if
you're a big fan of Skyrim or whatnot
the mountains are just very nice to look
at as you make your way around of course
lots of little landmarks battles and
other hidden things around that we'll
have to discover and explore as we play
Let's go ahead and zoom in here
literally zoom in
completing a side quest will reward us
with 100 coins
pounding out this area looks like an
enemy camp of some sort hmm
all right let's uh take a peek and see
what what it's got in store for us
visit the village of volkis till the
hall
Raven's eye
ah this gives us a tactical view of
Who's Who and
what's what
it's transform let's get a little closer
hi guys that's pretty cool you thought I
was a bird didn't you I got you hey
how's it going
all right
so it looks like
some enemies attacked a Healer and they
want us to go get a little bit of
Revenge and or make the area safe again
thieves without Hearts okay
well certainly looks nice
buildings under construction
lots of wood being stored granaries and
guard towers Palisades quite nice for
what seems to be an ordinary Village and
a sigilant lock
only be opened with the sigil key
oh
and now we get a new reward
hatred level reached your weapons and
armor affected by either armor erosion
or blunted Edge are restored oh so
there's a little bit of durability
vendors prices affected by
Trader restored
hatred level reduced by one down to a
minimum of zero oh I guess we want that
to be low
well I guess I will go with the
equipment restored but we I think get to
choose that at any time we're collecting
the car we're not necessarily using the
card so there's two cards we can play
here as they mentioned before we'll need
to get our Mana up for something like
this but this one will be free at zero
we've only got one Mana now you see that
in the upper right corner looks like we
have a key and 20 gold up there in the
upper right corner
so we can't just turn into a bird
everywhere we have to go to these little
beacons so that way it kind of balances
that out a little bit between uh having
forced fights that of course you can go
into and then also you know kind of a
fast traveler a faster travel I did
notice that there was a vendor here
though I do want to actually take a look
at what that might be
and what they might want to trade
oh sorry to cut in line sir hello
ah we could unlock a relic slot for 50.
very nice
well I don't have the coin for that but
we can come back hi there how you doing
okay let's go ahead and do this Mission
then so uh green should indicate where
we have to go so down that away let's uh
just proceed on foot I love the design
of the little village buildings
oftentimes I I'm getting very impressed
with how buildings are looking in game I
know it's completely off topic but
honestly it adds to the immersion fully
how wonderfully beautiful Villages look
and how they're well laid out having
some sort of a design as if it were a
survival city Builder things like a
hunter Granary main hall Brewery that
type of thing it's nice to see in these
games and I want some of these buildings
to be like 3D print I want to collect
these buildings and before we took our
very first look at this game the
developers were kind enough to send over
a little uh like a press pack with a lot
of little goodies inside things like a
like a mug and um
some I think a letter opener that was a
sword and some other in-game art and uh
looks like there's a lot of care to both
the design of the items that your
character will use and then just the
random things that your character can
get when they're being made oh hi there
when they're randomly created oh wow all
right looks like they're having no
problem taking care of some of these
guys
bodies right outside the village all
right let's go
so pretty peaceful so far
okay let the fun begin I see
oh wow
nice oh damn Spider-Man hi what you guys
gonna do about that
rambling Hook is underrated
oh okay
oh I'm bleeding now oh
whoa
whoa nice
let's try Dodge
that worked pretty good
nice because my cam now
oh we got some booty over here what do
we got open a hatred chest
numerous lost Mana or chains of
for a moment I read in before mint yes
get give me that one the one with the
beef I can't pick it though so let's go
with the Lost Mana damn I wanted the
beef
cool now we got a lot of cool cards now
again remember whenever we die we get to
uh kind of create a new character with
those
so collecting all this is pretty nice
for future builds and or that we could
use now
okay so the camp is ours oh and that is
what they need back at the other camp
a box of herbs and oils
Raven towers around oh lots of ravens
indeed
well let's go back down this way
or we could turn in our Quest okay I was
just looking to see if there was more
loot
don't see any other boxes so let's go
ahead and turn this one in so yeah
remember we can't turn into a bird until
we go to those
transmogification type dealies you know
the thing where we can just turn into a
bird fly and land anywhere we can land
anywhere and turn back into a human but
when it comes to Flying we got to go to
those things specifically
all right
let's go back to turn in this Quest
feels good man
whoa hi how much for that where'd you
get that helmet I want that
or is that literally a deer head
hold on I want that
are you an actual deer person I have no
I have no idea but I want that
all right
oh yeah wait this is like a deer Village
are deer villagers they're so near and
dear to our heart
all right well all done
job done money received oh 100 coin
now may I have
A Relic slot please thank you
and let's go ahead and take a look here
got Mana
game three Mana let's do that
and then we should be able to use our
ore bone needle which increases weapon
damage by 60.
nice
although I still feel like our weapon's
a little light now we can do even more
damage
so right these bird symbols like what we
saw earlier we just fly back but it was
a short distance
let's go somewhere else now
well let's go do a main quest thing
shall we
which is over this way
bird looks cool
I don't know if there's customization
options for the burb but uh
would be nice
another opportunity to just change the
colors and whatnot doesn't exist I
wouldn't be surprised if the community
gives feedback
oh boy
well down there is probably where I'm
gonna die I remember this place before
the side quest behind us though we might
have more of a chance to survive
so let's see what happens
again
surprise ah did you guys miss me
I bet you did
Luke goblets
that one's a bigger loot Goblin than me
oh
I hit the pillar did it make it mad
Hamp conquered oh okay these enemies
were much easier than I remember
all right cleansed chest
they have a light emitting from them and
we can uh
grab some items out of them
find an open
chest
we can't carry any more fragments
we walk out of here now
hope we're not leaving anything behind
all right so there's a few around us
ooh pretty flowers
we gotta go to each of the blue dots but
they're all within about 500 meters of
where we are now
any enemies oh hi
good
Batman
wow
oh sad I can't carry any more fragments
well let's go ahead and gain more Mana
take a look at our codex we got
tutorials for all sorts of things and
also lore
that's nice anytime we read one of those
discs that are in the game with the
runes I mentioned earlier we can come
back
to the Codex
and get additional information
well that's what we're looking for
item acquired
oh
somewhere in the current region a golden
pot filled with 200 coins will appear
nice draw three cards from your deck and
choose one to add to your hand
gotta go with that loot Goblin
give me that one
all right let's go to the next one maybe
over here
this one's only 200 away
oh man beautiful
flowers
weeds bushes
lots of layering of vegetation on top of
each other looks good
I love the surprise combat
I'm really a jerk you know they're
hanging out chilling maybe having a
barbecue and here I come with the whole
like hey I'm gonna kill your friends
stagger you
do a bunch of damage
oh there's your chest
Don't Mind If I Do
once you regain your lost Health to Mana
or unlock one Relic slot I would like
that please
okay
on to another camp
so I suppose this is a part of our
character building where we're gaining a
little bit of experience for ourselves
in pretty simple combat in the opening
area so we understand how to play a
little bit more outside the tutorial
additionally we're building our
characters characters more than one
meaning that we of course have access to
more cards when we die and or when we
explore the world
we'll learn a little bit more about
where things are which types of combat
missions or quests are a little more
challenging challenging and then if we
want to do those on each specific run
we can do that too so maybe one run we
want to go and try to find a bunch of
gold and do missions that give us the
most amount of gold and then spend that
gold on shops do a money run or go for
bosses and try to gain the most amount
of progress defeating them
by getting very powerful weapons and
equipment
oh man this is cool
all right top of the mountain we go
pretty round Tower
I want to sneak in through the window
oh well per usual here I come
just asserting my dominance as I come in
thank you
wow that was great there was blood
everywhere on that one
it's like playing Mortal Kombat or
something geez actually getting real
focused on the combat here and enjoying
it a bit
numerous lost Mana
really wish I could carry some more
fragments
choose a reward oh we got better armor
oh better weapon too no
when taking damage from
uh tooth tier increased by 100 percent
let me go with that
there we go perfect better armor
hatred gained from empowering fragments
will fill the bars in the lower right
corner
now I can grab more fragments
I think that was the right time to do
that
and those are pretty easy to acquire by
each enemy
another sigil key
more info coming in about the hatred
certainly a few game mechanics that I
think are easy to learn and
easy to keep track of nothing that's too
complicated aside from
blocking pairing and then building your
character
it looks like we're all done here
and we're free to move about the cabin
then we'll head down here now
to our next Quest we have to empower
fragments two more times and find one
more box I believe
I wonder if there's fall damage let's
try
I'm assuming there is and it's probably
quite generous with how much damage
he'll take
again asserting dominance when we rock
in the into place there we go nice
[Music]
wow
more fragments for me
all right worn twin swords
worn arms worn great acts ooh
let's go with the Warren Great ax
going from 31 to 47.
and then we should be able to repair
that
I believe
I'd like to hope that did some sort of a
benefit it was a good time to use it oh
and look at that our armor actually has
changed badass
oh we look absolutely badass
and that's a bad ax too
that's really cool
no more Shield or rather we have a
shield but not in the traditional sense
of made of wood
sharp and blade increases weapon damage
of currently equipped Weapon by 10
percent
get some coins or increase armor
currently equipped armor by three
I want 10 more damage and I want it now
all right so now are we heading
I can see a small Beacon down there
we'll go fly around we just need to get
into more fights to do this some of the
fragments I left behind we could go back
for but we can always get some new ones
there we go there's a bird Shrine over
there we should be able to fast travel
what who is this
are you guys Elites hi there
oh
[Music]
the combat has finally got much more
fast paced
oh nice our weapon is a lot slower too
so a different gameplay style to get
used to compared to the sword and shield
there's a noticeable difference and
that's cool that it's not just a kind of
a visually different weapon but it does
feel a lot different too that's really
nice
draw a new copy of a card you have
already played in this run that is not
foresight
let's go with that one
two more Mana
foreign
and even more Mana for us cool
it was good to clear out the map a
little bit with all these things
we'll need the sigil key to continue to
clear those
but
time to be light as a feather
make another tough enemy group here
well hello oh juggernaut
all right
foreign
charge up time yeah wow lawn mowered
uh that is a very good weapon for uh
dealing with attacks from behind because
as we're dealing with one enemy the
weapon of course will go 360.
Health increased by 30 percent
drauger deterring armor
we can lower their attack ability there
I think I'm gonna go with the bone
needle again and increase weapon damage
by another 60 percent
now we're doing 120 more damage I
believe
chains have been beefalment again
sometimes good things sometimes bad
things
all right make your way to the tomb of
gales
I'm kicking butt oh
hold on what is that I wanna
there was a symbol there for something
big and bad
all right the tomb of gales is right up
here
across a river and go up top
now it does seem like there's cards that
will restore our health
but it's a little more Rando as we go on
this run further things are getting a
little bit more challenging for us
hi there
bro you a kitty sweet
thanks Kitty
I think where we can fly is easily
marked by those birds on the uh
on the map too
in the world
[Music]
nice
the tomb has opened
open sesame
sesame seed chicken
oh
a big oh nice oh oh a big boss battle
foreign
oh damn
calm down bro
getting lawnmowered
of course dodging at the last second
giving us a little bit of a boost to our
frenzy which will do Big O damage
but dodging like that is exactly what we
want to do man he's like on roller
skates
that purple stuff is good
laughs
oh that's not good though
oh my God it's like fighting the damn
Pyramid Head from
on the hill too
chill bro
I was trying to get real close to him to
try to get him to trigger his attack oh
man we're about halfway on that one a
little bit but the vessel has fallen we
died as I predicted but that is one of
the hatred bosses cool we killed 22
Elites did 770 damage to the boss and uh
all I feel like we could have taken him
on if I had to continue to build up my
bigo
power is there of course to uh double
our damage in frenzy mode
but regardless what's most important
here is that we've unlocked cards that
we get to use again so even though we
did and pretty good our first run we're
gonna do even better each time and
that's what makes this a roguelike this
is what the gameplay Loop is like and
this is what's satisfying to be able to
like be like oh man I died I got to do
all that again but because we're
rewarded well now we get to go in as a
different character with a different
build find different cards there's a lot
of RNG you know random number generation
which will give us different perks and
different uh cards to be unlocked
through these boxes and or you know
fragments from killing enemies too
so a big old skill tree in this one that
goes uh all the way from
top to bottom of this raven here giving
us different things like for example uh
blood fueled all the way down to like uh
death of a Thousand Cuts which is just a
permanent reduced base damage but
multi-strike increased by 30. so we can
build things that way too so we get
better bigger and stronger every time
that we play and I I like that I like
I'm I'm really starting to like
roguelites a lot more for that purpose
and then we can of course go back and
see all the cars that we've unlocked
or learn more about the ones that we
possibly haven't that they'll unlock at
other levels so we can kind of get
prepared to see what our rewards will be
when we get to for example level 13. now
our protect guard inflicts Frozen on
attacker that kind of thing so not bad
159 out of 213 cards unlocked so and of
course the DLC will enter add a lot more
go ahead and enter another Vault there's
also Daily challenges we'll get bonuses
for that too so there's obviously
reasons to play day after day let's go
ahead and uh
not enter the the menu screen but the
enter a vault
there we go and so now we just get a
random human doesn't necessarily matter
these are just Champions that will kind
of take control of his a vessel but
really what matters is the fact that we
get different armor and the things that
we get to bring along with us this kind
of uh character has a hammer specialist
first time we had a sword and a shield
from our tutorial area now we get
something with a little bit more
defensive armor Hammer specialist and a
human who whenever they drain a card
gets 50 coins so yeah different each
time for their folk weapon class and
unique trait and then of course we add
more to that too which is pretty sweet
now if you don't like that if you're if
you're not feeling that character you
can always hold right to re-roll which I
just did I don't think it costs anything
but it's totally fine to just kind of
keep re-rolling if you want to or change
some of your stats that way through
weapon class
it looks like a pair of dice down there
so it feels like it's re-rolling but
looks like it's kind of just re-rolling
their appearance and their specialty a
little bit maybe
really cool to see an actual Archer I
don't know if there's a range class but
there could be weapons like that maybe a
javelin that we get to throw to
that must be what our character was
before generalists but I wouldn't mind
making it Hammer Time
yeah I think that would be just fine oh
cool you can actually oh left to
randomize your character too
so if you're not uh happy with their
hairstyle or something well you have to
change the whole character but
you know you could go from being the big
old bigger the brownie guy to uh
various characters of different age
[Music]
and a few different colors of their
clothing although generally the same
because it'll be based on the armor not
bad not bad at all you know I truly
enjoyed the time I had here today with
Raven bound and if you want to check it
out for yourself again check down below
in the description where you can get
ravenbaum for 20 off during the Steam
summer sale until July 13th and the
Hammers of a vault DLC is also free
during the summer sale of course this
action roguelite with open world freedom
is not going to be the only time we see
it here today I think I also want to do
another video on this to continue to
explore the cards that we've unlocked
and also do some live streams just for
fun in the future because this is
certainly the type of game that feels
like it's very easy to pick up play for
a little while either you can
continuously play on and on and on or
just do so in short little runs which is
fun yeah the vast island of a vault very
very fun I like it flying around as a
raven adapt your strategy based on the
cards you unlock and play and kind of
customize your characters each time you
do so all right everybody well that is
it for now thank you very much for
watching and I'll see you all
next time goodbye
