The author of the review is enjoying playing Ravenbound, a roguelite adventure game with RPG elements set in a Scandinavian folklore-inspired world. They mention that dying and starting over is satisfying because each time they can play as a different character with a different build and find new cards through RNG. They also mention the presence of a skill tree that allows them to customize their character and get stronger with each playthrough. The author likes the variety of cards and the ability to unlock more as they progress. They mention the free DLC and the active community. The graphics and design of the game are praised, as well as the ability to transform into a bird for fast travel and the presence of vendors. The author plans to continue playing and explore the cards they have unlocked.
