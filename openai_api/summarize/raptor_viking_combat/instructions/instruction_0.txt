Please provide a detailed summary of the following: 
well I can certainly assure you that we are about to die hello again there friends and fans Raptor here and Welcome to our revisit of ravenbound the game out now on Steam that's also having a free DLC available during the Steam summer sale which ends on July 13th the game's also having a 20 discount so you can get this one and the free DLC today with the link Down Below in the description if you want to grab it for yourself and of course today's episode is sponsored by the makers of Raven bound so thanks to them for sponsoring if you're a big fan of games like valheim for example this has all that awesome Scandinavian folklore that we've enjoyed many a time in many different games on this channel but this one doing it in the format of a roguelite adventure game a little bit of an RPG where of course cards and things that we get between each battle or rather each life is going to help us with each run so our life is kind of intended to be limited here we're not supposed to be very strong but really we're playing like a raven that can take these here of different characters that are kind of just randomly generated but what's most important is the cards that you bring with you from Battle to battle or rather just like run to run whoa that was a big old jump there nice so anyway I'm going around Gathering coins and whatnot and we're in the kind of tutorial area where it's just teaching us how to play the game again and I thought it a good opportunity to show off the very opening of the game where we can fly around as the Raven too so let's go ahead and finish up this uh trial or challenge in order to then leave the tutorial area and go to the open world this game is an open world you know RPG Survival action combat game with a lot of different elements to you know blocking and uh dodging and pairing there's a lot of timing to this one and it is a very very very very challenging game I got absolutely clobbered the first time but I did like the open world elements and the world design which is really breathtaking at the start and all the trees and whatnot are very nice too and the rocks and all the different temples and things that you can encounter and enemies too are quite fun until they kill you in about one second all right let's go ahead and jump out of here and see what we can do we'll go up to the top of the tower so as I mentioned your strategy is based on the cards that you unlock and play and you can travel across the whole world as a raven so there's immediately fast travel unlocked in the form of kind of a mount except you become the mount which is pretty cool too uh here's a few enemies here that are going to teach us some more of the basics uh Elites here are some of the enemies that will have to fight towards later parts of the game now of course I'm blocking a little too early so but yeah if you're a big fan of games like for example the most recent Star Wars game of well Fallen order or Survivor or any sort of game like valheim it's kind of a combination of both of them with a lot of combat that yeah heavily relies on your timing now these guys are going to be nice to us you know we can just pick damage all day and we'll take like one or two hit points since it's just a tutorial area but we can regain health of course by blocking and then doing damage to the enemy we've got a lot of different moves and right now I've chosen for this character a um a little bit more health and we could also get a little uh yeah nice little you saw their grappling hook yeah so we can pull ourselves out of battle in order to line the enemies up perfectly for like for example a like a perfectly timed block I'm still practicing but there we go I'm learning as I go on so yeah the problems in this game that you'll have to overcome of course are a large number of enemies like how are you going to deal with crowd control and cards of course could be the solution for that and or your strategy as you play more of course there's other things to find to chests and other drops and enemies that will of course drop fragments to that and there's lore there's tons of lore with ruins all around that have that runic writing on them uh you know you might recognize it from all the Viking games ever that of course tell a story of what's going on here behind the scenes all right well let's go ahead and collect all the fragments then and we'll be out of here and have one more around here and there we go perfect becoming a vessel all right yeah so is as we die we of course exit this Mortal coil and then uh basically can pick our run again by customizing with these cards so uh from the three fragments we just got we can now pick different cards to apply to our character over on the left side you can see my equipment at the top which is our sword and shield and below that is our our tunic or like our armor and then traits are below that as well we've got a lot of things to unlock such as these Relic cards so that's pretty cool so we can increase stagger impact weapon damage and or critical hits by 30 and have a chance to increase bleeding overall I think I'll choose the uh or bone needle so that way we can increase that by 60 which is a pretty damn big jump for sure so uh before each jump we can also customize our characters and that of course includes our weapons class and traits so it's not just in the battle that we can modify these things but also afterwards as we die in between and we'll have to get our hatred level up and uh luck and guard critical chance and critical damage as you see down below at the bottom so we don't have enough of Mana in order to equip this so that'll be our next goal is to try to go and find some of that in the open world area now the DLC that's out for free remember is out until the 13th and it's known as hammers of a vault and there are other DLCs and uh pretty good Community out there too for oh look at this secret area oh yeah there we go that's what I wanted to do yeah the community is giving a lot of feedback to the devs too in fact right on the uh Opening screen there uh they do and I think even when you pause they ask for feedback on what you like what you don't like what you think should be changed and to me that's always a great sign of a good development team when they're not not only just open to feedback but literally just being like hey press this button and let us know uh what what you might be thinking right now as you play let's go nice I'm thinking I need more gold there we go so cracking open pots is a good way to find that of course I'm a little bit of a loot Goblin in these types of games but I certainly want to break everything open and see what I can do to find more stuff there's also the ability I didn't show it in our last battle there but of course to lock onto enemies and that does make the combat a little bit more fluid too going from enemy a b and c oh I don't want to fall down there do I the grappling hook was a cool touch rather than a double jump we get to jump even further than that and it's in combination with the raven that we get to play as well and of course the interesting story that you saw right at the beginning yeah character design looking pretty damn nice now I think based on our armor I think our character's appearance will change too so when I first went in I don't think I had this helmet and or this tunic so as we gather more armor we can switch that out and our parent our appearance will change and it'll be the same when we pick a new vessel because we're gonna die we are going to die I'm not I'm not going to live very long in this game and that's the point we're supposed to then grind our way up and go through many different changes as a player and as a character in order to unlock better abilities there we go class oh yeah oh okay okay there we go Quest complete we are now bird congratulations all right so they want us to go to some of these other locations this is the world map as it is and they want us to go explore and start on our quests and side quests and mini quests really all the quests are open this is you know completely open as to where we can fly and go fight in but as you see there there's side quests and Main quests in blue side quest in green we can also or speed up and slow down and uh yeah so we can go to this secondary Quest down here and see what it'll offer us very nice by the way that the Fast Travel is just us actually flying around because there is quite a lot of beautiful landscape to look at and if you're a big fan of Skyrim or whatnot the mountains are just very nice to look at as you make your way around of course lots of little landmarks battles and other hidden things around that we'll have to discover and explore as we play Let's go ahead and zoom in here literally zoom in completing a side quest will reward us with 100 coins pounding out this area looks like an enemy camp of some sort hmm all right let's uh take a peek and see what what it's got in store for us visit the village of volkis till the hall Raven's eye ah this gives us a tactical view of Who's Who and what's what it's transform let's get a little closer hi guys that's pretty cool you thought I was a bird didn't you I got you hey how's it going all right so it looks like some enemies attacked a Healer and they want us to go get a little bit of Revenge and or make the area safe again thieves without Hearts okay well certainly looks nice buildings under construction lots of wood being stored granaries and guard towers Palisades quite nice for what seems to be an ordinary Village and a sigilant lock only be opened with the sigil key oh and now we get a new reward hatred level reached your weapons and armor affected by either armor erosion or blunted Edge are restored oh so there's a little bit of durability vendors prices affected by Trader restored hatred level reduced by one down to a minimum of zero oh I guess we want that to be low well I guess I will go with the equipment restored but we I think get to choose that at any time we're collecting the car we're not necessarily using the card so there's two cards we can play here as they mentioned before we'll need to get our Mana up for something like this but this one will be free at zero we've only got one Mana now you see that in the upper right corner looks like we have a key and 20 gold up there in the upper right corner so we can't just turn into a bird everywhere we have to go to these little beacons so that way it kind of balances that out a little bit between uh having forced fights that of course you can go into and then also you know kind of a fast traveler a faster travel I did notice that there was a vendor here though I do want to actually take a look at what that might be and what they might want to trade oh sorry to cut in line sir hello ah we could unlock a relic slot for 50. very nice well I don't have the coin for that but we can come back hi there how you doing okay let's go ahead and do this Mission then so uh green should indicate where we have to go so down that away let's uh just proceed on foot I love the design of the little village buildings oftentimes I I'm getting very impressed with how buildings are looking in game I know it's completely off topic but honestly it adds to the immersion fully how wonderfully beautiful Villages look and how they're well laid out having some sort of a design as if it were a survival city Builder things like a.
