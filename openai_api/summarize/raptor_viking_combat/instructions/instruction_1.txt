hunter Granary main hall Brewery that type of thing it's nice to see in these games and I want some of these buildings to be like 3D print I want to collect these buildings and before we took our very first look at this game the developers were kind enough to send over a little uh like a press pack with a lot of little goodies inside things like a like a mug and um some I think a letter opener that was a sword and some other in-game art and uh looks like there's a lot of care to both the design of the items that your character will use and then just the random things that your character can get when they're being made oh hi there when they're randomly created oh wow all right looks like they're having no problem taking care of some of these guys bodies right outside the village all right let's go so pretty peaceful so far okay let the fun begin I see oh wow nice oh damn Spider-Man hi what you guys gonna do about that rambling Hook is underrated oh okay oh I'm bleeding now oh whoa whoa nice let's try Dodge that worked pretty good nice because my cam now oh we got some booty over here what do we got open a hatred chest numerous lost Mana or chains of for a moment I read in before mint yes get give me that one the one with the beef I can't pick it though so let's go with the Lost Mana damn I wanted the beef cool now we got a lot of cool cards now again remember whenever we die we get to uh kind of create a new character with those so collecting all this is pretty nice for future builds and or that we could use now okay so the camp is ours oh and that is what they need back at the other camp a box of herbs and oils Raven towers around oh lots of ravens indeed well let's go back down this way or we could turn in our Quest okay I was just looking to see if there was more loot don't see any other boxes so let's go ahead and turn this one in so yeah remember we can't turn into a bird until we go to those transmogification type dealies you know the thing where we can just turn into a bird fly and land anywhere we can land anywhere and turn back into a human but when it comes to Flying we got to go to those things specifically all right let's go back to turn in this Quest feels good man whoa hi how much for that where'd you get that helmet I want that or is that literally a deer head hold on I want that are you an actual deer person I have no I have no idea but I want that all right oh yeah wait this is like a deer Village are deer villagers they're so near and dear to our heart all right well all done job done money received oh 100 coin now may I have A Relic slot please thank you and let's go ahead and take a look here got Mana game three Mana let's do that and then we should be able to use our ore bone needle which increases weapon damage by 60. nice although I still feel like our weapon's a little light now we can do even more damage so right these bird symbols like what we saw earlier we just fly back but it was a short distance let's go somewhere else now well let's go do a main quest thing shall we which is over this way bird looks cool I don't know if there's customization options for the burb but uh would be nice another opportunity to just change the colors and whatnot doesn't exist I wouldn't be surprised if the community gives feedback oh boy well down there is probably where I'm gonna die I remember this place before the side quest behind us though we might have more of a chance to survive so let's see what happens again surprise ah did you guys miss me I bet you did Luke goblets that one's a bigger loot Goblin than me oh I hit the pillar did it make it mad Hamp conquered oh okay these enemies were much easier than I remember all right cleansed chest they have a light emitting from them and we can uh grab some items out of them find an open chest we can't carry any more fragments we walk out of here now hope we're not leaving anything behind all right so there's a few around us ooh pretty flowers we gotta go to each of the blue dots but they're all within about 500 meters of where we are now any enemies oh hi good Batman wow oh sad I can't carry any more fragments well let's go ahead and gain more Mana take a look at our codex we got tutorials for all sorts of things and also lore that's nice anytime we read one of those discs that are in the game with the runes I mentioned earlier we can come back to the Codex and get additional information well that's what we're looking for item acquired oh somewhere in the current region a golden pot filled with 200 coins will appear nice draw three cards from your deck and choose one to add to your hand gotta go with that loot Goblin give me that one all right let's go to the next one maybe over here this one's only 200 away oh man beautiful flowers weeds bushes lots of layering of vegetation on top of each other looks good I love the surprise combat I'm really a jerk you know they're hanging out chilling maybe having a barbecue and here I come with the whole like hey I'm gonna kill your friends stagger you do a bunch of damage oh there's your chest Don't Mind If I Do once you regain your lost Health to Mana or unlock one Relic slot I would like that please okay on to another camp so I suppose this is a part of our character building where we're gaining a little bit of experience for ourselves in pretty simple combat in the opening area so we understand how to play a little bit more outside the tutorial additionally we're building our characters characters more than one meaning that we of course have access to more cards when we die and or when we explore the world we'll learn a little bit more about where things are which types of combat missions or quests are a little more challenging challenging and then if we want to do those on each specific run we can do that too so maybe one run we want to go and try to find a bunch of gold and do missions that give us the most amount of gold and then spend that gold on shops do a money run or go for bosses and try to gain the most amount of progress defeating them by getting very powerful weapons and equipment oh man this is cool all right top of the mountain we go pretty round Tower I want to sneak in through the window oh well per usual here I come just asserting my dominance as I come in thank you wow that was great there was blood everywhere on that one it's like playing Mortal Kombat or something geez actually getting real focused on the combat here and enjoying it a bit numerous lost Mana really wish I could carry some more fragments choose a reward oh we got better armor oh better weapon too no when taking damage from uh tooth tier increased by 100 percent let me go with that there we go perfect better armor hatred gained from empowering fragments will fill the bars in the lower right corner now I can grab more fragments I think that was the right time to do that and those are pretty easy to acquire by each enemy another sigil key more info coming in about the hatred certainly a few game mechanics that I think are easy to learn and easy to keep track of nothing that's too complicated aside from blocking pairing and then building your character it looks like we're all done here and we're free to move about the cabin then we'll head down here now to our next Quest we have to empower fragments two more times and find one more box I believe I wonder if there's fall damage let's try I'm assuming there is and it's probably quite generous with how much damage he'll take again asserting dominance when we rock in the into place there we go nice [Music] wow more fragments for me all right worn twin swords worn arms worn great acts ooh let's go with the Warren Great ax going from 31 to 47. and then we should be able to repair that I believe I'd like to hope that did some sort of a benefit it was a good time to use it oh and look at that our armor actually has changed badass oh we look absolutely badass and that's a bad ax too that's really cool no more Shield or rather we have a shield but not in the traditional sense of made of wood sharp and blade increases weapon damage of currently equipped Weapon by 10 percent get some coins or increase armor currently equipped armor by three I want 10 more damage and I want it now all right so now are we heading I can see a small Beacon down there we'll go fly around we just need to get into more fights to do this some of the fragments I left behind we could go back for but we can always get some new ones there we go there's a bird Shrine over there we should be able to fast travel what who is this are you guys Elites hi there oh [Music] the combat has finally got much more fast paced oh nice our weapon is a lot slower too so a different gameplay style to get used to compared to the sword and shield there's a noticeable difference and that's cool that it's not just a kind of a visually different weapon but it does feel a lot different too that's really nice draw a new copy of a card you have already played in this run that is not foresight let's go with that one two more Mana foreign and even more Mana for us cool it was good to clear out the map a little bit with all these things we'll need the sigil key to continue to clear those but time to be light as a feather make another tough enemy group here well hello oh juggernaut all right foreign charge up time yeah wow lawn mowered uh that is a very good weapon for uh dealing with attacks from behind because as we're dealing with one enemy the weapon of course will go 360. Health increased by 30 percent drauger deterring armor we can lower their attack ability there I think I'm gonna go with the bone needle again and increase weapon damage by another 60 percent now we're doing 120 more damage I believe chains have been beefalment again sometimes good things sometimes bad things all right make your way to the tomb of gales I'm kicking butt oh hold on what is that I wanna there was a symbol there for something big and bad all right the tomb of gales is right up here across a river and go up top now it does seem like there's cards that will restore our health but it's a little more Rando as we go on this run further things are getting a little bit more challenging for us hi there bro you a kitty sweet thanks Kitty I think where we can fly is easily marked by those birds on the uh on the map too in the world [Music] nice the tomb has opened open sesame sesame seed chicken oh a big oh nice oh oh a big boss battle foreign oh damn calm down bro getting lawnmowered of course dodging at the last second giving us a little bit of a boost to our frenzy which will do Big O damage but dodging like that is exactly what we want to do man he's like on roller skates that purple stuff is good laughs oh that's not good though oh my God it's like fighting the damn Pyramid Head from on the hill too chill bro I was trying to get real close to him to try to get him to trigger his attack oh man we're about halfway on that one a little bit but the vessel has fallen we died as I predicted but that is one of the hatred bosses cool we killed 22 Elites did 770 damage to the boss and uh all I feel like we could have taken him on if I had to continue to build up my bigo power is there of course to uh double our damage in frenzy mode but regardless what's most important here is that we've unlocked cards that we get to use again so even though we did and pretty good our first run we're gonna do even better each time and that's what makes this a roguelike this is what the gameplay Loop is like.
