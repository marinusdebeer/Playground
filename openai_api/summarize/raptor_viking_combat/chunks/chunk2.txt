and this is what's satisfying to be able to like be like oh man I died I got to do all that again but because we're rewarded well now we get to go in as a different character with a different build find different cards there's a lot of RNG you know random number generation which will give us different perks and different uh cards to be unlocked through these boxes and or you know fragments from killing enemies too so a big old skill tree in this one that goes uh all the way from top to bottom of this raven here giving us different things like for example uh blood fueled all the way down to like uh death of a Thousand Cuts which is just a permanent reduced base damage but multi-strike increased by 30. so we can build things that way too so we get better bigger and stronger every time that we play and I I like that I like I'm I'm really starting to like roguelites a lot more for that purpose and then we can of course go back and see all the cars that we've unlocked or learn more about the ones that we possibly haven't that they'll unlock at other levels so we can kind of get prepared to see what our rewards will be when we get to for example level 13. now our protect guard inflicts Frozen on attacker that kind of thing so not bad 159 out of 213 cards unlocked so and of course the DLC will enter add a lot more go ahead and enter another Vault there's also Daily challenges we'll get bonuses for that too so there's obviously reasons to play day after day let's go ahead and uh not enter the the menu screen but the enter a vault there we go and so now we just get a random human doesn't necessarily matter these are just Champions that will kind of take control of his a vessel but really what matters is the fact that we get different armor and the things that we get to bring along with us this kind of uh character has a hammer specialist first time we had a sword and a shield from our tutorial area now we get something with a little bit more defensive armor Hammer specialist and a human who whenever they drain a card gets 50 coins so yeah different each time for their folk weapon class and unique trait and then of course we add more to that too which is pretty sweet now if you don't like that if you're if you're not feeling that character you can always hold right to re-roll which I just did I don't think it costs anything but it's totally fine to just kind of keep re-rolling if you want to or change some of your stats that way through weapon class it looks like a pair of dice down there so it feels like it's re-rolling but looks like it's kind of just re-rolling their appearance and their specialty a little bit maybe really cool to see an actual Archer I don't know if there's a range class but there could be weapons like that maybe a javelin that we get to throw to that must be what our character was before generalists but I wouldn't mind making it Hammer Time yeah I think that would be just fine oh cool you can actually oh left to randomize your character too so if you're not uh happy with their hairstyle or something well you have to change the whole character but you know you could go from being the big old bigger the brownie guy to uh various characters of different age [Music] and a few different colors of their clothing although generally the same because it'll be based on the armor not bad not bad at all you know I truly enjoyed the time I had here today with Raven bound and if you want to check it out for yourself again check down below in the description where you can get ravenbaum for 20 off during the Steam summer sale until July 13th and the Hammers of a vault DLC is also free during the summer sale of course this action roguelite with open world freedom is not going to be the only time we see it here today I think I also want to do another video on this to continue to explore the cards that we've unlocked and also do some live streams just for fun in the future because this is certainly the type of game that feels like it's very easy to pick up play for a little while either you can continuously play on and on and on or just do so in short little runs which is fun yeah the vast island of a vault very very fun I like it flying around as a raven adapt your strategy based on the cards you unlock and play and kind of customize your characters each time you do so all right everybody well that is it for now thank you very much for watching and I'll see you all next time goodbye .
