The author, Marques Brownlee, shares his experience of going solar and becoming energy independent. He explains that he has not paid for electricity in a year, thanks to his solar panels and battery storage system. He has a variety of electrical appliances, including computers, game consoles, TVs, and air conditioning, and he also drives an electric car. Brownlee's goal was to drive electric and ensure that the energy he uses comes from a sustainable source, the sun.

He explains that a key part of his solar system is the battery storage. In a normal house, electricity is pulled from the grid, and the meter tallies the usage, which is then billed at the end of the month. When solar panels are added to the house, they can directly power the appliances during the day, but when the sun goes down, the electricity generated goes to zero. This means that most people still rely on the grid for their electricity usage in the evenings and at night. However, with the addition of battery storage, excess solar energy can be stored during the day and used at night, allowing the homeowner to be completely independent from the grid.

Brownlee explains that he chose to go with Tesla for his solar system, as he wanted simplicity and integration. He opted for Tesla's solar roof, which consists of solar tiles that look like normal roof tiles. He acknowledges that he didn't actually need a new roof, but chose this option for aesthetic and coverage reasons. He describes the process he went through, including paperwork, measurement, and installation, and mentions that it took eight months from the time he signed the purchase agreement to the activation of the system.

He then delves into the numbers and specs of his solar system. His solar array size is 29.313 kilowatts, and he has three Tesla Powerwall batteries, totaling 40.5 kilowatt hours of storage capacity. He highlights the Tesla app, which allows him to monitor and control the system. He explains that kilowatts measure power, while kilowatt hours measure energy collected. He observes that different appliances consume different amounts of energy, such as TVs, computers, microwaves, and toasters. However, he notes that air conditioning and charging the electric car are the two largest draws of electricity in his home.

Brownlee goes on to discuss the performance of his solar system throughout the seasons. He mentions that summer days in New Jersey are excellent for solar power, as they provide long daylight hours and plenty of sun. He shows a typical summer day in the app, with energy production peaking around noon and gradually decreasing until sunset. He also mentions that winter days have fewer daylight hours and less energy production, but overall, he is satisfied with his system's performance throughout the seasons.

In conclusion, Brownlee shares his positive experience of going solar and achieving energy independence. He highlights the importance of battery storage in maximizing self-sustainability and reducing reliance on the electrical grid. He acknowledges the process and paperwork involved in installing a solar system, but emphasizes the benefits of clean and sustainable energy.
