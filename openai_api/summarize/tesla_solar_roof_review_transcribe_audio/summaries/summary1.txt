Throughout the year, the author's solar setup generated varying amounts of electricity depending on the season and weather conditions. During the summer, he generated around 200 kilowatt hours of electricity per day, with some days reaching up to 260 kilowatt hours. In the fall, his solar production decreased, but his energy needs also decreased, resulting in his home being completely powered by solar. However, during the winter, the author's solar production was significantly lower due to shorter days and cloudy weather, and he had to rely more on the grid for electricity, especially for heating and charging his electric car. Despite this, in the spring, the author saw his solar production pick up again, with May being the month where he generated the most excess solar. The author also discusses the financial aspects of his solar setup, including the cost of installation, tax credits, and the payback period, which he estimates to be around 9.6 years. He also mentions some quirks and considerations of having a solar system, such as net metering credits and the potential for using more electricity to shorten the payback period. Overall, the author is satisfied with his solar system and the benefits of clean and sustainable energy.
