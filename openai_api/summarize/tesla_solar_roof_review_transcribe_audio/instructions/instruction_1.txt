The author, Marques Brownlee, shares his experience of going solar and becoming energy independent. He explains that he has not paid for electricity in a year, thanks to his solar panels and battery storage system. He has a variety of electrical appliances, including computers, game consoles, TVs, and air conditioning, and he also drives an electric car. Brownlee's goal was to drive electric and ensure that the energy he uses comes from a sustainable source, the sun.

He explains that a key part of his solar system is the battery storage. In a normal house, electricity is pulled from the grid, and the meter tallies the usage, which is then billed at the end of the month. When solar panels are added to the house, they can directly power the appliances during the day, but when the sun goes down, the electricity generated goes to zero. This means that most people still rely on the grid for their electricity usage in the evenings and at night. However, with the addition of battery storage, excess solar energy can be stored during the day and used at night, allowing the homeowner to be completely independent from the grid.

Brownlee explains that he chose to go with Tesla for his solar system, as he wanted simplicity and integration. He opted for Tesla's solar roof, which consists of solar tiles that look like normal roof tiles. He acknowledges that he didn't actually need a new roof, but chose this option for aesthetic and coverage reasons. He describes the process he went through, including paperwork, measurement, and installation, and mentions that it took eight months from the time he signed the purchase agreement to the activation of the system.

He then delves into the numbers and specs of his solar system. His solar array size is 29.313 kilowatts, and he has three Tesla Powerwall batteries, totaling 40.5 kilowatt hours of storage capacity. He highlights the Tesla app, which allows him to monitor and control the system. He explains that kilowatts measure power, while kilowatt hours measure energy collected. He observes that different appliances consume different amounts of energy, such as TVs, computers, microwaves, and toasters. However, he notes that air conditioning and charging the electric car are the two largest draws of electricity in his home.

Brownlee goes on to discuss the performance of his solar system throughout the seasons. He mentions that summer days in New Jersey are excellent for solar power, as they provide long daylight hours and plenty of sun. He shows a typical summer day in the app, with energy production peaking around noon and gradually decreasing until sunset. He also mentions that winter days have fewer daylight hours and less energy production, but overall, he is satisfied with his system's performance throughout the seasons.

In conclusion, Brownlee shares his positive experience of going solar and achieving energy independence. He highlights the importance of battery storage in maximizing self-sustainability and reducing reliance on the electrical grid. He acknowledges the process and paperwork involved in installing a solar system, but emphasizes the benefits of clean and sustainable energy.

Please provide a detailed summary of the following: 
And on this day, it generated a ridiculous 260 kilowatt hours of electricity. Not all days are going to look like perfect curves like this, by the way. In fact, the previous day was pretty cloudy. So you can see it only generated 65 kilowatt hours. The next previous was better again. But yeah, a typical summer day, you know, get around 200 kilowatt hours from the sun. And then I think this view is the most helpful. It looks kind of wild at first, but you can quickly tell how to read it. It's basically how much power the house is taking and then where it's getting that power from. So overnight, you can see these spikes from the house are where I'm pulling from the grid. This is actually just air conditioning overnight. And then when the sun comes out and the day heats up and the air conditioner turns on the lights and the appliances, everything comes on, it starts drawing more power. But it's totally covered by solar, as you can see here. And it's also filling up the power walls with extra solar as this happens. So later in the day, when the sun goes down, that power draw is also supplemented by the power wall batteries. There were a lot of summer days like this on the absolute best day in this time. I think I generated almost 300 kilowatt hours of electricity. But because of how much the house is using from the AC to charging the car every single day, frequently I'd use 200 plus kilowatt hours of electricity during the day. So my net grid usage would typically in these summer months be zero to slightly negative, maybe up to negative 50 kilowatt hours on a good day, meaning I would generate and sell back to the grid 50 kilowatt hours more than I used solid. So after summer, there is the fall, which, you know, the days are starting to get a little bit shorter, but also notably the temperatures drop off quite a bit. So getting less, a little bit less sun, but also using a lot less air conditioning. So here is a normal fall day in the middle of October production day by day is dropping down now here into the low hundreds. This is a day that I got just over 120 kilowatt hours of solar, pretty cloud free day again, as you can tell by the graph. And again, if you look at the home usage, there's even smaller spikes and a smaller curve of air conditioning during the day. So the house's needs are actually completely covered by solar. And then once the sun goes down and the power wall takes over, it actually did not touch the grid at all, which is pretty sick. And this was actually very common throughout the fall. Turns out the fall and the spring are the times where I generated the most excess electricity with basically every day ending with net negative. And then there's winter and it turns out a winter can be as well in the Northeast here is especially brutal on these setups for a couple of reasons. Like first of all, as far as solar, these are the days when we're getting the days of the shortest, like the sun sets at like 4 PM, which is insane, but that's real. But it also turns out that most of the days are cloudy. I didn't really realize this like truly until I started looking through all the graphs, but it's like one out of every 10 days is actually sunny. And I, you know, I know it's cold and everything, but I didn't realize how many days in the winter are just cloud cover all day. So then also my home's, uh, I'm pointing like you can see it. My home's air conditioning is electric, but my heating is natural gas. So my natural gas bill is just going up and there's nothing my solar can do about it. But on top of all of that, you got to think about the car and electric cars are far less efficient in the winter when it's cold than any other time of the year. Batteries have a certain temperature. They like to be at, they like to operate at that temperature. So they spend more extra energy getting up to and staying at that temperature. So a normal drive for me might take say 15% of the battery on a commute during the summer. That same drive during the winter will take 20, 25, 30% of the battery driving the exact same way just because it's so cold. So that is a lot more electrical energy. So here's what some typical days in the winter would look like. Literally only generating 20 to 70 kilowatt hours of electricity in a whole day. Like cloudy days would literally only be a handful. And then for home use. So I actually went through this phase of like, maybe I should charge my car less often to be off the grid more. I was kind of playing around with that. So I would charge like every two to three days, but it honestly doesn't really matter. You can sort of see which days I actually plug the car in. And to be fair, the power wall handled it, but it did empty it out. So the next day I'm pulling from the grid until the sun comes up. So it was basically like a lot of days around zero. And then every time I had to plug in the car to fill back up, there would be a huge dent, just a huge positive net use day on the calendar. So I actually had positive net grid usage months for all of November, December, and January. So I was pulling from the grid more than I produce solar all of those months. But then sure enough, when we get to spring, things flip super fast. It turns out if you were to guess which month I would generate the most solar or the most excess solar, what would you think? You'd probably guess like sometime in the peak of the summer with the longest day, June, For me, it was May. In May, I used 6,500 kilowatt hours of electricity, but I generated nearly 8,500 kilowatt hours of electricity. And I didn't even realize, this is another thing you don't really know for real until you look at the data and I'm looking at the graphs and May had basically every single day sunny during that month. I think I had one cloudy day in May. But June and July, we do get a lot more thunderstorms out here in the Northeast. And that actually does take a real hit on total solar. That's cloud cover. So they didn't generate quite as much solar as May. We're just learning weather patterns out here through graphs of solar generation. This is also around the same month that I got the Eight Sleep. So the Eight Sleep is a pod cover that fits on a mattress like a fitted sheet, but it's temperature controlled. So it can heat and cool each side of the bed independently. They reached out around May to be a sponsor and I said yes. So that's when I installed it. I wouldn't say it replaced the need for air conditioning. It didn't, but it did actually legitimately decrease the total air conditioning you need when the bed is cooled off and the house doesn't have to be as cool. So when it literally cools the bed before you get in, stays cool the whole night for optimal sleep and then warms you up in the morning on autopilot every single day, which is sweet. So now that I know that air conditioning is the number two draw of electricity in my entire house and if you don't drive an electric car, it's probably your number one draw. Then it's good to know that you can, you can do something like this and obviously it'll take a lot less electricity from the wall than air conditioning would. Also if you're curious, I talked about this on Dope Tech, but it's turned out to be pretty awesome. Obviously sleep is super important and temperature is like top of the list for sleep quality, falling asleep faster, waking up less. So investing in your sleep makes a ton of sense on top of maybe cutting into your AC use. You can actually use code MKBHD on their site and get $200 off. So I'll leave a link in the description and thanks again to Eight Sleep for sponsoring the video. So it's time for the big summary. I've had this solar setup for a full year now, all four seasons. It's time to run the numbers, see if it was really worth it and see if it's actually good. So let's start with the money question here. The, this, like I said, was nowhere near the cheapest possible option. Of course, going with solar panels and batteries, a lot of different possible setups. So my setup with the solar tiles, all of the materials, all of the labor installation, everything, and the three batteries, everything together was $120,948.04, but also, as you can see, there's a federal tax credit down here of nearly $30,000, bringing the total cost to me down to right around $93,000. So the tax credit does fluctuate quite a bit. It's actually gone up like a lot since I ordered like a year and a half ago, whatever it was. It's up to 30% now in New Jersey. So it's called the New Jersey solar investment tax credit. If I ordered today, it would have been $8,000 more off, but you know, it's fine. It's fine. Everything's fine. I'm not mad. It's fine. But the main question you typically see with an investment like this is what is the payoff period? How long does it take before that investment pays for itself in saved electricity? So that's a good question. I had to do quite a bit of math here because every bill is different. Every week, every month of electricity costs different amounts. Actually, my provider literally has different electricity rates every single hour and there are different averages per day, per week, per season. But if I do a sort of a sweeping average for each month and how much electricity I've been using, the 54 megawatt hours of electricity that I've used in the past year would have cost about $9,660. So again, it's a lot, but obviously air conditioning takes up a lot and a lot of that is driving an electric car every single day. So of course my gas bill has been $0 this whole time, but that's where it comes from. So if you divide that out by the total cost that I paid, it comes out to just under 10 years, 9.6 years. So if you Google like, what's a good payback period for a solar setup? The answer that the AI pops up with is like six to 10 years, which if I think about it and makes sense, obviously, and that's great because if the panels are warrantied for 25 years and you pay them off in 10 years, then they're just paying you extra for the next 15 years, however long you're in that house, which is great. So mine being on the longer end of that, am I mad at that? Not really, I think that's fine. I also do know that there are a couple of things that could have been different to make that payback period shorter. Now, actually the number one suggestion typically would be like, okay, if you wanna make the payback period shorter, get a less expensive setup. And that would make sense, but also you have to keep in mind, the coverage really matters here. So I could have gone with a much less expensive, actually a solar panel array from Tesla on this same exact roof. And because of all the pitches on the roof, they estimated they could have put panels down on certain parts that would have totaled a smaller 19 kilowatt array instead of the 29 kilowatts of the solar tiles. I know that because that's actually what I first signed up for an estimate for, as I was like juggling the idea in my head. Would that have had a shorter payback period or would that have been offset by much less electricity being produced and taking longer to pay for itself? I don't know. But the other part of that equation that I'm thinking about now is just like, I should just use more electricity so that it pays for itself faster. I wanna get my values worth. I am constantly in net negative so I can afford to use way more electricity. And so I thought maybe about switching, various appliances that aren't electric yet, maybe even switching heating to electrical. So that may be in my future. But now for all of the miscellaneous weird quirks of having this brand new piece of tech on top of my house, because believe me, there are quite a few. So first of all, on the $0 electricity bill for the whole year, that is real, which is pretty awesome. But it's also interesting that I was able to achieve the $0 bill monthly, but I also used positive net grid energy for those three months during the winter. So you might be wondering, wait a second, how does that work? And the answer is net metering credits.
