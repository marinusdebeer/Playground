Please provide a detailed (keep as much detail as possible) summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
During a subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs, the lack of transparency and accountability in the government's handling of UAP incidents was discussed. The chair of the subcommittee expressed concerns about the erosion of public trust and referenced prominent figures, such as Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, who have reported UAP sightings.   The All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Officer (AARO) and the National Security Agency (NASSA) were established to coordinate efforts in detecting, identifying, and investigating UAPs, but their lack of transparency and accountability was concerning. The chair emphasized the need for government transparency and accountability in UAP-related matters and called for improved reporting systems for both the military and civilians. They expressed gratitude to the witnesses for their participation and dedication to safeguarding the American people's interests.   Representative Burchard from Tennessee acknowledged the nonpartisan nature of the UAP issue and thanked his colleagues for their support. He acknowledged the difficulties in organizing the hearing and called for government transparency and trust. He stated that they would focus on facts and uncover any cover-ups.   Representative Luna from Florida acknowledged the captivation of UAP sightings for decades and highlighted the lack of transparency and failure to release explanations, footage, and classified documents by the government, leading to public skepticism. She emphasized the need for an open-minded discussion and understanding of the magnitude of UAPs. She also mentioned concerns raised by service members who fear retribution for reporting UAP sightings.   Representative Garcia, the ranking member of the subcommittee, thanked the witnesses for their service and bravery in sharing their experiences. He acknowledged the importance of their testimonies and expressed gratitude to Congressman Burchard for bringing attention to the issue.   The hearing focused on the lack of transparency and accountability in UAP-related matters and the need for government transparency. The witnesses shared their experiences and provided compelling evidence. The members of the subcommittee showed a strong interest in understanding and addressing the UAP phenomenon.   The need for a secure reporting system for pilots, reducing stigma, and making information available to the public was highlighted. The importance of a centralized location for processing UAP information and establishing a two-way communication loop was emphasized. Concerns were raised about the lack of reporting and transparency in both the military and commercial aviation sectors.   The potential threat of UAPs to national security was addressed, highlighting the superior technology observed and the need to understand and respond to UAP encounters. The witnesses called for a system that encourages and facilitates civilian reporting.   Mr. Garcia expressed his support and willingness to work on legislation related to UAP reporting. Mr. Gresch believed that the government possesses information about UAPs based on interviews with witnesses. The importance of answering questions and finding answers was emphasized, and further collaboration on UAP reporting legislation was discussed.   Overall, the hearing emphasized the need for government transparency and accountability in UAP-related matters and highlighted the importance of open-minded discussion and understanding of UAP phenomena. The witnesses provided compelling evidence and called for improved reporting systems to address the UAP phenomenon effectively.

transparent to the level that we can yeah yeah and yeah I mean it's important I couldn't imagine you know I'm not a pilot but I used to fly gliders in Civil Air Patrol huh yeah I got a pilot yeah um and so either way I mean I couldn't imagine you know being being in the glider and seeing something and then not feeling like I had the agency to talk about it um Mr Graves can you discuss the importance of seeking scientists to sit on your Advisory Board absolutely I think ultimately this is going to be a scientific problem and not only that it's also an engineering problem I've been working with American Institute of Aeronautics and astronautics to help them stand up a UAP integration committee to help integrate their engineering prowess into this problem and so yes very much I think this is an engineering and scientific problem as much as national security problem and how might Congress help to facilitate Partnerships between the scientific community and the UAP focus groups within government well I think one of the things they can do is to have these types of hearings to communicate to the public that this is a topic of Interest I think that there is a pseudo-market if you will of interested capabilities and talent that want to approach this topic uh and we're seeing that start to grow now so I think continued conversation reduction of stigma is going to allow that to flourish and allow answers to help generate themselves 100 well thank you all for being here and thank you for your work I think it's important that we keep our top scientific Minds focused on this issue and look for ways to increase collaboration thank you so much I yield back Mr Comer thank you Mr chairman let me say I want to thank you for having this hearing I want to thank Mr burchett Miss Luna for leading this hearing and with that I yield my five minutes to Mr burchett thank you Mr chairman I'm going to direct this I believe to Mr grush but if any of you all feel like you need to jump in Just Jump Right In we're good as the U.S government become aware of actual evidence of extraterrestrial otherwise unexplained forms of intelligence and if so when do you think this first occurred use the term non-human I like to denote origin keeps the aperture open both scientifically certainly like I've discussed publicly uh previously 1930s okay can you give me the names and titles of the people with direct first-hand knowledge and access to some of this crash retrieval some of these crash retrieval programs and maybe which facilities military bases that would the recovered material would be in and I know a lot of Congress talked about we're going to go to Area 51 and you know I mean there's nothing there anymore anyway it's just you know and we move like a glacier as soon as we announce it I'm sure the moving vans would pull up but please uh I can't discuss that publicly but I did provide that information both to the Intel committees and the Inspector General and we could get that in this give if we were allowed to get in a skiff with you would that be probably what you would think sure if you had the appropriate accesses yeah what special access programs cover this information and how is it possible that they have evaded oversight for so long I do know the names once again I can't discuss that publicly and how they've evaded oversight I in a closed setting I can tell you the specific tradecraft use all right when did when do you think those programs began and who authorized them I do know a lot of that information but that's something I can't discuss publicly because since all right many of y'all want to jump in on any of this you're more than welcome to um what level of security clearance is required to fully access these programs and I say that because myself um representative Gates and representative Luna were basically turned away at one point at Eglin so please go right ahead uh certainly difference between member access and say somebody like me but anybody who has a you know tssci clearance and meets the eligibility criteria the access adjudicative Authority should be able to Grant you access Ms Merchant if you'll yield so just to be put a fine point on that there's nothing that you're aware of that's above special access program classification it's a misnomer that there's anything actually Above Top Secret executive order 13526 delineates the classification levels right and but I I draw upon on that because we can have access to to those programs and so the notion that we're not being given that access sort of defies our typical muscle memory here in Congress thank you Mr burchard I'll go back to you thank you Mr Gates um along those lines title tenant you might not know this or not but title 10 and title 50 authorization they seem to say they're inefficient it so who gets to decide this in your opinion in the past uh it's a group of career senior executive officials okay are they government officials they didn't announce do what both in and outs of government and that's about as far as all right well that's it leads to my next question which private corporations are directly involved in this program how much taxpayer money has been invested in these programs to your knowledge I mean we know we know we we audit the Pentagon every year and I've been here five years and they failed the dadgum thing every year uh lose over a billion dollars a year we think and I've told the Department of Defense maybe 60 percent of their assets are unaccounted for whatever the heck that means in the Public's sector you go to jail for that kind of crap so tell me yeah I know when I um I'm a dollar off of my DTS travel voucher I get the hammered but uh seems like it doesn't work if you sell over six if you sell over 600 worth of stuff on eBay now you get a call from the IRS so please what corporations yeah I don't know these specific metrics towards the end of your question uh the specific corporations I did provide uh to the Committees in specific divisions and uh I spent 11 and a half hours with both Intel committees okay has there been any has there been an active U.S government disinformation campaign to deny the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena and if so why it can't go beyond what I've already exposed publicly about that okay I've been told to ask you what that what that is and how to get it in the record which uh what have you stated publicly in your interviews for the Congressional Record uh yeah if you reference my news Nation interview and I talk about a multi-decade you know campaign to um just enfranchise public interest basically yeah apologize for Mr chairman I yield back negative 21 seconds thank you Ms oh come here ocasio-cortez uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you to our Witnesses for coming here today um I do concur with the ranking members well as several other members here on this committee that this is a committee for whistleblowers and for the protection of whistleblowers as well so we understand what you're putting um on the table here and we're putting on the line here and we thank you for that uh Mr Crush you sat on the unidentified anomalous phenomenon task force created in the 2020 ndaa correct yes there have been some things that uh that have been mentioned here during this hearing that I wanted to pick up on um Mr Graves you mentioned specifically during the answer to one of your questions you named Boeing contractors being engaged in an incident regarding this Red Cube about a football a football field wide I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the interaction or Mr gresh either of you the interactions between defense contractor companies and any UAP related programs or activities so I'll just say that the information about the contractor themselves were provided by a witness and I have no particular detail in that relationship Mr gresh the kind of General unclass wave tops certainly the contractors you know or the metal Benders so to speak the ones actually uh doing specific performance on government contracts are they required um to issue any disclosure regarding UAP sightings or do they engage in any reporting around this uh in terms of the contractors not that I'm aware of they do not okay now when it comes to notification that you had mentioned about um irap program I read programs we have seen defense contractors abuse their contracts before through this committee I have seen it personally and I have also seen the notification requirements to Congress abused um I am wondering one of the loopholes that we see in the law is that there is at least from my vantage point is that depending on what we're seeing is that there are no actual definitions or requirements for notification are there what methods of notification Did You observe like when they say they notified Congress how did they do that do you have insight into that for certain irad activities I can only think of one's conventional in nature um sometimes they throw flow through certain out of say sap programs that have cognizant authority over the Air Force or something and those are congressionally reported compartments but ired is literally internal to the contractor so as long as it's money either profits private investment Etc to put a finer point on it when there is a requirement for any agency or company to notify or any agency to notify Congress do they contact the chairman of a committee do they get them on the phone specifically is this through an email to hypothetically a dead email box a lot of it comes through what they call the PPR periodic program review process if it's a you know a sap or controlled Access program equity and then those go to the specific committees whether it be the SAS task to see thank you um I apologize I just my time is limited um it Mr Graves one of your main concerns that the FAA currently does not have an official process to receive reports of UAP from Pilots or others correct correct and um in your experience what data should the Aero program prioritize for potential collection we have you know location date time but are there other specific active characteristics that should be included in these reports certainly I think that there's two categories that would be important one would be kinematics and understanding the specifics of how the vehicle or objects are moving and the second would be a more zoomed out approach of being able to look at origin and destination after before the incident as well as getting a better contextual understanding of how these uh these objects are acting with each other thank you now I have a minute left I apologize we only have five minutes today but um for the record if you were me where would you look titles programs departments regions if you could just name anything and I put that as an open question to the three of you I'd be happy to give you that in a closed environment I can tell you specifically thank you um Commander fraver I would say and I've told people that you have to know where to look they're not going to divulge it to you because the classification levels but if you know where to look and who to talk to which is exactly Mr Gresham point you then you then you have them okay Mr Graves I was an operator so I was defending on folks like Mr garage to do that homework okay thank you very much are yield back to the chair Mr Biggs thanks thanks Mr chairman I think the witnesses for being here today I'm over here thank you so much for being here um I I want to get into uh specifics here and and the reason I'm going to go this way is because you've talked a bit about um what I would call misdirection by official U.S government with regard to uaps right and so I'm going to get to that in a second but last week White House Tennessee spokesman John Kirby stated that uaps are having an impact on our training ranges and need to be treated as a legitimate issue do you concur with the statements that's for each of you yes yes okay um now having said that I'm going to take you to specific instances around the Phoenix Valley because that's where I I live and in 97 we had the famous Phoenix light case I don't know if any of you are familiar with that there were there were two things that went along with that and the explanation was military training range off Luke and the Barry Goldwater range do you know anything different other than the official explanation of those lights only what's in the public vernacular about it that was outside the scope of my duties and if we wanted to just my question along with
