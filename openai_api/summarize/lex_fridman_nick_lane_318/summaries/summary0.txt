The source of energy at the origin of life is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This reaction releases energy and is less stable than cells. One possible environment on early Earth that matches the requirements of cells is created by hydrothermal vents, which generate hydrogen gas and electrical charges. However, oxygen makes it impossible for life to start, as hydrogen reacts with oxygen instead of CO2. There is a possibility that life originated multiple times on Earth, but oxygen limits the possibility. Life probably arose only once due to the deep split in biochemistry between bacteria and archaea. They are similar in some ways, such as having membranes and genetic code, but different in their DNA replication and enzymes. This suggests a common ancestor and the success of one cell taking over. When cells leave the vents, they need to power up their own membranes, which is achieved through pumping.
