There are different pumps that give electrical charges on the cell membranes of bacteria and eukaryotes, suggesting they emerged from a common ancestor. The DNA replication process differs in bacteria and eukaryotes due to their different membranes. Bacteria dominated the planet for billions of years without significant changes, while eukaryotic cells, like our own, emerged only once. Defining life is challenging as there are various definitions, but an important aspect is the ability to make a copy of oneself and parasitize the environment. Evolution occurs by making copies and sometimes introducing small or large errors. Michael Levin's work on electrical fields and development is groundbreaking.
