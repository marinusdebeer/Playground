The informative video discusses how astronomers are able to measure the distance between objects in the sky. Initially, the narration begins by talking about what local scientists did to measure distance. They used the concept of gravity and the elliptical movement of planets around the Sun to estimate the distance to the planets in our solar system. This allowed Johannes Kepler, a German astronomer, to develop ratios and equations which showed the average distance to each planet. However, this method only worked for objects within our solar system. 

To measure far-off stars, scientists relied on the parallax method. This involved observing the position of a star from two different points in the Earth's orbit around the Sun, and using known distances and angles, astronomers were able to calculate the distance to the star. 

One of the major breakthroughs was made by Henrietta Leavitt, a computer (an individual who performs complex calculations) at Harvard University. She observed that certain stars pulsed or cycled in brightness at a consistent rate, and using her graph (which plotted the period of pulsation against brightness) stars' distances could be determined. Edwin Hubble then used Leavitt's work to determine that the distant, fuzzy object he'd been observing was actually the Andromeda galaxy, proving that the Universe was larger than our own galaxy. This led to the revelation that there are billions of galaxies in the Universe. Such methods remain integral in measuring distances in space, thereby helping astronomers map out the night sky in 3D. 

Overall, the video explores the development and evolution of techniques that pioneering scientists used to ascertain the vastness of the Universe, which serve as building blocks for modern scientists who continue to map and discover objects in the cosmos.
