Global cabal theories are conspiracy theories that suggest there is a small group of people secretly controlling world events, such as wars, revolutions, epidemics, and more. These theories claim that this small cabal has malicious intentions and is responsible for all the negative occurrences in the world. The allure of these theories stems from their simplicity, as they provide a straightforward explanation for complex events. By attributing global problems to a single entity, it offers a way to shift responsibility away from individuals, allowing them to disassociate themselves from these problems. Furthermore, these theories create a utopian fantasy, suggesting that if this small cabal is eliminated, all the world's issues will be solved.

Historically, such theories have gained traction, with Nazism being a prime example. Nazis believed in a Jewish conspiracy theory, claiming that Jews controlled the world and that eliminating them would solve all problems. The appeal of these theories lies in their ability to provide a seemingly comprehensive explanation for events that appear contradictory. For instance, Nazis argued that capitalism and communism, seemingly opposing ideologies, were both controlled by the Jews, revealing the interconnectedness they believed existed within the global cabal.

However, these theories are inherently false. They propose two main ideas: that a small group of people control everything and that they do so in secret. Logically, it is implausible for a small group to have complete control and predict every event due to the complexity of the world. Real-life examples, such as the US invasion of Iraq, demonstrate even the most powerful entities can have their plans go awry. Moreover, secret cabals cannot gain power, as publicity is usually necessary to acquire significant influence. Even if a group were to accumulate power, unforeseen events frequently occur, undermining any notion of complete control or prediction.

Despite their inaccuracy, conspiracy theories persist by offering explanations for every occurrence, no matter how convoluted. However, it is essential to maintain intellectual integrity and recognize that complex explanations can justify any claim. Furthermore, while conspiracy theories stem from a legitimate fear of losing control and understanding of the world, they often lead to blaming specific individuals or groups. Rather than uniting against common threats like artificial intelligence and climate change, these theories foster division. It is crucial to question whether spreading hate or working on constructive projects is a more worthwhile use of time.

Ultimately, everyone has the power to contribute to making the world a better place. By focusing on areas within their agency and working together, individuals can make a difference, even if it may not solve all global problems. It is better to take action, hopeful that others will do the same, than succumb to cynicism and apathy. By recognizing that the real threats exist externally to humanity, and not within specific groups of people, we can foster greater unity and work collectively towards a better future.
