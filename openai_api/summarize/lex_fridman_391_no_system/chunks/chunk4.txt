both sides who have been killed many more Palestinians can you comment more about the situation I mean I think the The Washington Post article is a little bit more uh you know careful than other than other media that came out recently about Janine I think you know I was listening to our Reuters radio show and they failed to ever mention the occupation I don't I don't even think this paragraph mentioned that Janine is under occupation by the by the Israeli forces by the Israeli regime I think this is the most important piece of context that gets um obscured in our media reporting is these cities these refugee camps are under illegal occupation the Israeli Army has no business being there in the first place um that is the most that is the departure point that is the most important piece of context that will answer to you why these people um are arming themselves many of which by the way lived through the 2002 Massacre um and bombardment of Janine and grew up in the um violence um the the context that Palestine is under occupation that these Palestinian cities are under occupation that they have to deal with land seizures at all times that they cannot leave their towns um without a special permit all of this will give context to the violence and you know the thousands of Israeli soldiers that raided the camp that day that traumatized an entire generation they think they will quell that generation they think that with such Bloodshed and such barbaric violence destroying infrastructure attacking Medics killing people left and right they think with this kind of Terror that they can you know quell people tell people that you know they can guarantee that these kids are not going to grow up and resist but that's the opposite of what happens one thing about Palestinian people they will not compromise their dignity you know these people live in any live in dire excruciating circumstances and it is so courageous in my opinion that they even think um to defend themselves against one of the most lethal one of the most sophisticated armies in the world against the nuclear state that can wipe them out in the matter of seconds but it's not at the end of the day it's not even about courage it's about survival they don't do this because you know of machismo or because of uh heroic Tendencies it's because this is about survival so the degree there's violence it's about survival absolutely absolutely I think if there is no if there was no occupation there would be no violence it's it's quite obvious and again people understand this I mean like we saw on Twitter in in the recent month uh all of these Israeli uh propagandists who had tweeted pictures of like little girls with guns in Ukraine and like women making bombs in Ukraine and and young men carrying their rifles in Ukraine and praising them as Heroes post very similar pictures of Palestinians um and calling them terrorists it's glaring the double standard I don't even need to linger on it well the double standard is glaring but I also think the glorification of violence is questionable there's a balance to be struck of course but yeah I mean I don't what I don't I don't think I don't think we should be glorifying violence um at all but I don't think we should be normalizing violence either uh I think that's that's that's what it is you know I'll tell you a story I was interviewing a person whose brother was killed by the Israeli military during uh Israeli raid on their Village and the person was so concerned about whether I was gonna report that her brother allegedly had a Molotov cocktail in his hand and I found it absolutely insane absolutely absurd that we can just glance over the fact that there is again a foreign military in tanks with rifles and snipers invading The Village at 4am in the morning shooting live ammunition at people's houses throwing tear gas that we can just glance over it's normal we could just report on it no problem nobody's gonna abandon eyebrow but the fact that potentially somebody might have picked up a Molotov cocktail to throw it at this invading Army is where we draw the line it says a lot it says a lot about whose violence is normalized is accepted is institutionalized is glorified event right yeah and you walk around Tel Aviv and you see all of the plaques plastered around then around the streets of the country of the city celebrating the battles that they had won the massacres that they had enacted against the Palestinian people but God forbid God forbid Palestinians have any kind of similar sentiment so on July 4th during this intense period a Palestinian rammed a car into pedestrians at a bus stop in Tel Aviv injuring eight people before being shot dead by a passerby also that night Hamas fire rock is into Israel and then Israel responded with strikes on what it said was an underground weapon site so just to give some context to the intensives violence happening here what do you think about Hamas firing Rockets into Israel well it's the framing makes it seem as though like unprovoked Hamas is like firing Rockets onto Israel regards to what I think of Hamas obviously but unprovoked but that's not the case the propagation is the fact that they are forced to live in a cage that they have no access to clean water they have no access to basic rights no access to uh Imports no access to anything that they can't leave they're living in a densely populated Enclave that was deemed uninhabitable by the U.N that was deemed an open air prison um so the rockets in any case are retaliation for the seeds let's start there but again this is just to prove my point violence begets violence Palestinian people are not violent people we are not violent people at the core and I think you know what serves this narrative is islamophobia is like xenophobia towards Arabs which we don't have like I don't have the luxury you know to like to write laws about um by the way I'm I'm quite I'm quite you know frustrated by this uh I am I am preoccupied and the Palestinian people are preoccupied um with the material violence that we have to deal with on the day-to-day the demolitions the bombings uh the imprisonment that's what we're distracted with and and busy with that we can't even talk about the racism um The Casual racism against its anti-palestinian racism in the media on social media and diplomatic circles and but all of this all of this racism that has gone unchecked has not been regulated um for decades allows for these tropes to continue in which Palestinians are promoted as these like barbaric terrorists and the only way we could remedy uh that situation is to is by marketing them as these like defenseless victims but the fact of the matter is is is not this simplistic Palestinian people are human beings who should enjoy a full spectrum of humanity which in includes raids which includes uh the sustain which includes happiness and joy and laughter which includes celebration which includes um all of these things but we're not allowed this but we are doing exactly what any people throughout history who have been oppressed who have been colonized who have been occupied have done and continue to do as we see in Ukraine which is celebrated by mainstream media I'm sorry to uh keep reiterating this point but you know at this point uh I am quite you know exhausted by how exceptional Palestine and Palestinian resistance is when the world tells me time and time again that it doesn't have a problem with violence it just has a problem with who does that violence do you in your mind in in the way you see this region uh draw a distinction between the people in power versus the regular people so you mentioned the Palestinian people is there something you can comment on on Hamas and the PLO do you see them as fundamentally different from the people uh what does Hamas do well where did they fall short I think governments uh wherever globally any or different from people no government is a true reflection of its people I think uh you know this is even true in the case of like Arab countries that normalize with Israel in many of the cases there are um unelected governments I think the Palestinian Authority continues to fail I think there are subcontractors the Israeli regime through their security coordination and also I'd like to use this as an opportunity to comment a little bit on the on the analogy thing not to like stray away from the question but you know um the Palestinian Authority two years ago killed an opposition activist named nizarbanat it was a horrendous crime and I was in Ramallah with the people protesting against the Palestinian Authority and at some point they had their batons the position Authority police and they beat us with it and many of the people on the crowd were liking the Palestinian Authority to Zionism I think people this is what people do we when they are confronted by a great evil they liken it to some other great evil and this is where the Hitler analogy came from um again I don't think it's like the best strategy moving forward but I refuse you know to be uh you know criminalized for a little sentence but to linger on those in power so one of the criticisms towards Hamas and PLO towards the Israeli government at least the current coalition government is um that there's a lot of incentive to sort of perpetuate violence to maintain power there's a hunger for power and and maintaining that power amongst the powerful that's the way power works so is there um a worry you have about uh those in power not having the best interests of its people so those empower the PLO Hamas not uh not being incentivized towards peace towards Justice you know looking at the PA's action today it tells you a great deal about what they're interested in and what they're not interested in and maybe yeah the occupation is in their best interest um and you can infer similar things looking at at Hamas but the two the two these two entities virtually have no power even Hamas um Yani there is you know the the context that Hamas is permitted through by international law uh to use armed resistance blah blah blah does that mean Hamas is like equipped to govern Jose I don't think so does that mean that uh people around Palestine necessarily want to want to live under uh Hamas rule in 2006 Hamas was democratically elected I don't know if that's still the case today um there is there's a lot to be said but neither of these entities have any real power um in in perpetuating they don't the the only the only body that has access that can flip the switch and all of this equation is Israelis you know they're the ones who are keeping people in a case they're the ones who are um wrapping the West Bank with a with a wall um everything else to me is just secondary regardless of what I think personally of any of those people I know personally for me I I the world I Envision not just policy in the world they Envision is a world that goes beyond States that goes beyond this uh uh framing of power this this hierarchy in which uh some people will over other people this whole idea of nation-states be it Israel or any other nation states it's it's it's futile it's not good it's exclusive I think that we can achieve a better world than that well the you know how do you do a better world they actually if you just Linger on that like what the politically speaking geopolitically you have to have representation of the people you have to have laws you have to have leaders in governing bodies that enact those laws and all those kinds of things you probably need to have militaries to protect the people can you not imagine a world without militaries I can imagine it but we're not in that world yeah I'm not saying you know I have all the answers or a PowerPoint in my pocket you know with the instructions but I I'm saying the world I'd like to live in is one that transcends borders is one that you know does not necessitate militaries that doesn't necessitate all of these um prisons of these walls all of these racist laws so you don't think violence is a fundamental part of human nature that emerges and uh combined with the hunger for power I do think I do think that both of these things are like truly intrinsic to to human beings they also do think there is a way to move Beyond them I'm not saying I have the answers um I'm tempted Safeway but but you have a hope that there doesn't have to be War yeah yeah in the world definitely definitely well if we look a little bit more short term people speak about a one-state solution a two-state solution what is your hope here for
