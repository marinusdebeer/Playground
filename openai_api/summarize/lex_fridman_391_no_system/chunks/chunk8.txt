this is a commentary on like our natural reactions to tragedies right in like 2012 2011 something like this we have like a protest and um after the protest all of the women of the neighborhood were sitting down under the the Fig Tree of our neighborhood which they always do and you know a bunch of soldiers maybe 40 soldiers started marching down this the street and everybody dispersed and hidden their homes but my aunt who has now passed away my aunt refused to go home she wanted to to gather her teacups because she really cared about her teacups um so I was begging her to go inside and she refused she was getting her tea cup so a soldier a soldier you know uh grabbed me and squeezed me between his baton and an electricity pole and it was very excruciatingly painful and traumatizing for me as a child but it was it's also like a funny memory in in a way despite the pain despite the the trauma that came with it it was it's there's still something funny about it the absurdity of it yeah and it's like it's dignifying to find humor in these kinds of things it makes you realize you are not so weak you are not so powerless another thing is you know my same on too is like super obsessed with cleanliness would um you know insist on not going to sleep before washing the dishes and I would always sit there and say what you're just gonna like you're gonna give them the house clean like you can leave it dirty so they have to clean it up and these little things although like incredibly you know absurd and um telling of a harrowing reality that our family and many in the neighborhood were living are also the coping um mechanisms that we were using to to deal with our everyday uh reality and so much in the public framing of Palestinians be it in media and novels and diplomacy and so on and so forth is that of the powerless victim is that of the person who only weeps you know like Israeli propagandists for example um will like show pictures on Twitter of like a a house in Russia and they'll be like look this house has Windows like they're talking about their BC's but they have a nice they have a balcony on their house what are they talking about like you know or like they'll show a video of a supermarket like how come they're talking about a blockade when they have a supermarket and blah blah as though you know the ceiling has been so lowered that we can't even afford Joy anymore or you know a little supermarket in the neighborhood so as a poet as a writer I've written a book of poetry now working a new book what can you say about your process of crafting words I think people listening to this can can hear that there's a poetry the way you speak in English so somebody that cares about the craftsmanship of words in both English and Arabic what can you say about your process uh it's a lot more neat than like this conversation it's like I am obsessed with with sentences and it takes me a long time to like finish a piece of writing I'm I I'm a perfectionist do you edit a lot I edit all the time and I like can't move on from one sentence until it's perfect but I will say my other writer friends here in New York do not face is how easily disrupted my writing is by other news any all picture stories in my editor about something for example and then as I'm writing it 20 minutes and some kid was shot and killed by the Israeli military so you have to say something about it and then 30 minutes later as I'm writing it there's news about a home demolition in silhouette and there is this Relentless um onslaught of news that prevents us and depresses of the ability to analyze to frame to think to conceptualize to you know to write beyond the current affairs were stuck in this in the relentlessness of the occupation that a lot of the time I worry that the the things I'm writing are always in reaction to a crime that took place to a a bombing that took place and so on and so forth and I think that's unfortunately true for so many Palestinian writers so you know I would say isolation and like stepping away from the news is very important um to do but I don't do it so okay so the the struggled to find the time that the Timeless message in it is uh an ongoing struggle for you I mean there is there is the the Timeless you know it's not even timelessness it's Timeless I think what what you're right is always timely because the occupation is ongoing but the struggle is you know moving beyond the news and tackling more nuances um because my in Arabic I can in Arabic I can philosophy as I can talk about violence then I can talk about my complicated relationship with violence or like my complicated I can complicate and nuance and give things Nuance but in English people still do not believe we are under occupation even though it is an internationally recognized fact that is broadcasted 24 7 to the world's most watched screens so we're stuck in like a practice of providing facts and figure as in actually this happened and and this person did this and and according to international law and blah blah blah so we're stuck in this because the basic truths about our own existence are denied that we don't even have the luxury of you know evolving or rating Beyond it or at least evolving my writing Beyond it and this is what I'm trying to do with this notebook it does fascinating that in English you're uh your brain is more inclined to be to go towards activism or as in Arabic you have the luxury to be more a philosopher I wouldn't say activism I would say journalism like just uh just making sure you know like disrupting the flow of the sentence to insert a statistic or insert a historical fact that should be employed yeah and should be a household name but it's not um you know I can't just say that Akbar I have to say the nakaba the 1948 total near total Destruction of fasting Society at the hands of Zionist militias that leader formed the Israeli military that now terrorizes us today and there's like and there's like three tier legal system blah blah you I can just say knock about you have to give all of these explanations and that's that's heartbreaking and people ought to do better people are ought to you know do better this is not it's not it's not what my uh literature should be limited to it's not what anybody's literature should be going to do it's the job of it's the job of you know news reporters to reward the news but a lot of the time they use looted language they use passive voice they offer skate facts and it's on the shoulders of us the heavy carrying would you say the depressing in in the United States does a good or poor job of covering Israel and Palestine terrible job horrible job what's up they don't do their job whatsoever what are the biggest failings not mentioning that a town is occupied when you're reporting about an occupied Town not mentioning that a settlement is illegal or a settler is illegally present you know Palestinian Village when you're reporting on them only quoting um Israeli officials and only quoting Israeli Protestants and police officers and framing your entire analysis with Israeli officials and only interviewing Palestinians when they have um been brutalized and victimized physically yeah those are some of the issues there's there is plenty and then like saying things you know like is Israel will um Israel will bomb a hospital in Gaza and the Press will say like Hamas run hospital and this negative association with Hamas will remove any sympathy from the reader towards the victims of this Hospital bombing um a lot of things that a lot of a lot of them are Sinister I have many friends many journalists friends and I've seen many journalists online speak about their experiences when talking about Palestine the censorship that goes on into it um and you have many journalist friends some at the New York Times some um they used to be at Washington Post who tell me the kinds of battles they had to do they had to go through with their editors to let them even utter the word Palestine and not even on in like news pieces like pieces about let's say a Palestinian artist or a Palestinian Chef or whatever you know there's lots of there's there's a lot that happens behind the scene that is not reported on um because when it comes to Palestine the the rules and the laws of Journalism are bendable you know passive voice is King emitting facts is acceptable Anything Goes so you personally just psychologically what would have been the lowest points in your life the darkest points a recent study came out and said that 52 percent of Palestinians have depression I would argue that the number is much much higher I think it would be absurd um for someone to live under the conditions we live under and not contemplate many things many things not just suicide but many many many things and if and if people were to put themselves in our shoes for just one day they would understand um where all of the raids and all the resistance is coming from um it's not an easy life so where do you find the strength I'm I'm surrounded by good people and I'm I I'm starting to make with people and I don't even think of it as a strength I think that this is my obligation it just feels like the thing I have to do it's not I don't need inspiration I don't need strength I don't need it's it's just my obligation it's just there is a great travesty taking place in the world um and I and few others have been put in a place where we're able to talk about it to a few more people and it's just my obligation I have to do it what gives you hope about the future of Palestine what gives me hope about what the future of Boston is taking a look at history and understanding the across history there has not been an injustice that lingered um endlessly you know everything comes on to an end it's not necessarily there's not necessarily like a perfect resolution for everything but nothing nothing continues and it's and it's in the form that it started in and the occupation and colonialism and Palestine and Zionism all of these things are not at all sustainable whatsoever um so taking a look at history you know a lot of a lot of what I'm saying um today and what I have said in your podcast many people would have would be you know Pro clutching hearing me say what I say but I always try to remind myself of that during Jim Crow during slavery during the Holocaust um during the occupation of Algeria during any point of colonialism in the African continent um people did not possess the moral Clarity they possessed today when they talk about these things and all of these things were contested and controversial and in many many cases legal and today they are deplorable condemnable and people say never again and they don't remember them so that's what gives me hope is believing in the you know and believing in the inevitability of Justice what do you love most about Palestine what are like maybe little things that you remember from your childhood from your life there in each Jerusalem and elsewhere they you just brings a smile to your face I think this is the unabashedness uh uh of Palestinians um where people who are told and were at some point were told by the large majority of the world that we should shrink ourselves that we should be ashamed of who we are that we are monsters that we are terrorists that we are blah blah and Palestinian people don't really give a [ __ ] you know they're continuing to live as they do they continue to resist they continue to write they continue to to do to do all that they do and they love them the most and they love our ability to laugh more than anything else uh one thing is that's under misunderstood in America in American culture about Palestinian culture or just Western culture in there is like martyrdom culture a lot of the time people um will will you know broadcast images of Palestinian women cheering when their sons have been killed by um the Israeli forces and they'll say you know these people glorify death and these people are eager to like have sex with 70 virgins in heaven and so on and so forth but that's not the case the whole idea of the occupation when they are killing our children the whole idea is that they are trying to break our Spirits so these mothers
