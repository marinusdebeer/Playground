over the injustices perpetuated against Palestinians be it you know legalizing and upholding the withholding of slain Palestinian bodies who were killed by the Israeli military to be used as bargaining trips with Israeli militaries be it making decisions to dispossess entire Villages like be it never once uh you know granting release to any Palestinian who was held in administrative detention without charge or trial be it upholding the legality of the family reunification law that does not allow Palestinian couples who hold different legal statuses of reuniting and living together as families I mean those are just some of the few things I can think of about the Israeli Supreme Court so they're like the real the the real tension that exists is the lack of diversity on the Israeli political spectrum that makes the vision for a future so limited because those on what seems to be like the the far left um are defending and are defending an extremely conservative um institution that is a supreme court that they record as Progressive when in fact it is the opposite uh of such so what what do we do how can we how can we talk how can we have peace with with people who who are chanting to save you know the very body that is displacing us you know it's it's ridiculous what's your vision let's just take it as a microcosm of Jerusalem what's your vision for Jerusalem looks like with a peaceful coexistence of people you know as it looked like before before the Israeli State emerged I mean we should be reading our history here um when you read like European and white um historians they'll tell you like Palestine was Barren many of them would say like it was even without a people there were nobody nobody was there or like some of them will say we were uncivilized but the fact of the matter is Palestine Jerusalem particularly had a diversity of religion um druze Jewish people you know my grandmother continues to talk about well she continued until she died she continued to talk about her Jewish Neighbors when she grew up in the old city or like when she was born in the old city and then her Jewish neighbors um in Haifa we even had one Jewish member of our family M Sammy actually um who just also recently passed away their like Jews were a part of Palestine and they spoke Hebrew a different kind of Hebrew with this book Hebrew and they were people really need to read the Hundred Years War on Palestine it's it's really an excellent synopsis of the history but this whole idea that this is like some kind of war between two religions is so misleading because what's happening is a bunch of frankly European settlers with a certain political secular ideology came and relocated here and turned it into a religious conflict between people who have lived harmoniously together for decades before that and you know the whole idea be it like you know Christian Zionism or you know John Hagee or like the calls for Jews to leave the United States and relocate in in Israel or like you know uh recently which we've heard about a long time ago um but recently an Israeli historian confirmed uh uh the fact that Israeli organizations were bombing Baghdad and bombing synagogues in Iraq to get Iraqi Jews to leave and come relocate in Israel right all of this is manufactured and again none of this is a conspiracy theory I know it sounds absurd and and you know anytime I like look at my my life from a bird's eye view I think what a circus but it's but it's real and it's it's verifiable Yanni call the fact suckers you mentioned the land registry can you can you elaborate what's happening there yeah yeah absolutely so um our small victory in the Israeli courts um was that they would keep us in our homes until a land registry is completed basically it means that they have to check who owned the land prior um and then they could decide if or if the land is ours or the land belongs to the Israeli um seller organizations that are headquartered in the United States and enjoy a tax exempt status here um and that sounds great on the surface but then you look at Israeli law you look at Israeli courts you look at ownership and you see that oh Israelis refuse to authenticate or take into consideration any land ownership documents from the prior of the establishment of the state so all of us in Jerusalem who have their taboo papers their ownership papers from the ottoman era that's not legit in the eyes of the Israeli court because that existed before like your ownership Deeds existed long before Israel even existed so we're not going to take this into consideration so not to be cynical here but unfortunately the the likely result of the land registry is that they're going to say oh all of this land belongs to these Jewish organizations because they're not going to take any of our documents into consideration but that means that there's going to be another campaign and there's going to be a long-winded fight and we'll see what happens but that's that's the fear and there's there's a huge Dreadful fear of a massive loss in property in Jerusalem following this land registry for the reasons I just told you it's the mere fact that they just refuse to look at land ownership documents what is the process of the fighting this in the course look like if you can maybe just comment on it so there's I always make a joke without being in an Israeli court is like playing a game of broken uh broken telephone because you know everybody's speaking in Hebrew and then like your lawyer says something to your dad and your dad says something to your mom and your mom Whispers it in your ear and then you're like you say it to your cousin your cousin has like a completely different idea of the verdict than what the verdict is but that's really the reality so a lot of the fights happen family by family no it's like groups so like if in our case it's like four houses every four houses um but again it happens in a language we do not speak and a lot of the time our strategy is buying time and you know building a Global campaign like we have we know that there is no recourse in um in the Israeli courts I mean My grandmother used to say and this is like a popular proverb if you're if your enemy is the judge to whom do you complain so the to the whom you you complain is maybe the International Community yeah I mean in our case in our case it was the International Community but in our case also it wasn't just the International Community it was like the hundreds of thousands of people in Palestine and abroad who are marching on the streets getting beaten and brutalized in Jerusalem and I don't know sometimes arrested in places like Germany and and so on and so forth um who who forced themselves inside the media cycle this was what was unique about we were able to penetrate an industry that usually ignores us and usually refuses to use any of our framing any of our quotations and these people that March these people that spread the rhetoric um spread the facts wrote articles these people that made videos online and and got arrested and many of whom are still in Israeli prisons paying higher prices than I have ever paid these people are the ones that truly moved the International Community into action it wouldn't have you know the United States I don't think would have said anything had it not been for the immense media pressure that was created from the immense popular pressure there are a lot of moving parts to a global campaign and I think it's so impressive you know that we were able to do this without any media backing without any institutional backing without any training without without any budget nothing you mentioned the United States uh what's the role of the United States in the struggle that you've been describing what's the positive what's the negative the role is perpetuating what's happening honey it's all a negative role to be honest with the money with power yeah it's like the 3.8 billion in military aid every year it's the standing ovation Israel is the largest recipient of U.S foreign AIDS since World War II to date United States has provided Israel 150 billion dollars as you said is providing currently 3.8 billion every year um that a lot of people raised the question of what's the interest of tax paying American citizens in this kind of yeah zero interest foreign aid what's your interest I don't think Americans I think Americans a lot of Americans are concerned with health care a lot of Americans are concerned with clean water in Flint I don't think they are concerned with funding apartheid in another country and I think it's a disturbing phenomenon that although public opinion in the United States is Shifting I would argue drastically about Palestine people in Washington are yet to catch up it was only I think nine Congress people who boycotted herzog's speech um in Congress yesterday and he received Standing Ovation after Standing Ovation after Standing Ovation after sending Ovation and I wonder um if the everyday American is concerned that many of their politicians are Israel first politicians are politicians who care more about maintaining a relationship with the Israeli regime that they care about their own districts you've tweeted that 49 years ago gassan kind of funny you can maybe correct me on the pronunciation was assassinated you wrote quote his revolutionary articulations of the Palestinian plight for Liberation shook the colonial regime yet he's not dead his ideas remain ever timely and teachable and he also tweeted an excerpt from his writing between 1936 and 1939 the Palestinian revolutionary movement suffered a severe setback at the hands of three separate enemies that were to constitute together the principal threat to the Nationalist movement in Palestine in all subsequent stages of its struggle won the local reactionary leadership to the regimes in the Arab states surrounding Palestine and three the imperialist Zionist enemy can you analyze what he means by those three things the local reactionary leadership the regimes in the Arab states surrounding Palestine and the Imperial Zionist enemy and also could you comment on him as a person yeah I mean what's the kind of funny is a brilliant uh brilliant brilliant writer and uh he was prolific he's authored so much books even though he was assassinated in the 70s but you know he was 37 if I'm not mistaken 35 when he was assassinated you know he was an inspiration to me in in school and I remember like even even my teachers had qualms about him because he was like a secular person but I I loved Austin he has a beloved figure in the Palestinian community and I hope to one day be able to like Shiva fraction um of what he's achieved in the terms of like shaping a political Consciousness for Palestinians and four people in the region did he classify himself as a as a politician as a philosopher as an activist uh do you know he was a writer but he was also part of the Palestine uh personal in Liberation Front pflp so he used the words to fight Freedom yeah I don't think he would would have would have thought his words were divorced from other forms of struggle but I think he recognized the importance of culture uh and shaping culture and shaping public opinion um both in achieving uh you know a shift in global stance and also in achieving you know an Awakening in the Palestinian generation as well you know there's a very famous uh famous interview of his where he's talking to uh I believe a British journalist and the British journalist is asking him why don't you why don't you have talks with the Israelis and he means what do you mean talks you mean capitulation you mean talking that you can't have a conversation between The Sword and the neck um and they think that that really summarizes the kind of you know values listed for now to talk about the three things local reactionary leadership regimes in the Arab states surrounding Palestine and the Imperial Zionist enemy yeah so in in today's terms the local reactionary leadership is the Palestinian Authority the regional regimes we're talking about you know actually you know the normalization deals that have emerged in recent years the abrahamic Accords have been talked about as though they're like groundbreaking new um phenomenon but many Arab countries have normalized relations with the Israeli regime um since the birth of the state it's not a new thing um but yes the only word he I think he was talking about Egypt and Jordan at the time today we can include United Arab Emirates we could include Bahrain we could include Morocco um and you know these again these abrahamic Accords they are promoted and marketed and talked about as some kind of like religious uh reconciliation which I think is the most disgusting thing ever because they're not about
