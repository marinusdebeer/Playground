Please provide a detailed summary of the following while keeping as much details in as possible: 
regardless of whatever was written in these books that were written thousands and thousands of years ago the fact of the matter is no one has a right to go on slaughtering people removing them from their homes and then continuing to live in their homes continuing to drink coffee on their balconies um decades and decades later with no shame with no introspection with no reflection that's no one has the right to do that no one has the right to keep an entire population of people in arcades which is what's happening to people in the West Bank who have no freedom of of movement which is what's happening in Gaza which is blockaded to water air and land and is deemed uninhabitable by human rights organizations like the UN no one has a right to do that the following is a conversation with Muhammad alcard a world-renowned Palestinian poet writer journalist and an influential voice speaking out and fighting for the Palestinian cause he provides a very different perspective on Israel and Palestine than my previous two episodes with Benjamin Netanyahu and Yuval Noah Harari I hope his story and his words add to your understanding of this part of the world as it did to mine I will continue to have difficult long-form conversations such as these always with empathy and humility but with backbone and please allow me to briefly comment about criticisms I receive of who I am as an interviewer and a human being I am not afraid to travel anywhere or challenge anyone face to face even if it puts my life in danger but I'm also not afraid to be vulnerable to truly listen to empathize to walk a mile on the well-worn shoes of those very different from me it's this latter task not the formal one that is truly the most challenging in conversations and in life but to me it is the only way this is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's Muhammad alcard tell me about Sheikh jarah the neighborhood in East Jerusalem where you grew up in a way a typical neighborhood despite the despite the Absurd reality the surrounds it it's a typical neighborhood in terms of Palestinian neighborhoods is one that is threatened with colonialism with settler expansion and with forced expulsion and it has been that way since the early 70s my family like all of the other families were expelled from their homes in the nakabe in 1948 and they were forced out by the hagana and other Zionist parallel militaries that later formed the Israeli military and they were driven to various cities and my grandmother moved from City to city and she ended up in 1956 Silverado has established as a refugee housing unit by the United Nations and by the Jordanian government which has which had control over that part of Jerusalem at the at the time and then people lived there harmoniously they were all from different parts of Palestine and you know they managed to rebuild their lives after the first explosion and then in the 70s you had cellular organizations um many of whom were registered here in New York and in the United States claiming our houses and our lands as their own by Divine decree and because obviously because the judges are Israeli and the Lords were written by Israeli settlers and the whole Judiciary was established uh atop the the rebel of our homes and villages we had no you know we had no real pull in the courts the Israeli courts would look at the Israeli documents which we argue are falsifies and fabricated um and they would take them at face value without authentication and they refused to look at our documents they refused to look at the documents from the Jordanian government the documents from the U.N the documents from the ottoman archives so you already have this kind of asymmetry in the court that for any person with common sense would lead you to believe that this is not in fact a legal battle um or a real estate dispute as the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs likes to frame it but rather a very very political battle one that is about social engineering one is about demographics one that is about removing as many Palestinians as possible from occupied Jerusalem so we did what all Palestinian families in Jerusalem do when they're faced with this kind of threat and we bought time we we pleaded and pleaded and appealed the courts and appealed the cases and we got over 50 expulsion orders in 2009 rifle wielding settlers accompanied by police and Israeli military came over and shoved our neighbors outside of their home around 5 a.m it's like it was the most brutal violent thing I'd seen as a child at the time and I didn't realize that my turn was coming my turn was next they threw they threw them out in the middle of the night with sound bombs and rubber bullets and they had to live in tents on the street for many many months and even lived in our front yards for a few months and lived in their cars can you look on that process 2009 you said 50 expulsion orders what uh what was happening between the 70s and 2009 there had been many dozens of expulsions orders against us and against many other families in the in the neighborhood 28 other family 20 28 families in total actually um and in 2008 2009 the first wave of explosions finally happened it actually began with uh on camera recorded we're not related but we live on the same street in the same neighborhood she was thrown out of her home her husband an elderly man also named was pronounced dead on the spot he had a stroke and died he they the Israeli soldiers pulled him out of his home while he was um urinating and threw him under the streets and he died a few months later the Ravi and the hanoon families which are you know kind of not a clan but you know in Palestine you have sometimes a building that contains multiple brothers and their wives um each have little apartments about 35 people were thrown out in the middle of the street right across from us and then by the end of 2009 I had come home from school to find all of my furniture scattered across the length of the street and I saw the settlers many of whom had American accents living in our house and their justification for this the reasoning for this is you know Divine decree this is this is what God wants this is the promised land this is so and so as if God is some kind of real estate agent um so they took over half of our home and we continue to be in courts for the following decade this was I was still a child and I had broken English and I was talking to all of these diplomats and all these journalists who would you know subjugate me um to their subject me to their you know racism and biases and and so on and so forth and he had to prove my Humanity time and time again and I had to you know do all of this all with broken English um and we were lucky even if we got a if we got a quote in the in the article written about us by the times or so on and so forth move forward to 2020 I was in New York City studying a master's degree getting a master's degree and my father calls me and he tells me you know we haven't yet another expulsion order and we decided to launch a campaign it was quite ambitious at the time but the whole objective of the campaign was to demystify what is happening right because it's reported on in the news it's reported on around the world as this real estate dispute as these evictions which was not really what's happening evictions do not entail a foreign army in an occupied territory forcibly removing you out of your home uh so I came home from New York and we launched a campaign which turned into a global success and I believe it was a global success because finally the the images on the screen matched the rhetoric that was being said it wasn't so confusing or complicated anymore all of this asymmetry was pronounced and articulated in a way that any of you or be it in Alabama be in New York be it in Egypt was able to understand the asymmetry of the digi of the judicial system and you know the agenda of colonialism that was taking place here and due to immense International and diplomatic processor um from all over the world even the United States the Israeli Supreme Court was forced to cancel all of the eviction orders until further notice this I consider was a small victory because obviously we are still at risk of losing our homes once they decide to do the land registry which we can get into a little bit later if you'd like um but nonetheless it was something that we haven't seen before and the fact that the Supreme Court canceled all of these dozens and dozens of past eviction orders it's set a precedent and it also proved that this was a political battle not a legal one so let's just add a little more detail to the people who are not familiar with the story with the region with the evictions with the courts so first of all shakes your eyes in East Jerusalem maybe you can say what is Jerusalem where is it located what are we talking about in terms of regionally and second what kind of people that live there so if you could talk about the Palestinian people and um we should also make clear that these evictions is literally people living in homes and their homes are taken away from them I suppose technically it's legal uh evictions but you're saying that there's a asymmetry of power in the courts where the legal is uh not so much legal but is politically and maybe even religiously based yeah I mean the biggest the most important context here is that oftentimes Americans think that Israel and Palestine are some kind of two neighbor two neighboring countries um that live next to each other and they are at War but the fact of the matter is Palestinian cities exist all over the country and it's just one country it's just one infrastructure and Israel is literally on top of Palestine it was established on top of our Villages um in the late 40s uh now according to international law the eastern part of Jerusalem is under occupation so Israeli presence ends with Dixon over the area is completely illegitimate they say the evictions are legal because the settlers write their laws so obviously they're going to allow settlements to expand but according to international law according to even U.S policy um Israel occupies the eastern part of Jerusalem it's jurisdiction there is illegitimate we shouldn't even be going to their courts in the first place but we have no other option um we're talking we're talking about how we're talking about Jerusalem we're talking about generations and generations and generations of people who have lived there for the longest time who now even though you know for example me I don't have a citizenship I'm a resident a mere resident I have a blue ID card even though my grandmother and my grandfather were born in Jerusalem their grandparents were born in Jerusalem um even though we've lived there for Generations but Palestinians in Jerusalem we are not Citizens We're just mere residents same thing with residents of the occupied Syrian Golan they are not citizens they are just residents in their own hometowns this is an important uh piece but all of this gets convoluted and Lost in Translation and I think I I would argue it's a lot more it's a lot of the time it's dubious it's it's malicious the fact that these little pieces of context that frame the entire story get lost you know I'll talk to you about something else um just 10 minutes 10 minutes across from my neighborhood there's another another neighborhood called silhouette and the people in Silvan are also threatened with expulsion but not through evictions but through home demolitions and if you look at American state American Media or Israeli State media you would read the headlines you know Palestinians living in homes built illegally are gonna face you know their homes as they're going to be torn apart what these headlines don't tell you and even sometimes most of the time the substance doesn't tell you that Palestinians seldom ever get building permit applications um in fact recently a spokesperson for the Israeli military confirmed that was 95 of building permits applications submitted by Palestinians and is Jerusalem and the West Bank are rejected by the Israeli authorities and to make this even more absurd the guy the councilman who is responsible um for rejecting and accepting building permit applications his name is Jonathan Youssef and he's a he's a an activist in the settler movements and he's a Jerusalem council member and he last week following the expulsion of uh a sublaban family in the old city of Jerusalem he
