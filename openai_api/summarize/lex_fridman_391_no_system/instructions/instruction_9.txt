Please provide a detailed (keep as much detail as possible) summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
In the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, the speaker emphasizes the moral wrongness of killing and displacing people and living in their homes. They highlight the lack of freedom of movement for Palestinians in the West Bank and the blockade on Gaza, which have been criticized by human rights organizations. To provide a unique perspective, the speaker introduces Muhammad alcard, a prominent Palestinian poet, writer, journalist, and advocate who grew up in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem. Sheikh Jarrah has faced threats of colonialism, settler expansion, and forced expulsion since the 1970s.  The speaker explains that alcard's family was expelled from their homes by Israeli military forces in 1948 during the nakba, which refers to the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians in the establishment of the state of Israel. From the 1970s onwards, settler organizations registered in the US started claiming Palestinian homes and lands in Sheikh Jarrah using Israeli courts to justify their claims. The speaker criticizes the Israeli judicial system for its bias and reliance on falsified Israeli documents while disregarding Jordanian government or UN documents.  The alcard family has made repeated appeals against eviction orders and highlights a brutal expulsion in 2009 where armed settlers, accompanied by police and the Israeli military, forcibly expelled alcard's neighbors from their homes, resulting in the death of an elderly man. In 2020, alcard and his family launched a campaign to expose the reality of Sheikh Jarrah, gaining global attention and temporarily halting all eviction orders.  The speaker provides background information on Jerusalem, emphasizing the coexistence of Palestinian and Israeli communities but highlighting the illegitimacy of Israeli jurisdiction over the eastern part of the city based on international law. Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are considered residents rather than citizens. The speaker also mentions Silwan, another neighborhood facing threats of home demolitions due to the denial of building permits by Israeli authorities.  The speaker calls for recognition, redistribution, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees as necessary steps for peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. They criticize the negative role of the United States in perpetuating the conflict through military aid and political support to Israel. The speaker believes in the power of literature, culture, and changing public opinion to affect policy and bring about material change.  They acknowledge the influence of historical figures like Ghassan Kanafani in shaping Palestinian consciousness and discuss the role of the Palestinian Authority and Arab regimes surrounding Palestine. The speaker believes in the potential for change in the United States, given its influence and leverage, and emphasizes the importance of political education and unity among Palestinians in the diaspora.  The speaker mentions their memoir titled "A Million States and One," documenting their experiences and the two waves of expulsion in 2009 and 2020-2021. They aim to emphasize dignity and reject the notion of polite suffering, instead leaning into the humor and irony of their experiences to bring about a different narrative. The speaker believes that humor can be a powerful tool in resisting and challenging the status quo.
