Please provide a detailed (keep as much detail as possible) summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
The speaker begins by discussing the irrelevance of ancient books in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, emphasizing that the killing and displacement of people, followed by living in their homes, is morally wrong. They bring attention to the lack of freedom of movement for Palestinians in the West Bank and the blockade on Gaza, both of which have been criticized by human rights organizations.   The speaker introduces Muhammad alcard, a prominent Palestinian poet, writer, journalist, and advocate for the Palestinian cause, who offers a unique perspective on the Israel-Palestine conflict. The aim is to enhance the audience's understanding of the situation. They then delve into Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem where alcard grew up. The neighborhood has faced threats of colonialism, settler expansion, and forced expulsion since the 1970s.   The speaker explains that alcard's family, like many others, were expelled from their homes by Israeli military forces in 1948 during the nakba (catastrophe). Alcard's grandmother eventually settled in a refugee housing unit established by the UN and the Jordanian government. From the 1970s onwards, settler organizations registered in the US started claiming Palestinian homes and lands in Sheikh Jarrah as their own, using Israeli courts to justify their claims. The speaker criticizes the Israeli judicial system for its bias and reliance on falsified Israeli documents while disregarding Jordanian government or UN documents.   The speaker recounts the family's repeated appeals against eviction orders but highlights the brutal expulsion that occurred in 2009, when armed settlers accompanied by police and the Israeli military forcibly expelled alcard's neighbors from their homes, scattering their furniture across the street. They emphasize that these actions are not mere evictions but part of a political battle to remove Palestinians from occupied Jerusalem. The speaker also mentions an incident where an elderly man died after being forcefully removed from his home while urinating.   In 2020, alcard and his family launched a campaign to expose the reality of what was happening in Sheikh Jarrah, aiming to counter the media's portrayal of the situation as a real estate dispute rather than a political battle for social engineering and demographic change. The campaign gained global attention and temporarily halted all eviction orders, but the family remains at risk of losing their homes in the future.   The speaker provides background information on Jerusalem, highlighting its coexistence of Palestinian and Israeli communities, but emphasizes the illegitimacy of Israeli jurisdiction over the eastern part of the city based on international law. Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are considered residents rather than citizens, despite their long presence in the city. Additionally, the speaker mentions Silwan, another neighborhood where Palestinians face threats of home demolitions due to the denial of building permits by Israeli authorities.   Overall, the speaker presents alcard's perspective on Sheikh Jarrah and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict, emphasizing the power asymmetry, political motivations, and human rights violations occurring in the region.

house we're not going to be sought and we're supposed to not do anything about it that is absurd any any person watching this understands this completely people understand you know people understand that if somebody is attacking your home you'll fight back if somebody is attacking your family you fight back that is that is not but again who gets to call who a terrorist who gets to Define terrorism this is all about who has power who gets to write these laws who gets to write these definitions you know why is it um why is it that American accents and Iraq is not called terrorism by American politicians wise you know violence is like this mutating mutating Concepts you know and it takes on many shapes and forms and if it's in in a uniform it's if it speaks in English if it has blonde hair it's somehow acceptable it's okay we make movies about it you know we sell out tickets about it we make games about it but if it's without a uniform it's if it has a thick accent if it has a beard you know that's that's condemnable that's wrong that's terrorism you know do you think violence is an effective method of protest and resistance in general in general I think it has been but I think you know I believe in fighting on all fronts I don't think violence alone is gonna bring about change I think uh there's so much to do uh in culture and shifting public opinion there's so much to do in media and fighting back against media eraser and census and censorship there's so much to do diplomatically and politically um um and I I think I would be naive if I don't take the power imbalance into consideration um one side has makeshift weapons and the other side is one of the most sophisticated armies in the world so I don't know I don't know how effective violence could be in this case but if you look at the flip side do you see the power of non-violent resistance so Martin Luther King Gandhi the power of attorney the other cheek he spoke negatively about turning the other cheek so I sense that uh doing so has not been effective for the Palestinian people we've turned the other cheek uh generation after generation there is this Zionist Trope that that is used against us they say Palestinian rejectionism they say that we reject everything but if you look at the history like our leadership the Palestinian Authority has given up ins after ends has compromised on acre after acre has signed deal after deal after deal after deal and still there is no peace so turning the other cheek is not you know the most effective method in my book what are the top obstacles to Peaceful coexistence of Israelis and Palestinians the the occupation comes to mind the strictical policies come to mind the seeds comes to mind the asymmetry of the Judiciary comes to mind the whole the whole system needs to be dismantled I will quote my dear friend who's uh who's a lawyer who says you know the solution Justice comes about through recognition return and redistribution there are millions of Palestinian refugees who are living in excruciating circumstances and refugee camps around the world there are thousands of Palestinian prisoners um who are held in prisons for defending their homes hundreds of which are held without charge or trial by the way there are many Palestinians who get killed in broad daylight with no recourse journalists and Medics and everyday people not just the fire the Freedom Fighters um we need again recognition return and redistribution and peace comes about when when when they stop killing us when they stop keeping us in a cage I mean that's that's quite simple can you describe recognition redistribution return and redistribution return return right of return right the right of return to all of the Palestinian refugees to their homes you know when I'm driving around haifan I see my grandmother is uh home that's now turned into a restaurant you know I could have you know I I made a joke in one of my essays recently that had I had that I could have had it all you know beats front views her smug attitude you know she grew up by the she grew up by the Sea after she relocated the High phones after you know Jerusalem um we want that we want that and um you know they're lucky I don't want netanyahu's home but I just want my home I just want my home we want to return I also wouldn't there needs you know and like I believe in the 1960s the Israeli government classified 90 of all of historic Palestine as state-owned land this is all land that was owned by Palestinian farmers who have cultivated their lands for decades you know since the establishment of the Israeli State there has been uh Jewish only towns popping up every few years and not one town not one Palestinian town has emerged we are even those of us who have Israeli Israeli citizenship who live outside of the wall are encircled and cannot have their natural Community growth in their towns that needs to change that needs to change you mentioned the wall can you describe the wall the wall is a nine meter high cement wall uh that was finished in 2003 and if you're American you've probably heard the whitewash sanitized version of the name which is the security wall but it's uh it's the wall that literally has stolen thousands of Dunhams of land and has ripped apart Families my mother is a poet or was a poet at some point and she had this poems she she published in the paper Called Love behind the wall and it describes you know it's it's a poem but it describes a real life situation of uh two families that who lived right across the street from each other but were then separated by the wall and they would fly balloons um you know to see each other from each side of the wall or something like that this although it sounds absurd but it's the reality for many Palestinian families whose lives were torn apart to his livelihoods also were torn apart uh by the wall maybe this is a good opportunity to talk about the the legal classifications for Palestinians you know um Israel much like any other Colonial entity was has Divine has divided and fragmented the Palestinian people um as I said earlier I have a blue ID which means I'm a resident a friend of mine who lives in heifa for example two hours away from me 150 kilometers not nothing too bad in this country has and Israeli citizenship he can you know travel he can enter the West Bank he can um do a lot more he's a citizen he can vote if he wants to not that we want to um you know I always tease my friends or you can go to Italy without without a Visa because you have an Israeli citizenship but you know they battle National and race or they battle um crime in their own communities because of police negligence they they battle land conference land confiscation and have battled confiscations in the 50s whereas somebody with a green ID somebody from the West Bank cannot leave the West Bank cannot go anywhere without a special permit and lives Behind These Walls and even within the West Bank the West Bank I think hilariously George Bush described it as Swiss cheese because of the holes every every few every 100 meters there's a new settlement or there's a new military checkpoint so even if you live behind the wall in the West Bank with your green ID even though you're raw you're robbed of your right to movement you still even can't move from town to town within the West Bank without encountering subtler violence or military violence while you're crossing the checkpoints and so on and so forth and then the last category we have is people who live in Russia we were talking about over 2 million people who live in an open air prison um who have no right to movement but also have no access to clean water water and no access to supplies no access to good food no access to Good Health Care and so on and so forth who routinely get bombarded every few years um is like two hours away from my house it feels like an absolute far away planet because it's so isolated from the rest of the country so imagine all of these different legal statuses fragmenting um your everyday identity and creating different challenges and obstacles for you to deal with for each group to deal with you know it's amazing and impressive that despite these Colonial barriers the the real cement ones and the you know the barriers in the mind despite all of these barriers the Palestinian people have made have maintained their national identity for 70 years that is incredibly impressive and it also sends a message that as long as we have a boot on our neck we are going to continue fighting you know violence cracking down on refugee camps bombarding refugee camps is only going to bring about more violence so West Bank is a large region where a lot of Palestinian people live and then there are settlements sprinkled throughout and those settlements have walls around them for security cameras and security guards security guards almost a million sellers in the West Bank and so what are the different cities here if you can mention so the West Bank in the West Bank or mileage and in Bethlehem Hebron Jericho Annapolis they have their own stories they have their own histories yeah and it's fascinating also how interconnected they are you know like a friend of mine Mona Omari recently did a a documentary report on the day that Haifa fell during the Zionist Invasion the hagana um led the Palestinian residents of Haifa down to the city center and as absurd as it sounds those of them who stood on the right side of the street were forced into cars that took them to multiple stops that would later become multiple refugee camps the last of which was Janine refugee camp and um those who stood on the left side of the street were forced to board uh boats that took them to Lebanon to become refugee camps refugees there last month we saw the Israeli Army invade Janine in maybe the largest military invasion of Janine since 2002 um and they killed many people they attacked Medics and journalists in broad daylight on camera they have destroyed infrastructure and it was all very painful but I think the most compelling aspect of the real on Janine was what followed Israeli soldiers at night held their megaphones and uh instructed hundreds of Palestinians to flee their homes and they told them if you don't leave if you don't have your hand up in the air you will get shot and they were forced to leave their homes in the camp and walk so God knows where I can guarantee you because the nakaba is not that old I can guarantee you that some people who were marching away from their camps were chased away from their homes in the camp engineering were some of the same people who were chased away from the homes in Haifa in the first place this Perpetual exile that Palestinian people continue to live is is unbearable I mean in my case my grandmother was removed from her home in Haifa in 48 and then she moved from Sydney City and then in 2009 she saw half of her home taken over by Israeli soldiers my grandmother died in 2020 and two months later we got the next expulsion order from the Israeli Court I'm quite ashamed to admit that I was relieved my grandmother had died because I did not want her 102 years old at the time to go through yet another nakabe and this is the fact for so many Palestinians regardless of where they are on the map if I may read the description of the situation in Janine and maybe you can comment so this is on July 3rd 4th and 5th just reading Washington Post description so this was an Israeli military incursion to Janine The Raid included more than 1 000 soldiers backed by drone strikes making it Israel's largest such operation in the West Bank since the end of the second Palestinian Uprising in 2005 the Israeli military said it dismantled hundreds of explosive cleared hundreds of weapons destroyed underground hideouts and confiscated hundreds of thousands of dollars in quote Terror funds many of the 50 Palestinians who have attacked Israelis since the start of the year have come from Janine camp and the surrounding area Palestinian attacks inside Israel have killed 24 people this year U.N experts describe the genie in operation as collective punishment in quotes for the Palestinian people amounting to egregious violations of international law many of the more than 150 Palestinians killed by Israelis this year have also come from these communities Palestinian Fighters say they need arms to defend themselves against the Israeli occupation and Military incursions into the camp during which Palestinian civilians including children have been killed so those are the I would say different perspectives on the many people on
