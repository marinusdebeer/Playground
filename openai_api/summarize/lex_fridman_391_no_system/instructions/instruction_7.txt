Please provide a detailed (keep as much detail as possible) summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
In the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, the speaker discusses the moral wrongness of killing and displacing people and living in their homes. They highlight the lack of freedom of movement for Palestinians in the West Bank and the blockade on Gaza, both of which have been criticized by human rights organizations. To offer a unique perspective, the speaker introduces Muhammad alcard, a prominent Palestinian poet, writer, journalist, and advocate. The speaker explains that alcard grew up in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem facing threats of colonialism, settler expansion, and forced expulsion since the 1970s. Alcard's family was expelled from their homes by Israeli military forces in 1948 during the nakba. From the 1970s onwards, settler organizations registered in the US started claiming Palestinian homes and lands in Sheikh Jarrah, using Israeli courts to justify their claims. The speaker criticizes the Israeli judicial system for its bias and reliance on falsified Israeli documents while disregarding Jordanian government or UN documents. They recount the family's repeated appeals against eviction orders but highlight the brutal expulsion that occurred in 2009. Armed settlers, accompanied by police and the Israeli military, forcibly expelled alcard's neighbors from their homes, with one elderly man dying during the process. In 2020, alcard and his family launched a campaign to expose the reality of Sheikh Jarrah and gained global attention, temporarily halting all eviction orders. The speaker provides background information on Jerusalem, emphasizing the coexistence of Palestinian and Israeli communities but highlighting the illegitimacy of Israeli jurisdiction over the eastern part of the city based on international law. Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are considered residents rather than citizens. The speaker mentions Silwan, another neighborhood facing threats of home demolitions due to the denial of building permits by Israeli authorities. Overall, the speaker presents alcard's perspective on Sheikh Jarrah and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict, emphasizing power asymmetry, political motivations, and human rights violations. They call for recognition, redistribution, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees as necessary steps for peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. Additionally, the speaker criticizes the negative role of the United States in perpetuating the conflict through military aid and political support to Israel. They highlight the importance of global campaigns and pressure from the International Community to bring change. The speaker also discusses the role of historical figures like Ghassan Kanafani, acknowledging his writing and political work in shaping Palestinian consciousness. They explain that the local reactionary leadership refers to the Palestinian Authority, while the regimes in the Arab states surrounding Palestine includes countries that have normalized relations with Israel. These normalization deals are marketed as religious reconciliation but are criticized for disregarding Palestinian rights.

religious reconciliation they're about arms deals and economic deals and they're about you know consolidating power in the region they're about Mutual strategic interests that all of these nations have together and some people argue that you know Palestine is no longer an Arab cause because our Arab countries are normalizing but most of these governments if not all actually all these governments that have normalized most of them are monarchies um are not elected governments and they do not um represent the will of the people or the desires or the opinions of their peoples and the proof to this is like places like Jordan and Egypt even though they've normalized and had peace agreements with Israel for many many many years Palestine and the Palestinian cause was still a talking point in the political campaigning of politicians the Jordanian Egyptian politicians and continues to be um for them to gain popularity because that's where the hearts of the people are um and then you know the Zionist regime is quite explanatory the Imperial Zionist regime I mean what else do you call a regime that sought help from imperialist powers to depopulate an entire country and build a new one on top of it so mostly you say the thing that Abraham records achieved is a is a negative thing for Palestine so these kinds of agreements amongst the power about the uh between the leadership is not uh yeah it's not positive for for the region no no obviously they're going to be marketed as as positive and obviously another they're gonna have this flowery language surrounding them and and the idiots in the room might like nod and smile but anybody with critical thinking skills can know that if a people continue to be under occupation you know that's there's nothing positive there and it's also there's you know let's linger a little bit on the mutual interests the only way Morocco could normalize relations with the Israeli regime is so that the Israeli regime could recognize Moroccan sovereignty over in the western Sahara which just happened actually last week and now Morocco uh and before that Morocco recognized uh Sovereign Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank it's not like Morocco itself is just has no interest in this kind of uh deal you mentioned that uh you you hope of accomplishing uh some of the things that Hassan kind of finding was able to accomplish let me ask you a silly question perhaps a silly question do you have interest in running for political office in uh or in into leadership I hear laughter in the room um to lead in a leadership position in Palestine not not currently no not at all let's see if this ages well I don't think you know I I don't think there's there's a body through what's you know I can run for anything it's like they're completely dysfunctional and also you know I don't want to wear a suit all the time that's who would want to do that so from which kind of pedestal or from which kind of uh stage do you think you could be most effective you know I I speak I was born and raised in Jerusalem I speak perfect Arabic I think my my Arabic writing is much Superior to my English writing but I choose to um write in English because I think there's not there's a disparity and there's a Chasm between what is um said in Arabic on this in the street in Palestine and what is said here about Palestinians um both by anti-palestinian racists and people who are pro Palestine and advocates for Palestine and I believe I and a few others from my Generations or many others actually from my own generation are working to fill that Chasm and I also believe that literature culture the public sphere changing the public opinion changing the narrative is important to affecting policy to affecting change affecting material change you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna go read a poem in front of uh in front of a checkpoint in what's it cuts in Flames that's not I'm not I'm not that delusional about the power of words but I do think that I have a responsibility and I have a privileged even to have a voice to have some kind of platform and if I'm not you know defining myself if I'm not talking and representing myself then other people will Define me and their their definitions of the Palestinian people across the few past decades have not been coined or generous to the Palestinian people that's one thing the other thing is I believe in the United States as a as a front for change um I believe we have a lot more leverage here than we do back home um again I believe in in someone said the other day I can't I can't remember their name but someone said no stone unturned I believe in in fighting on all fronts but here really I can go I can go protest in front of the Israeli Embassy without getting shot um there's a lot there's a lot of work to be to be done here there's a lot of people um waking up I would even argue that a reckoning is coming um in the American public and more and more American people are concerned where their tax money is going or concerned what their politicians are invested in more and more American people are saying not on our dime are saying not uh you know not not not today not not here and also there's many Palestinians in the diaspora uh here in the United States and Europe who uh benefit and could benefit from political education and in in the English language because of diaspora across history the Palestinian investor has been affected in the 70s and the 80s any you know and I'm hoping ever since 2021 there has been a Resurgence of the power and influence of the Palestinian diaspora to ask another silly question since you mentioned the United States I don't know if you follow the politics in the United States but uh do you have a preference of presidential candidates in the 2024 election or is that do you follow I do follow where each candidate stands under different policies I do I think everybody in the world should be able to vote for American elections actually I do follow because of the influence yes yes yeah um I don't have a preference uh whatsoever I don't you know I saw Cornell West on CNN I don't think you know I don't know if he's Gonna Go Far with his campaign Cornelius is running with the green party and I don't think he's going to achieve much success but I saw him on CNN um berating Anderson Cooper and I enjoyed that very much wouldn't mind seeing that on my screen regularly regularly but okay don't really have an opinion about you know Euro Rifka a book of poetry how did that come about maybe you can tell the story of of that book coming to be you know I signed the book when I had a lot a lot less visibility um in the world so when I didn't think thousands and thousands and thousands people would be reading it I decided to include many poems which I wrote when I was young um because it's a it's a long it's a long it's a long journey this book um it's it starts in Jerusalem it goes to Atlanta it goes back to Jerusalem and then it ends in New York and the river is the name of my grandmother and it's it's it's an Arabic name a Hebrew name and it means to accompany someone and I I wanted to write about displacement in a way that was beyond what we read about in English poetry has a medium I don't know if I have much faith in it anymore to be honest maybe like I'm turned off by it um and I'll revisit it again in a few years but at the time of writing this book poetry as a medium it really was a source of Hope and inspiration for me so my mother was a was a poet and she would you know her and my dad would play this game in the morning she would read her poems to him and he would guess which lines would be red penciled by the Israeli military censor because she would submit her poems to the local newspaper newspaper and you know the military sensor has to go over it and you know she would get her poems back with a bunch of words erased and they would laugh about it was very much part of my my upbringing and you know as a Palestinian when you're excluded from mainstream spaces including media and journalism poetry tends to be a place where you can say what you want to say without repercussions and I say that I realize that our greatest writer I was thinking if any literally had his car bombed exploded because of his ratings and you know recently during tattur a poet with Palestinian poet with an Israeli citizenship was imprisoned for a few months for publishing a poem on Facebook in which he said resist my people resist so even that is not necessarily true but anyway it just felt like I could it's a place where I could talk and express uh large ideas in a simplistic way and you know the best example I could give you is one of my favorite poets uh when when the Israeli authorities decided to do the land the land law which classified um I believe 93 of historic Palestine is Israeli owned state-owned forgive me and then when when they also did the absentee property law which allows uh the Israeli governments take over homes that were depopulated from the Palestinian owners he wrote a poem called God as a refugee it's a kind of a sarcastic sardonic poem in which he goes you know God has become a refugee sir so confiscate even the carpet of the mosque and sell the church because it's his property and seller orphans because their father is absent and do whatever you want blow it's like it's a sarcastic poem that was in reaction to these laws that translated to the everyday Palestinian to the farmers to the landowners what these bureaucratic complicated laws meant to them what they meant to their land and what it meant how what what effect are these laws going to have on these people's lands and that I think is the role of poetry that I try to to achieve so poetry ultimately prizes The Power of Words And So It the medium the power of the media of poetry transfers nicely to the any medium that celebrates words so even I mean just writing novels uh tweeting yeah you're also working on a new book a memoir what's the title uh what can you say about it Memoir is bizarre because you know I'm So Young so it's not really my Memoir but it's rather the Memoir a member of the neighborhood which I grew up the title the tentative title is a million States and one and it's so not to how many different realities and universes exist in this tiny one country um and it's you know it's it's kind of it's kind of a documentation of the two waves of exposure of expulsion in 2009 and 2020 and 2021 and the kind of behind the scenes of The Campaign that took place the Diplomatic and media campaign and Grassroots campaign that took place to save our homes and it's also an exploration of other uh communities that are threatened with with the expulsion and other communities who are resisting in their own way be it in beta and nabulous or South herban Hills in in masafiriotto or in silhouan or um in the club all these communities that are dealing with different forms of expulsion and you know the emphasis that I'm trying to achieve with this book is dignity um I want to write a book about uh you know my my experiences that is like super that is super dignified that kind of kicks its feet up on the table and says what it wants unabashedly because you know we are told not only are we going to be victimized but we are going to be polite in our suffering and I want to reject that completely and I want to lean into the humor of the past few years of my life because I think that's really what the world needs and what I need to be writing a few questions here but one of them is about humor uh in rivka you wrote my mother has always said the most tragic of disasters is those that cause laughter what do you think she meant by that yeah it's I don't know if I mean it's my mom that's my mom saying but I don't know if it's like probably a proverb that I first heard from my mom but it's uh Tech like uh the most evil of atrocity is what makes you laugh and it can be you know it's open for interpretation um you should be you should be aware of one one school of thought would say you should be a weary of the things that make you laugh but another school of thought is would say
