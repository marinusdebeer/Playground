The speaker begins by stating that the content of ancient books is irrelevant when it comes to the actions taking place today, specifically referring to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. They argue that no one has the right to kill and displace people from their homes, only to continue living in those homes without shame or reflection. They mention the lack of freedom of movement for Palestinians in the West Bank and the blockade on Gaza, which has been deemed uninhabitable by human rights organizations like the UN. 

The speaker then introduces Muhammad alcard, a world-renowned Palestinian poet, writer, journalist, and advocate for the Palestinian cause. They explain that alcard provides a different perspective on Israel and Palestine compared to previous guests on the podcast. The aim is to add to the audience's understanding of this conflict.

They transition to a discussion about Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem where alcard grew up. They describe it as a typical Palestinian neighborhood facing threats of colonialism, settler expansion, and forced expulsion since the 1970s. The speaker explains that alcard's family, like many others, were expelled from their homes in 1948 during the nakba, driven out by Israeli military forces. Alcard's grandmother eventually settled in a refugee housing unit established by the UN and the Jordanian government.

Starting in the 1970s, settler organizations registered in the US began claiming Palestinian homes and lands in Sheikh Jarrah as their own, using Israeli courts to legitimize their claims. The speaker criticizes the Israeli judicial system for its asymmetry and biased treatment towards Palestinians. They argue that the court's reliance on Israeli documents, which they claim are falsified and fabricated, while refusing to consider Jordanian government or UN documents further illustrates this asymmetry.

The speaker describes how alcard's family appealed multiple eviction orders throughout the years, but in 2009, armed settlers accompanied by police and the Israeli military forcibly expelled their neighbors from their homes. The speaker highlights the brutality of this event, recalling how their own furniture was later scattered across the street.

Between the 1970s and 2009, there were many expulsion orders against alcard's family and other families in the neighborhood. They mention an incident in which an elderly man died after being forcefully removed from his home while urinating. They emphasize that these actions are not simply evictions, but an orchestrated political battle aimed at remoing Palestinians from occupied Jerusalem.

In 2020, alcard and his family launched a campaign to demystify and expose the reality of what was happening in Sheikh Jarrah. They aimed to clarify that it was not a mere real estate dispute, as portrayed in the media, but a political battle with the goal of social engineering and demographic change. The campaign gained global attention and successfully forced the Israeli Supreme Court to cancel all eviction orders, at least temporarily. However, alcard acknowledges that they are still at risk of losing their homes in the future.

The speaker then provides some background information to help those unfamiliar with the story. They explain that Jerusalem is a city where Palestinian and Israeli communities coexist, but Jerusalem's eastern part is under Israeli occupation. They highlight the illegitimacy of Israeli jurisdiction over the area based on international law. Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are considered residents rather than citizens, despite their generations-long presence in the city. The speaker also mentions another neighborhood called Silwan, where Palestinians face threats of home demolition due to the rejection of building permits, which are overwhelmingly denied to Palestinians by Israeli authorities.

Overall, the speaker presents alcard's perspective on the situation in Sheikh Jarrah and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict, emphasizing the need to understand the asymmetry of power, political motivations, and human rights violations occurring in the region.
The speaker begins by discussing the irrelevance of the content of ancient books when it comes to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.

They highlight the lack of freedom of movement for Palestinians in the West Bank and the blockade on Gaza, which has been condemned by human rights organizations.
