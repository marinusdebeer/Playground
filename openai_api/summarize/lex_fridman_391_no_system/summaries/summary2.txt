The speaker begins by discussing the irrelevance of ancient books in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, emphasizing that the killing and displacement of people, followed by living in their homes, is morally wrong. They bring attention to the lack of freedom of movement for Palestinians in the West Bank and the blockade on Gaza, both of which have been criticized by human rights organizations.   The speaker introduces Muhammad alcard, a prominent Palestinian poet, writer, journalist, and advocate for the Palestinian cause, who offers a unique perspective on the Israel-Palestine conflict. The aim is to enhance the audience's understanding of the situation. They then delve into Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem where alcard grew up. The neighborhood has faced threats of colonialism, settler expansion, and forced expulsion since the 1970s.   The speaker explains that alcard's family, like many others, were expelled from their homes by Israeli military forces in 1948 during the nakba (catastrophe). Alcard's grandmother eventually settled in a refugee housing unit established by the UN and the Jordanian government. From the 1970s onwards, settler organizations registered in the US started claiming Palestinian homes and lands in Sheikh Jarrah as their own, using Israeli courts to justify their claims. The speaker criticizes the Israeli judicial system for its bias and reliance on falsified Israeli documents while disregarding Jordanian government or UN documents.   The speaker recounts the family's repeated appeals against eviction orders but highlights the brutal expulsion that occurred in 2009, when armed settlers accompanied by police and the Israeli military forcibly expelled alcard's neighbors from their homes, scattering their furniture across the street. They emphasize that these actions are not mere evictions but part of a political battle to remove Palestinians from occupied Jerusalem. The speaker also mentions an incident where an elderly man died after being forcefully removed from his home while urinating.   In 2020, alcard and his family launched a campaign to expose the reality of what was happening in Sheikh Jarrah, aiming to counter the media's portrayal of the situation as a real estate dispute rather than a political battle for social engineering and demographic change. The campaign gained global attention and temporarily halted all eviction orders, but the family remains at risk of losing their homes in the future.   The speaker provides background information on Jerusalem, highlighting its coexistence of Palestinian and Israeli communities, but emphasizes the illegitimacy of Israeli jurisdiction over the eastern part of the city based on international law. Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are considered residents rather than citizens, despite their long presence in the city. Additionally, the speaker mentions Silwan, another neighborhood where Palestinians face threats of home demolitions due to the denial of building permits by Israeli authorities.   Overall, the speaker presents alcard's perspective on Sheikh Jarrah and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict, emphasizing the power asymmetry, political motivations, and human rights violations occurring in the region.
