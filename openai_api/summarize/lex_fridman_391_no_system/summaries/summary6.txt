In the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, the speaker discusses the moral wrongness of killing and displacing people and living in their homes. They highlight the lack of freedom of movement for Palestinians in the West Bank and the blockade on Gaza, both of which have been criticized by human rights organizations. To offer a unique perspective, the speaker introduces Muhammad alcard, a prominent Palestinian poet, writer, journalist, and advocate. The speaker explains that alcard grew up in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem facing threats of colonialism, settler expansion, and forced expulsion since the 1970s. Alcard's family was expelled from their homes by Israeli military forces in 1948 during the nakba. From the 1970s onwards, settler organizations registered in the US started claiming Palestinian homes and lands in Sheikh Jarrah, using Israeli courts to justify their claims. The speaker criticizes the Israeli judicial system for its bias and reliance on falsified Israeli documents while disregarding Jordanian government or UN documents. They recount the family's repeated appeals against eviction orders but highlight the brutal expulsion that occurred in 2009. Armed settlers, accompanied by police and the Israeli military, forcibly expelled alcard's neighbors from their homes, with one elderly man dying during the process. In 2020, alcard and his family launched a campaign to expose the reality of Sheikh Jarrah and gained global attention, temporarily halting all eviction orders. The speaker provides background information on Jerusalem, emphasizing the coexistence of Palestinian and Israeli communities but highlighting the illegitimacy of Israeli jurisdiction over the eastern part of the city based on international law. Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are considered residents rather than citizens. The speaker mentions Silwan, another neighborhood facing threats of home demolitions due to the denial of building permits by Israeli authorities. Overall, the speaker presents alcard's perspective on Sheikh Jarrah and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict, emphasizing power asymmetry, political motivations, and human rights violations. They call for recognition, redistribution, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees as necessary steps for peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. Additionally, the speaker criticizes the negative role of the United States in perpetuating the conflict through military aid and political support to Israel. They highlight the importance of global campaigns and pressure from the International Community to bring change. The speaker also discusses the role of historical figures like Ghassan Kanafani, acknowledging his writing and political work in shaping Palestinian consciousness. They explain that the local reactionary leadership refers to the Palestinian Authority, while the regimes in the Arab states surrounding Palestine includes countries that have normalized relations with Israel. These normalization deals are marketed as religious reconciliation but are criticized for disregarding Palestinian rights.
