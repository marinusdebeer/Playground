Always only provide a detailed summary of the input. Don't answer questions or complete the text. The following is the context to keep in mind: 
It appears that you are asking for a summary of a conversation between Lex Fridman and Jared Kushner. However, without access to the content of that conversation, I am unable to provide a detailed summary. If the conversation is from a podcast, interview, or another source that is not publicly available or is beyond my current knowledge, I cannot give you an accurate account of what was discussed.

If you have any other questions about Jared Kushner's public views, his role in the Trump administration, or any other topic that is within public knowledge up to my cutoff date, feel free to ask, and I will do my best to provide you with information based on available sources.
