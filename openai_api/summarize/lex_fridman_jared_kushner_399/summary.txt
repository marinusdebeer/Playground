He shared his experiences with prison reform and negotiating the USMCA trade deal, demonstrating his commitment to problem-solving and negotiation. 

He also discussed his work on the Peace to Prosperity economic plan, a strategic initiative aimed at resolving disputes between Palestinians and Israelis. Kushner criticized the Palestinian leadership for their reluctance to make a deal and their dependence on international funding, highlighting the complexities of the Middle East conflict. He also criticized the Biden administration's approach to the Middle East, accusing them of projecting weakness and failing to enforce sanctions against Iran. 

Kushner's role in the Abraham Accords, a series of peace deals he helped negotiate, was another key topic of discussion. He also shared his efforts to develop a business plan for Gaza and the West Bank, inspired by Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.

Kushner also discussed his views on the inefficiencies of government regulation, arguing that government could benefit from more individuals with private sector experience. He criticized the bureaucracy and the tendency for regulations to be put in place to address past crises, rather than future problems. 

On a personal note, Kushner shared his experiences with accusations of collusion with Russia, maintaining his innocence and focusing on his work in the White House. He credited his wife, Ivanka Trump, and his family for their support during this time. Kushner also discussed the impact of his father's arrest on him, emphasizing the importance of focusing on what one can control in difficult situations. 

Kushner and Friedman also expressed their shared appreciation for New Jersey diners, with Kushner praising New Jersey as a great place to raise a family due to its low crime rate, high-quality public school system, and good healthcare system. 

Kushner also discussed his post-government career, where he started an investment firm after leaving the government. He defended his firm's receipt of a $2 billion investment from the Saudi public investment fund, stating that he has not violated any laws or ethics rules. 

Kushner praised Trump's unpredictability as a strength and credited him for not starting any new wars during his presidency. He also expressed his belief that the war in Ukraine could have been avoided if Trump had been re-elected. He emphasized the importance of leadership and trust in resolving conflicts and suggested that a US president should take the initiative to bring the leaders of Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table.

In a particularly poignant moment, Kushner shared a story about his visit to Iraq with General Dunford. He described the experience of being in an active war zone and how it was a stark contrast to his previous career in real estate.

He concluded the conversation by thanking Friedman for the opportunity to share his experiences and perspectives.
