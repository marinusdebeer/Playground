Imagine a city where instead of being confined to towering glass skyscrapers, we lived in terraced gardens with open spaces and a genuine connection to nature. Picture a cityscape where buildings are not just vertical structures, but stacked villages with flying streets connecting them, and every amenity you could dream of just a short distance away. This is the vision of Habitat 67, a revolutionary architectural concept that has been hailed as one of the most important building ideas of the 20th century. 

Habitat 67 was conceived by a young Montreal designer, Moshe Safdie, who sought to reinvent the apartment building. The idea was born from Safdie's thesis as a sixth-year architecture student and took shape at the 1967 Montreal World's Fair. At just 23 years old, Safdie submitted his designs to the World's Fair while apprenticing under American architect Louis Kahn. 

Safdie's vision was driven by a desire to bring people back to the city. He saw the suburban Levittowns as unsustainable in the long term due to their excessive consumption of land, energy, and transportation. Safdie believed that if he could reinvent the apartment building to offer the quality of life of a house – with a garden, privacy, and access through an open street – people would be more willing to live in cities. 

Habitat 67 was a radical departure from traditional urban planning. At the time, cities were being divided into zones, separating residential areas from offices and industries. This approach was driven by the rise of the car, which made it possible to separate these places by vast distances. However, this meant that cities were being designed for cars, not people. Habitat 67 challenged this idea by integrating all aspects of urban life within a single structure. 

Despite its groundbreaking concept, Habitat 67 was considered a failed dream that remained largely unfinished. Only a small portion of the original master plan was ever built. However, 56 years later, Habitat 67 is finally being completed, albeit not in the way anyone had anticipated. 

The construction of Habitat 67 was a monumental task. Each module was cast in a factory operated on-site, then lifted into place by crane. This demonstrated that prefabricated housing could work. Despite facing criticism and controversy, the project was completed in time for Expo 67. The event attracted more than 50 million people, setting a record that has not been beaten. 

Habitat 67 was a triumph, and Safdie became a star architect. The waitlist to rent an apartment in Habitat 67 was more than five years long during the 1970s. However, as the decades passed, its legacy, while inspiring awe, was that of an unfulfilled dream. The architectural revolution it promised never came. 

Today, Safdie's vision is being revisited. Using Epic Games' Unreal Engine, a technology that Safdie could only have dreamed of in the 60s, Habitat 67 is being digitally modelled to preserve and share the design with the world. The team worked with Safdie to complete the original master plan, including the enormous 30-storey A-framed towers that leaned back from the riverbank. 

The digital model of Habitat 67 is a testament to Safdie's revolutionary vision and the enduring power of the question, "What if?" It serves as a reminder that we can reimagine our cities and our living spaces, and that the dream of a more sustainable, integrated urban life is still within our reach.
