This video talk by Johnny discusses the changes happening in the global power dynamics and the shift from the U.S.-centric world order to a multipolar one. The U.S. rose to global prominence post-World War II, establishing structures like NATO and WTO, setting rules based on Western philosophical values and acting as a custodian of global affairs. This order faced some resistance from the Soviet Union until its collapse in the 90s, leaving the U.S. as the sole global superpower.

However, the U.S.' international activities have seen them bypassing their own rules at times, such as supporting dictators, destabilizing elected governments, and promoting wars to suppress communism. Despite this apparent hypocrisy, the international system led by America has facilitated a period of relative geopolitical stability and economic growth.

Now, a significant power shift is happening as China, the world's second-largest economy and largest military, challenges the American-led order. China's leader Xi Jinping introduced the "Global Civilization Initiative" in 2023 that urges countries to avoid ideological confrontation and not to impose their own values on others. Through this initiative, China plans to build a new international order based on common interests and transactional relationships, as opposed to the U.S.' philosophical value-based system.

Reflecting this shift, China is extensively investing in global infrastructure and recently tried to mediate between Middle East rivals - Saudi Arabia and Iran. However, unlike the U.S.-Soviet Union Cold War era, Johnny notes that this time, countries might not rigidly align with either power but would manoeuvre between both to maximise their benefits.

China's rise has resulted in the formation of potential rival economic blocks, like the BRICS countries, who are considering forming their own shared currency, challenging the U.S. dollar's dominance in international trade. However, the U.S. is not complacent, conducting diplomatic visits and implementing measures – military encirclement and technology restrictions – to counterbalance China's rise.

In conclusion, the world is transiting into a multipolar era with complex dynamics and far-reaching implications for global politics, economics and security.
