similar event within 24 hours later in the evening this was a morning event I believe 8 45 in the morning later in the evening post sunset there were reports of other sightings on base including some aggressive behaviors these objects were approaching some of the security guards at rapid speeds before darting off and this is information that was received through one of the witnesses that have approached me at Americans for safe Aerospace was this documented in any official form whether it was a police blotter yes they had official documentation and records from the event that they witness held over the years and I'm not going to ask you to do it right now for time reasons but you would be able to sketch what was when it's correct and you've have you seen that before on any other equipment and or during your flight time I have not seen what they've described this object was estimated to be almost the size of a football field and I have not seen anything personally that large okay and then um another question on follow-up referencing the gimbal video go fast incident um can you just clarify because to our understanding the footage was actually cut off at a certain point but what happens at the end of that video just for those Americans specifically there that are wanting to know about the rest of that footage certainly uh there was some uncertainty or um instability with the object it seemed to rock a bit and that's the last uh last size you know the video much of the data that I would recommend be analyzed would consist of radar data that would provide precise kinematics on the object as well as the fleet of objects that were operating nearby okay regards to the reporting for the dress on as well as representative burchett with the FAA to your understanding Pilots that are seeing this commercial airline pilots are they receiving cease and desist letters from corporations for coming forward with information in regards to safety for potential airline passengers I have been made privy to uh conversations with commercial aviators who have received Seasons assist orders so the American public should know that corporations are putting their own reputations on the basic not the line but ahead of the safety of the American people and I think would you agree with that statement appears so okay um I guess this would be my last I'm out of time I yield I'll be back good Mr Moskowitz uh thank you Mr chairman uh Gentlemen let's talk about the laws of physics for a second uh Mr Graves and and Commander favor I heard you talk about speed when those objects broke uh the sound barrier did they make a sonic boom I was in a jet you can't hear anything it's kind of loud in there yeah you're not able to actually uh personally tell within the vehicle I will say the objects that we were seeing they were spherical and they were observed up the Mach 2 which is a very in uh non-aerodynamic shape what about g-forces let's talk about g-forces of those Vehicles could a human survive those g-forces with known technology today no no not for the acceleration rates that we observed okay what about what they look like how close did you get did you see a seam or a rivet or a section and what I mean is obviously the Jets you're flying have all those things did these objects have those I didn't have I didn't have the detail to be able to tell that Barbara it's in airplanes that's actually relatively close no it was perfectly white smooth no windows although when we did take the original FLIR video that is out there when you put it on a big screen it actually had two little objects that came out of the bottom of it but other than that no no windows no seams no nothing Mr garage as a result of your previous government work have you met with people with direct knowledge or have direct knowledge yourself of non-human origin craft yes I personally interviewed those individuals Mr grush as a result of your previous government work have you met with people with direct knowledge or have direct knowledge yourself about ATS Advanced Technologies that the US government has uh based on conventional Advanced Tech I was brief to the preponderance of the defense Department's both space and Aerospace compartment of programs yeah do you have knowledge or do you have reason to believe that there are programs in the advanced Tech space that are unsanctioned uh yes I do okay yeah and and when you say that they're above congressional oversight what do you mean uh complicated question uh so there's you know some I would call it abuse here so Congressional oversight of conventional special access programs so I'll use title 10 so DOD as an example right so 10 U.S code section 119 discusses congressional oversight of saps discusses uh the the depth SEC def's ability to waive Congressional reporting however the gang of eight is at least supposed to be notified if a you know waived or wave bigoted unacknowledged sap is created and that's Public Law well so that how does I mean I don't want to cut you off but how does a program like that get funded I will give you generalities I can get very specific in a closed session uh but a misappropriation of funds and uh does that mean does that mean that there is money in the budget that is set to go to a program but it doesn't and it goes to something else yes I have specific knowledge of that yep do you think U.S corporations are over over charging for certain Tech they're selling to the US government and that additional money is going to programs correct through something called irad okay um satellite imagery let's talk about satellite imagery we have satellites all over the place some that we're aware of and many that we're not aware of right we're taking pictures of everything at every point in second uh Mr grush are you aware do you have direct knowledge or have you talk to people with direct knowledge that there are satellite imagery of these events uh that was one of my primary tasks at NGA since we uh process exploit and disseminate that kind of information I've seen multiple cases some of which to my understanding and of course I left NG in April so that's my information cut off date uh but I personally um reviewed both uh what we call Overhead collection and from other strategic and tactical platforms that were I could not even explain prosaically and I have a degree in physics by the way as well and I had I I'm aware that you guys have not seen these um reports unfortunately and I don't know why it is do you have direct knowledge we had spoken people with direct knowledge that this imagery applies to crash sites crash crash imagery I can't discuss that in an open session okay uh do you have any information that the US government is involved in a disinformation campaign to deny the existence of certain uaps I can't go beyond what I've already stated publicly in my news Nation interview because it touches other sensitivities okay I'll yield the balance of my time back thank you Mr chairman foreign thank you Mr chairman and I thank our Witnesses for being here today Mr garoosh in your sworn testimony you state that the United States government has retrieved supposedly extraterrestrial spacecraft and other UAP related artifacts you go so far as to state that the U.S is in possession of quote non-human spacecraft end quote and that some of these artifacts have circulated with defense contractors several other former military and intelligence officials have come forward with similar allegations albeit and non-public settings however Dr Sean Kirkpatrick the director of aaro previously testified before Congress that there has been and I quote no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity or of quote off-world technology brought to the attention of the office to your knowledge is that statement correct it's not accurate I believe Dr Kirkpatrick um mentioned he had about 30 individuals that have come to Arrow thus far a few of those individuals have also come to arrow that I also interviewed and I know what they provided Dr Kirkpatrick in their team okay I was able to evaluate okay information I need to go on sure but um my understanding that this his statement is accurate came from a direct quote and this contradiction is a perfect example of why we need to inject transparency into our government and for another example look no further than the pitiful response to the Chinese Phi balloon debacle earlier this year you may remember the mass confusion that ensued when the balloon was first spotted over Montana four days after it first entered U.S airspace over Alaska the Biden administration's initial inability to address the object grew into a continuous series of embarrassments after news of the balloon reached the Main Street me mainstream media we were assured that the balloon posed no threat to our security however after the balloon was allowed to Transit the entire continental United States fighter jets were scrambled off the coast of South Carolina to shoot it down this flip-flopping and obfuscation caused needless confusion fear and panic across the country It's My Hope Mr chairman that this sort of confusion will not be repeated we should investigate the extent to which elements of our government possess or do not possess information that is of critical value to the American people we owe it to the citizens of this nation to make sure that our government is transparent and accountable we must make sure that our government provides answers and Congress must do its duty to solicit those answers with that Mr chairman I yield back yeah Mr Frost thank you Mr chairman in 2022 NASA announced that it was commissioning an independent study team to examine uaps the NASA team is comprised of scientists across different fields as well as former astronauts and pilots in May the independent study team held that its first public meeting which included the perspectives from NASA senior leaders as well as perspectives from the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies the NASA study team is also expected to release its first report pretty soon and I think it's safe to say that we all eagerly await its results Mr Graves how might NASA's research influence the commercial industry regarding safety and UAP I think NASA has a big role to play as far as commercial Aviation safety and it's one of their original charges as an organization one of the recommendations that have been put forward is to utilize their existing Aviation safety reporting system to serve as a short-term fill and trusted platform for Pilots that want to report on UAP it also has built-in analytics capability and is funded by Congress gotcha and also Mr graves are there any other industries that may be influenced by the NASA research on a uaps and and if so how so well I think there is a a large swath of commercial capabilities that could be brought to bear on this topic from space-based or ground-based sensor systems that are available open source or through commercial marketplaces and I think NASA's work as they work to identify and highlight specific parameters that can be found we can take that information and and promulgate this through the public sector so that we can have more open conversation about what we're seeing yeah you know in 2020 the Department of Defense released several videos of uaps um including Mr freyjer's experience U.S Navy Pilots that recorded footage in 2021 the office of the Director of National Intelligence released a preliminary report on UAP events NASA administrator Bill Nelson stated that NASA would begin to investigate these events in fact I sit on science based and Technology committee and when we were doing a hearing with the NASA administrator Bill Nelson I asked you know why NASA needed to be fully funded and there were many great reasons but one of them was actually had to do with uaps I mean he actually mentioned you know is there life out there I don't know and so either way these actions ultimately LED NASA to assemble the independent study team that I mentioned earlier also in 2021 Harvard University stood up the Galileo project to research and examine the origins of UAP so it seems like both you know from NASA and in the higher education Community because of the work that you all have done and people standing up you know I think we're seeing some of that stigma um slowly going away Mr uh freyr do you believe that military Pilots feeling empowered to share their UAP experiences has directly impacted the scientific communities research goals on this topic I would say yes I would say that you know starting in 2017 when it actually came out it took that stigma away I mean I've talked to multiple Senators who said prior to that if you mention UAP you'd have been laughed off the hill and now you we're sitting here today for a public testimony on what's actually going on you know I I'm hoping that this Curve will be more of an exponential and we'll get more and more.
