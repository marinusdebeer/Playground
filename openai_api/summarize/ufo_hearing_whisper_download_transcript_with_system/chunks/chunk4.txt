maybe it could be my co-sponsor on that that'd be really cool thank you for those great questions um Mr Graves again I'd like to know how do you know that these were not our aircraft some of the behaviors that we saw in a working area we would see these objects being at 0.0 Mach that's zero airspeed over certain pieces of the ground so what that means just like a river if you throw a bobber in it's going to float Downstream these objects were staying completely stationary and category 4 hurricane winds these same objects would then accelerate to supersonic speeds 1.1 1.2 Mach and they would do so in very erratic and quick behaviors that we don't I don't have an explanation for it okay have you spoken to Commercial and Military Pilots that have seen these off of our East Coast I have okay um Mr Fiverr I noticed that um um in the Tic Tac video uh it's Tic Tac like the candy not Tick Tock like the Chinese Communist uh app that's correct yes sir I just want to make that because my daughter uh corrected me on that and called me a boomer and say Boomer and I said no baby it's Tic Tac like the candy you're gonna have to just look it up and um but now I would love what I like to say today is a is a day of many first it's a miracle that we're having this this meeting and it's also a miracle that my wife has put up with me for nine years today today is my anniversary so I want to tell my wife happy anniversary and that I love her very much um as she likes to say this nine years have been the best two years of her life so thank you um Mr favor what what astonished you the most about the the flight capabilities of these Tic Tacs very briefly uh the performance absolute performance it was and you're you're not aware of any other objects that anybody in the world has in this world that has those capabilities no I think it's far beyond actually our Material Science that we currently possess are you aware of any other reconnaissance platforms that attract or recorded the Tic Tacs Maneuvers maybe the NORAD system or any of the others I am not okay Mr grosh thank you for being here brother thank you all very much um have you faced any retaliation or arrivals for any of your testimony or anything on these lines yeah uh I have to be careful what I say in detail because there is an open uh whistleblower reprisal investigation on my behalf and I don't want to compromise that investigation by providing anything that may uh help provide somebody information but it was very brutal and very unfortunate some of the tactics they used to hurt me both professionally and and personally to be quite Frank yeah it's very unfortunate as they say when you're over the target that's when they do the most firing at you do you have any personal knowledge of people who've been harmed or injured in efforts to cover up or conceal these extraterrestrial technology yes personally have you heard have anyone been murdered that you would think that you know of or have heard of I guess I have to be careful asking that question I directed people with that knowledge to the appropriate authorities maybe in a um if we could get it get in a confidential area skiff we could talk about that but unfortunately we were denied access to the skiff and that's very unfortunate in this in this scenario um Mr favor do you believe that you witnessed an additional object under the water in relation to your encounter I will say we did not see an object there was something there to cause the white water and when we turned around it was gone so there was something there that obviously moved okay it was it was not the same object though that you were you were looking at correct no we actually joked that the Tic Tac was communicating with something when we came back and because of white water disappeared we were in another instance we're told about the capabilities of a jamming during viewing of some when there were some people chasing some of these objects did you experience any of that jamming or interrupting your radar or weapon system my crew that launched after we landed experienced significant jamming today apg-73 radar which was what we had on board which is a mechanically scanned very high-end system prior to the apg-79 and yes it did pretty much everything you could do range velocity aspect and then it hit the lock and the targeting pod is passive that's what we're able to get the video on I'm about to run out of time but um are you aware of any of our enemies that have that capability okay I would also like to note for the record that um like George Knapp breaking Area 51 he's the reason I knew about that and the reason I know about the Tic Tacs is uh is Leslie Kane from New York Times article and I would encourage everybody to read that thank you Mr chairman yield back to you for no time very good Mr Raskin thank you Mr chairman um Mr Graves um you reported UAP encounters um during training flights I think and have since come forward to warn the Pentagon that uh these encounters may be putting Pilots at risk um my first question is um you've identified these as taking place on the east coast is it just on the East Coast where these encounters uh have been reported no since the events initially occurred I've learned that the objects have been detected essentially where uh all operations Navy operations are being conducted across the world and that's from uh the ultimate anomaly resolutions office reporting all right can you describe your experience after you decided to come forward and um go public with your um experience certainly like many others in 2017 I saw the New York Times article come out as well and for me it was it was special because I recognized the voices on the video I recognized the video itself I had seen it when it was taken I seen it when it was debriefed and so that was kind of shook me because I realized that this problem was still ongoing and so I reached out to colleagues back on the east coast and realized that this was still a safety risk that they were dealing with that they had essentially hit a wall with how they could move forward on this conversation it was at that point when I decided to try to move the conversation forward myself um are there common characteristics to the uaps that have been cited by different pilots and can you describe what the convergence of descriptions is certainly we were primarily seeing dark gray or black cubes inside of a clear sphere I'm sorry dark gray or black cubes yes inside of a clear sphere where the Apex or tips of the cube were touching the inside of that sphere and that was primarily what was being reported when we were able to gain a visual tally of these objects that occurred over almost eight years and as far as I know it's still occurring [Music] um so the I take it that you're arguing what we need is real transparency in a reporting system so we can get some clarity on what's going on out there because there are many pilots in your situation um but we should have a way of developing assist systematic inventory of all of such encounters is that right yes and I think we need both transparency and the reporting we have the reporting but we need to make sure that information can be promulgated to commercial Aviation as well as the rest of the populace um Mr Crush what about you what was your experience after you came forward well uh it's only been about two months or so so I guess my experience has been overwhelming support from uh former colleagues of mine that have you know privately messaged me and and I do appreciate that uh but I I do have knowledge of um active planned reprisal activity against myself and other colleagues and it's very very upsetting to me coming from where uh certain senior leadership at previous agencies I was associated with and that's all I'll say publicly but I can provide more details in a closed environment okay well I I hope you understand that um there would be bipartisan rejection of any attempt uh to vilify demonize or engage in other reprisals against our Witnesses and people who are telling the truth from their perspective yeah there were certain colleagues of mine that were brutally administratively attacked and it you know actually makes me very upset to as a leader to see that happen to other co-workers and actually superiors of mine over the last three years how do you account for that response that seems like a bizarre response I call it administrative terrorism that's their their quiver their tool in the toolbox to silence people especially you know the career government service cares about their career cares about their clearance uh their reputation to climb the ladder and when you threaten that uh flow career path a lot of people back off but I'm here to represent those people so um Mr fravor what about you um what has your experience been since you've come forward with your perspective on this actually I've been treated very well and the six people that were involved myself included all of them have or will be retiring from the military as 0506s and all my friends that are very senior three and four stars I've talked to them they they believe they understand there's a problem but no I was actually treated really well and and what is your general interpretation um of these phenomena or what is your current thinking of trying to make sense of them well I'll say you know I'm not like a UFO fanatic it's not it's not me but I will tell you that what we saw with four sets of eyes over a five minute period still there's nothing we have nothing close to it it was it was amazing to see I told my buddy I wanted to fly it but yeah it's just an incredible technology all right Mr chairman thank you very much I yield back to you uh thanks and Ms Luna Mr grush in speaking to you yesterday um I just wanted to follow up on representative raskin's questions in the last couple of years have you had incidences that have caused you to be in fear for your life for addressing these issues yes personally yeah I just want everyone to note that he's coming forward in fear of his life to put in perspective if they were really not scared about this information coming out why would someone be intimidated like that um to your knowledge our nhis working with adversarial foreign governments in either technology exchange programs or back engineering programs I don't have data on that I'm not sure have you heard or you had people come forward to present that evidence not that particular evidence that you just exposed okay on the 19th of April Dr Kirkpatrick head of Arrow had said that he did not find any evidence of uaps you also stated that you had in your interview that you had briefed him on information that you were uncovering but that he did not follow up with you were the items that you divulged to him important to National Security yes him and I had a classified conversation in April 2022 before he took over arrow in the July to 2022 and I provided him some concerns I had do you know why he might not have fallen up with you uh unfortunately I cannot read his mind I wish she did I was I was happy to give Sage counsel to him on where to look when he took the Helm of Arrow okay and then my last question for you before I moved to Mr Graves is um you received prior approval from the defense department to speak on certain issues correct correct through uh dobster DOD pre-publication and Security review and I just want to remind the public uh they're just looking from a security perspective uh these are my own personal views and opinions uh not the Departments okay so it does bring a certain amount of credibility to your testimony I'm required by law to do that as a Former Intelligence officer or I go to jail for revealing classified information we don't want you to go to jail um my next question would actually be for Mr Graves can you please explain to me in detail the event that occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base certainly in the 2003 time frame a large group of Boeing contractors were operating near one of the launch facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base when they observed a very large 100 yard sided uh ready Square approached the base from the ocean and hover at low altitude over one of the launch facilities um this object remained for about 45 seconds or so before darting off over the mountains there was a.
