people and that is a culture we must change if we want to get to the truth Mr chairman I I would observe that perhaps as we as we move forward from this hearing there are some obvious next steps every person watching this knows that we need to meet with Mr grush in a secure compartmentalized facility so that we can get fulsome answers that do not put him in Jeopardy and that and that give us the information we need second I would suggest that the radar images from that were collected of this formation of craft out of Eglin Air Force Base and specifically the actual image taken by the actual flight crew that we can actually validate be provided to the committee subpoenaed if necessary so that we're able to track how to get this type of reporting and Analysis done in a more fulsome way that would be my recommendation humbly as a guest here of the fine oversight committee I yield back Ms Mason thank you Mr chairman and good morning to our Witnesses who are testifying today I want to thank each of you for being here to discuss a topic of grave importance to our national security earlier this year Chinese spy balloon was shot down off the coast of my home state of South Carolina since the Roswell incident in 1947 many Americans have wondered about the dangers of unknown objects crisscrossing our skies whether these are uaps or weather phenomena advanced technology from American allied or enemy forces or something more out of this world so my first question I have several questions and I'll I if we can just be quick on these first two I'm going to ask each of you the same question and then I'll get to each of you individually the first one when you reported your experiences with a UAP did any of you face any repercussions with your superiors yes or no no I've actually never seen anything personally believe it or not so all right and then do do you believe there's an active disinformation campaign within our government to deny existence of uaps yes or no I don't have an answer to that as previous previously stated publicly yes I think previously with like Project Blue Book yes but currently I don't speak for the United States government okay thank you um I have a few questions for Mr Graves what percentage of UAP sightings in your belief go unreported by our Pilots this is an approximation based off of my personal experience speaking with a number of Pilots but I would estimate we're somewhere near five percent reporting perhaps so like 95 basically don't report seeing UAP that's just my personal estimate um in the incident off Virginia Beach do you believe the Navy took the danger to your aircraft seriously after it was reported absolutely a few questions for Mr favor as an expert Naval aviator have you ever seen an object that looked and moved like the Tic Tac UAP did the Tic Tac UAP move in such a way that defied the laws of physics the way we understand them yes many dismissed UAP reports as classified weapons testing by our own government but in your experience as a pilot does our government typically test Advanced weapon systems right next to multi-million dollar Jets without informing our Pilots no we have test ranges for that it took over 15 years for your encounter with the Tic Tac to be Declassified do you feel there was a good reason to prevent lawmakers from having access to this footage no I just think it was ignored when it happened and it just sat somewhere in a file never got reported in a drawer it happens a lot up here shocker Mr gresh a couple of questions for you too sir this morning what percentage of uaps do you feel are adequately investigated by the US government of the five percent that are reported um I can only speak for my personal leadership over at NGA I tried to look at every report that came through that I could triage so do you believe that officials at the highest levels of our national security apparatus have unlawfully withheld information from Congress and subverted our oversight Authority there are certain elected leaders that had more information that I'm not sure what they've shared with certain gang of eight members or Etc but uh certainly I would not be surprised okay you've stated that the government possession of potentially non -hit craft based on your experience and extensive conversations with experts do you believe our government has made contact with intelligent extraterrestrials something I can't discuss in public setting um okay and I can't ask when you think this occurred if you believe we have crashed craft stated earlier do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft as I've stated publicly already in my news Nation interview biologics came with some of these recoveries yeah um human biologics non-human and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program in was this documentary references video photos eyewitness like how would that be determined the specific documentation I would have to talk to you in a skiff about gotcha um okay so and you may or may not be able to answer my last question and maybe we get into a skiff at the next hearing that we have but who in the government either what agency sub-agency what contractors who should be called into the next hearing about uaps either in a public setting or even in a private setting and you probably can't name names but what agencies or organizations contractors Etc do we need to call in to get these questions answered whether it's about funding what programs are happening and what's out there I can give you a specific cooperative and hostile witness list of specific individuals that were in those and how soon can we get that list I'm happy to provide that to you after the hearing super thank you and I yield back okay now we have Mr langworthy's here okay thank you very much uh I'd like to thank uh all of the witnesses for being here today uh to discuss this very unique topic and I'd like to jump right into my questions if you don't mind uh Commander fraver can you briefly describe your background yeah I was enlisted Marine Naval Academy graduate Navy flew for 18 years got a master's from University of Houston and I've worked in the private sector for the last what now 19 16 years 17 years I do a lot of Defense work so really gold-plated credentials uh Commander fraver have we've all seen the floating Tic Tac video uh that you engage with on November 14 2004. can you briefly talk about why you were off the coast of San Diego that day yeah we were at a workup with all the battle groups so we integrate the ships with the carrier the airwing with the carrier and we start working so we're doing an air defense to hone not only our skills but those are the USS Princeton when they had been tracking them for two weeks the problem was that there was never manned aircraft Airborne when they were tracking them and this was the first day and unfortunately we were the ones that were born and went and saw it but do you remember the weather that day was it cloudy or windy or anything out of the ordinary on the Pacific coast it was actually if if you're familiar with San Diego was a perfect day light winds no White Caps clear skies not a cloud it was for flying it was the best now is it true that you saw in your words a 40-foot flying Tick Tock shaped object that's correct or for some people that can't know what a Tic Tac is it's a giant flying propane tank fair enough did this object come up on radar or interfere with your radar or the USS Princeton the Princeton tractor the Nimitz tractor the E2 tracked it we'd never saw it on our Radars our Fire Control radar has never picked it up the other airplane that took the video did get it on a radar as soon as it tried to lock it it jammed the radar spit the lock and he he's rapidly switched over to the targeting pod which you can do in the uh in the F-18 from what you saw that day and what you've seen on video did you see any source of propulsion from the flying object including on any potential thermal scans from your aircraft no there's none there's no IR plume coming out and Chad who took the video went through all the EO which is black and white TV and the IR modes and there's no visual signs or propulsion it's just sitting in space at 20 000 feet in your career have you ever seen a propulsion system that creates no thermal exhaust no can you describe how the aircraft maneuvered uh abruptly uh very determinate it knew exactly what it was doing it was aware of our presence and it had acceleration rates I mean it went from zero to matching our speed and no time at all now if the fastest plane on Earth was trying to do these Maneuvers that you saw would it be capable of doing that no not even close and just to confirm this object had no wings correct no wings now was the aircraft that you were flying was it armed no never felt threatened at all if if the aircraft was armed you believe the Euro aircraft or any aircraft in possession of the United States could have shot the Tic Tac down I'd say no just on the performance it would just left in a Split Second it looks like we have a problem here that needs further investigation yes uh in your belief is this this flying Tic Tac I mean is this is it capable of being the product of any other Nation on the Earth no I actually I said like I said earlier I think it defies current Material Science and the ability to develop that much propulsion and I know there's been some physicists have done calculations which is beyond anything that we have well either the United States has an adversary here in this world that we don't know or we really have some serious investigations to do I I really appreciate you being here um is there anything else about the November 14 2004 incident that you think is important for this committee to know that you haven't been asked here today no I I you know it's it's been said it's probably the most credible UFO sighting in history based on all the sensors that we're tracking it and then for us to get Visual and to go against the naysayers it's something on the screen or whatever I mean there's four sets of human eyeballs we're all very credible of the six of us that were involved in the thing including the video every one of us is going to do 20 plus years in the military in very responsible positions so I'd say the world needs to know that this it's not a joke thank you very much for your testimony here today for all of you and I yield back Mr chairman as drawless thank you Mr chairman and thank you all for being here and the courage it took to come forward and again the sacrifice that each you have made um I serve on the national security subcommittee for the financial services committee so I really want to stay in the National Security Lane if I may so when we think about traditional adversaries and both us towards them and them towards us you know we probe their capabilities we look for weaknesses and we we collect that data that reconnaissance for in the in the event we need it in the future [Music] um for each of you yes or no question based off of your own experience or the data that you've been privy to is there any indication that these uaps could be essentially collecting reconnaissance information Mr Graves yes Mr grush Fair assessment yeah Mr fraver very possible again in the National Security of aim is it possible that these uaps would be probing our capabilities yes or no Mr Graves yes yes braver definitely is it possible that these uaps are testing for vulnerabilities in our current systems yes yes possible do you feel based off of your experience and information that you've been privy to that these UOP uaps provide an existential threat to the National Security of the United States Mr Graves potentially yes sir potentially uh same answer potentially yeah I'd say definitely potentially Mr Graves and fraver you know in the event that your encounters have become hostile would you have would have would you have had the capability to defend yourself your crew your aircraft absolutely not sir no is based off of the information that you've been privy to is there any indication that these uaps are interested in our nuclear technology and capabilities yes by external observation sure that could be a fair assessment yeah yes is there any indication that department of energy is involved in UAP data collection and housing I don't have an answer.
