I can't confirm or deny that in a public setting and could you do it in a secure setting yes Mr favor no I don't know Mr chairman um you know I think I'm the last member to go but there clearly is a threat to the National Security of the United States of America as members of Congress we have a responsibility to maintain oversight and be aware of these activities so that if appropriate we take action I would encourage the chairman to demand that we have any and all but in particular Mr grush talk to us in a skiff and if that access is denied I will personally volunteer to initiate the Holmen rule against any Personnel or any program or any agency that denies access to Congress Mr chairman with that I will yield the remainder of my time to my fellow colleague from Tennessee Mr Bircher thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr ogles for the great questions brother um Mr gresh I might have asked this before but I want to make sure do you have any personal knowledge of someone who's possibly been injured working on Legacy UAP reverse engineering yes okay um how are they injured was it is it something like a radioactive type situation or something we didn't understand I've heard people talk about Havana syndrome type incidences what was your recollection of that I can't get into the specifics but you could imagine assessing an unknown unknown uh there's a lot of potentialities you can't fully prepare for how do you think we ought to handle UAP whistleblower complaints like yours in the in the future mind so you know PPD 19 process it goes to the Intel committees uh either through ppd19 or icd-120 there's not a good way for the intelligence Community Inspector General to provide that to other committees and I asked my information to be sent to the House and Senate armed services committee because there are title 10 equities at play but there was no smooth process to do so yeah it's a trash can um are you aware of any individuals that are participating in reverse engineering programs for non-terrestrial craft personally yes uh you know anything that would be willing to testify if there were protections for them certainly closed door and assurances uh the breaking their NDA they're not going to get administratively punished for sale yeah I yield Mr chairman thank you um I'm going to do something a little bit out of the ordinary here we're going to give three people a chance at an additional three minutes so Mr merchant do you want to keep going why don't you come back to me Mr chairman Miss Luna if she's on the issue on that list sure uh chairman I'd like to submit for the record an article by news nation and it follows Mr grush's full interview for the record without objection thank you Mr grush why is it that you refer to the phenomenon as non-human intelligence why deviate from the basis of extraterrestrial life I think the phenomenon is a very complex and I like to leave an open mind analytically to specific origin when you say specific origin are you referring can you elaborate on that for those that might if it's a traditional extraterrestrial origin or something else that we don't quite understand uh from either biological or astrophysics perspective you know just like the keep an open mind on what it could be yeah okay and uh referring to your news Nation interview you had referenced specific treaties between governments um article 3 of the nuclear arms treaty with Russia identify as uaps it specifically mentions them to your knowledge are there safety measures in place with foreign governments or other superpowers to avoid an escalatory situation in the event that a UAP um malevolent event occurs uh yeah you're referring to actual a public treaty in the U.N register it's funny you mentioned that the agreement on measures to reduce the risk of outbreak a nuclear war sign in 1971 unclassified treaty publicly available and If you cite the George Washington University National Security archives you will find the Declassified in 2013 specific Provisions in the specific uh Red Line flash message traffic with the specific codes pursuant to article 3 an article uh also situation two which is in the the previously classified NSA archive what I would recommend and I I tried to get access but uh I got a wall of Silence at the White House uh was the specific incidents when those um message traffic was used I think uh some scholarship on that would open the door to a further investigation using those publicly available information thank you and then my last question with 51 seconds remaining you you mentioned white collar crimes potentially being um taking place in regards to a cover-up can you please elaborate I have concerns based on the interviews I conducted under my official duties of potential violations of the federal acquisition regulations the far thank you very much chairman I yield the remainder of my time okay we'll go to Mr Raskin for three minutes thanks Mr chair and I think the witnesses for their endurance and service today Mr favor you've described your episode in detail now and you call it uh the most credible UF site UFO sighting in history um but I wonder was this the first time that you encountered a UFO or a UAP in 2004 yes and what was your general attitude or perspective on the UFO discussion before that happened I never felt that we were alone with all the planets out there but I wasn't a UFO person I wasn't I wasn't watching History Channel and mufon and all that and um have you read experiences or encounters since that happened no um and so have you formed any general conclusions about what you think you experienced then yes I think what we experienced was like I said well beyond the Material Science and the capabilities that we had at the time that we have currently or that we're going to have in the next 10 to 20 years very good Mr grush um you've been able to answer in great detail on certain questions and then other things you say you're not able uh to respond to can you just explain where you're Drawing the Line uh what's the basis for that yeah based on my dobster Security review uh and what they've determined that is unclassified I see so you're answering any questions that just call upon your knowledge of an unclassified questions but anything that relates to classified matters you're not commenting on in this context in an open session but happy to participate in a closed session at the right level yeah okay um and Mr Graves you've said that there are dozens of fellow Pilots military Pilots are there also commercial pilots who've uh encountered the same the same kind of sightings that you described before they are similar Pilots commercial pilots have uh less range and less sensors to be able to reach out and look for objects over a wide swaths of airspace and so Pilots are seeing commercial pilots RCM and they're typically closer and the range of what they're seeing is is pretty large what is the most Vivid concrete sighting with the naked eye of the objects that you described before the cube-like objects certainly I think the most uh Vivid citing of that would have been near a near mid-air that we had at the entrance to our working area one of these objects was completely stationary at the exact entrance to our working areas not only geographically but also at altitude so it was right where all the Jets are going essentially on the Eastern Seaboard the two aircraft flew within about 50 feet of the object and that was a very close visual sighting and you were in one of the aircraft I was not I was there when the pilot landed he canceled the mission after and I was there he was in the ready room with all his gear on with his uh mouth open and I asked them what the problem was and he said he almost hit one of those darn things he said he was 50 feet away from it yes sir and his description of the object was consistent with the description you gave us before a dark gray or a black Cube inside of a clear sphere inside of a clear sphere yes um and with no self-evident propulsion system no wings no IR energy coming off of the vehicle um nothing tethering it to the ground and that was that was primarily what we were experiencing out there I'm over time thank you very much for your service and I yield back to Mr chairman very good Mr Burchette thank you Mr chairman this is for all three of y'all starting Mr grades why did you come forward on this issue I came forward because I felt that my colleagues did not have a way to mitigate the safety threat and I wanted to help them I was trained as an aviation safety officer by the Navy and this seemed it just it just felt right I felt like I had to help the folks that were still flying and dealing with this Crush purely a sense of Duty I first sworn oath when I was a Cadet 18 years ago and I I still uphold that even out of the uniform Commander I was pestered by a friend and I asked why and he said you're the one person that they can't discredit and you'll add credibility to the New York Times article and so after about six times I said okay um this town isn't um made unfortunately by people like you all we thank you and I do want to also thank the people in the audience and the people that are watching this it can't be people all over the world that have kept this issue alive you've endured criticism and derogatory remarks and we're trying to get to the bottom of it and so God bless y'all thank you all so much we really appreciate you guys and gals um [Applause] that's why we need term limits y'all keep clapping us politicians just keep talking so let me ask you all how can the public contribute to UAP reporting and what Avenues you think are available to the public to report these sightings right now I don't think there is a lot of public options for the every man to be able to report on this I think even for professionals that have sensor data that are seeing these on a regular basis they're still hesitant to come forward and so for the general public I think encouraging the conversations that we're having today looking for Technology Solutions that can be distributed so the objective data can be gathered is the first place to go Mr garage I'll just touch on The Whistleblower side of it I do encourage you know current former military intelligence community in Industry contractors to come forward in a legal way either through the IC or DOD or whatever the cognizant digs are um to lead you know lead you know join me in this discussion commander and I I guess I should say this for the record my daddy was United States Marine Corps First Marine Division so overall yes sir he was old school him and chesty puller on pillalu so thank you brother wow yes um I'm not I'm not anything like my daddy he was incredible I'm very mediocre to say the least but go ahead you seem to be doing fine yeah uh for me uh you know I was an accident investigator so the biggest thing you need to learn and I think that Witnesses need to to do is one don't try and make the fish bigger than it was stick to the facts write it down and don't speculate what you think it is because almost for your decision just write the facts down we can get all the facts together and we can start to investigate and get a real honest story instead of it was this big thank you and I want to thank everybody we made history today Mr chairman I yield thank you much Mr Garcia I think I know now we're going to be making some closing uh remarks and so I just wanted to say a few things first uh to our Witnesses I want to thank all of you for uh for being here with us today uh I know that um it takes a lot a lot of Courage um you're telling um a really important information to this committee and I just want to thank you also for your all three of your service to our country um I also want to just note that today's hearing um was both important but also serious and I want to thank our subcommittee chairman Mr groffman I think for for running a very fair and substantive hearing I do want to thank the committee staff on both sides for the amount of work that it took to put this hearing in place um and certainly to all the members that have been involved in this issue prior to prior to the hearing I also want to note for our Witnesses and for the public that I'm I'm a freshman member of Congress and I've only been.
