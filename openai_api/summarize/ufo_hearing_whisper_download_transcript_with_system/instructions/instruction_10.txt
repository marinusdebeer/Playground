During a subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), the importance of transparency and accountability in addressing these phenomena was emphasized by the chair and ranking member. The All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Officer (AARO) and Nassau were discussed as efforts to detect, identify, and investigate UAPs. The Biden Administration's handling of the Chinese spy balloon was cited as an example of the need for government transparency. Representative Burchard expressed gratitude to his colleagues and called for more hearings and witnesses to uncover the alleged cover-up surrounding UAPs. Representative Luna addressed the lack of government transparency on UAPs and the public's belief that the government is hiding information.  The witnesses, including Lieutenant Ryan Graves, David Grush, and Commander David Fravor, shared their unique perspectives and insights on UAP encounters. Lieutenant Graves highlighted underreporting and excessive classification practices. David Grush discussed his experiences as a whistleblower, while Commander Fravor described his encounter with a UAP in 2004 and expressed concerns about the lack of oversight on government programs related to UAPs.  The witnesses emphasized the need for transparency, accountability, and a reporting system for UAP encounters. They discussed the importance of collecting data, including sensor and radar data, to support UAP investigations. They also criticized the 2019 classification guidelines for UAPs, stating that they interfere with government transparency. The witnesses called for more transparency and less overclassification of UAP information.  The overall goal of the hearing was to address the lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with UAPs, highlight the importance of national security interests, and advance understanding of the UAP phenomenon. The hearing also touched on the influence of NASA's research on UAPs, the impact of military pilots sharing their experiences on the scientific community's research goals, and the efforts of organizations like the Galileo Project at Harvard University to study UAP origins.
