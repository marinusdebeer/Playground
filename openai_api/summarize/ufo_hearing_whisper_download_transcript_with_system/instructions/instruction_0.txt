ocasio-cortez in New York and Mr ogles of Tennessee without objections so ordered for today's subcommittee hearing both the chair and ranking member will have 10 minutes for opening remarks we may both be giving some of those minutes to other members of our party I'm now going to recognize myself for 10 minutes I'm actually going to try to get out of here in about four and then we'll give it to some of my friends over here good morning and welcome to the mostly exciting the most exciting subcommittee in Congress this week the subcommittee on National Security of the board in foreign affairs for discussion of unidentified anomalous phenomenon I'd like to thank the brave military pilots and Personnel such as wit such as the Witnesses on the panel today for sharing their stories on how they've engaged uaps which has brought attention to this matter curiosity and speculation from all walks of life have generated interest in studying what uaps are and what threats they they may pose I will say that when I was younger in school I read a book a 1966 book called flying saucers serious business and for a while when I was a little bit younger I thought it was the most important issue out there the lack of a transparency regarding uaps which was one of the themes of that book um in any event it's led to interest in studying what uaps are and what threats they pose the lack of transparency regarding uaps is fueled wild speculation and debate for decades eroding public trust in the very institutions that are meant to serve and protect them as is evidenced by the large number of people we have here I also want to point out in 1966 President Gerald Ford claimed to have seen a UFO and in 1969 in Georgia Jimmy Carter claimed to have seen a UFO so this has led Congress to establish entities to examine uaps the National Defense authorization Act of 2022 established the all-domain anomaly resolution officer aarro to conduct or to coordinate efforts across the Department of Defense and other federal agents federal agencies to detect identify and investigate uaps however aaro's budget remains classified prohibiting meaningful oversight from Congress in addition to aro's efforts Nassau is leading an independent study and uaps to identify how UAP data is gathered from both civilian and government entities that can be analyzed to shed light on the topic however despite these offices being established their lives of pressing demand for government transparency and accountability that cannot be overlooked and that's been a problem that's been around for 50 years the Biden Administration handling of the Chinese spy balloon that violated U.S airport space is one example how the government is not prepared for these the Biden administration's description of events has shown that the government continues not to be forthright between the Chinese balloon being shot down in two uaps subsequently shut down following the event earlier this year the U.S government spent one and a half million dollars in taxpayer dollars on missiles yet we have seen little Clarity from the Biden Administration we must demand transparency from the Department of Defense our intelligent community and our defense industry on the UAP work we're going to ask some questions about that today Congress recognizes the subject of uaps is multifaceted and requires a careful data-driven approach today we'll see Clarity from these Witnesses testimonies I will see clarity as to what can be done to improve reporting for military and civilians and remain committed to objective inquiry Congress should work to ensure that knowledge is not driven by fear today we are not just obeying the existence of uaps we are deliberating on the principles that Define our Republic which is a commitment to transparency and accountability I look forward to hearing from our Witnesses today about ways we can improve government efficiency and openness when it comes to uaps I thank each of you for your presence here today and for your dedication to safeguarding the interest of the American people I look forward to your testimony and I'm going to turn it over for two and a half or three minutes to representative burchard from Tennessee thank you Mr chairman thank you all for being here I want to thank everybody for making this happen today and I want to remind everybody this is a nonpartisan issue this has nothing to do with Party politics I think the cover up goes a lot deeper than that I also want to thank my colleagues representative Anna Paulina Luna sitting beside me here Jared Moskowitz my friend across the aisle has an incredible mind and I'm anxious to hear his questions my buddy Eric Burleson and it's not in my notes here but Matt Gates if it hadn't been for Matt Gates myself him and Luna would still be down at Eglin Air Force Base trying to get some answers he's got an incredible legal mind also uh I know I saw it in the crowd there George Knapp my buddy Jeremy Corbell I've they're not Witnesses but they've provided some statements on this subject and I see unanimous consent to enter those statements into the record Mr chairman without objection also would like to enter in I understand now that this is unclassified and it's public record but as we all know that's sometimes difficult for the public to get a hold of a report defense intelligence reference documents Advanced space propulsion based on vacuum space-time metric engineering some light reading for some of our members without objection thank you um you know Mr Knapp wrote since 1969 the position our military has been that UFOs pose no threat to National Security and are not worth worthy of further study I'd say that's the biggest understatement of the decade he also goes on to talk about the dismissive attitude and said odds with what was revealed in documents reports internal memos Mr cabrill says as he writes these words the UFO is emerging as a major topic of global importance um I can state that as a fact out there I met a fella who came in here all the way from Denmark to be here for this this meeting so this is huge this is worldwide I think we we suspect what's going on but I'd also like to thank the members of Congress who supported our efforts to make this hearing happen some have even confided to me that they've had UFO sightings of Their Own those members of course some of them wish to remain anonymous and I'll keep it that way but also finally I'd like to thank these three Brave Witnesses here they took an oath they took a note to uphold the Constitution United States and Dad government they're doing it and we owe them a debt of gratitude [Applause] y'all quit clapping you're cutting in on my time these folks they've got nothing to gain from this and I think you're going to find out that they've endured quite a few slings and arrows we need to remember them in our prayers and their families and I'm thankful them for their honest testimonies they have done interviews and appeared in documentaries like accidental truth to get their stories out there to and and now they are all here to testify under oath for Congress I it's been so difficult to get here today I've said you know in the Baptist Church we'd say that the devil's in our way and um the devil has been in our way through this thing we've we've run into roadblocks from members from the intelligence Community the Pentagon our proposed legislation to go in the FAA reauthorization that just said if uh if an airline pilot has a siding that when he makes that report to the FAA that it would come to Congress but I was told that the intelligence community did not like that and the bill was the amendment was not even heard in committee I think it's time for this country to take back our country we need to tell the folks at the Pentagon they work for us that government we don't work for them and that's exactly the point this is an issue of government transparency we can't trust a government that does not trust its people we're not bringing Little Green Men or flying saucers into the hearing sorry to disappoint about half y'all we're just going to get to the facts we're going to uncover the cover-up and I hope this is just the beginning of many more hearings and more people coming forward about this and I yield back the remainder of my time um I think is it to representative Luna Mr chairman yeah we'll we'll call him Ms Luna for her statement their circumstances surrounding uaps has captivated the intention of the American people for decades ingrained in even the minds of our nation's leaders from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump Marco Rubio to Chuck Schumer John Radcliffe to National Security Council officials yet from Roswell New Mexico to the coast of Jacksonville Florida the sightings of uaps have rarely been explained by the people who have first-hand accounts of these situations this is largely due to the lack of transparency by our own government and the failure of our elected leaders to make good on their promises to release explanations and footage and mountains of over classified documents that continue to be hidden from the American people this isn't just how I feel in fact the American people largely believe that the government has actively covered up the truth about uaps one poll in particular found that 68 percent of Americans believe that the government is hiding information about uaps and not being honest about what we know about them and from my personal experience I believe the same thing another poll found that nearly half Americans believe that the federal government is doing a very bad or somewhat bad job of dealing with reports of UFO sightings as representative burchett just referenced on the fa bill that just went through you can tell that that's exactly happening considering the thousands of testimonies and videos taken on people's phones and eyewitnesses accounts made by credible Witnesses such as doctors Pilots scientists and active duty service members is unacceptable to continue to Gaslight Americans into thinking that this is not happening or that the potential of intelligence intelligent life forms exists other than humans even more alarming is the fact that these eyewitnesses are many of times service members and have no assurance that their lives will not be negatively impacted or even harmed by their experiences in being an active duty service member working on an Airfield I've had conversations with many Pilots where they were in fear of coming forward for Retribution and or being taken off flight status how do we know this because the government has said nothing to assure us otherwise they have also did nothing to to calm the concerns of over 20 percent of Americans who have reported to have seen UFOs or uaps we are simply told not to question the government and that the government has it under control today is the first hearing of its kind where we'll attempt to get down to the bottom of what is actually happening with uaps but we'll hear from people who have had personal sightings rather than Pentagon bureaucrats who have always been sent to Stonewall investigations just so that the Press knows and the people know we were even denied access to a classified briefing in a skiff prior to this hearing do the amount of Hoops that we had to jump through to Grant temporary clearance to witness Crush who has knowledge of classified information it is time to have an open-minded discussion on this topic to hear the evidence and understand the magnitude of what this means not just for our nation but for Humanity thank you chairman I yield back the rest of my time thank you very much and I'd like to thank you thank you and Mr burchett for bringing this topic to my attention uh now we'll recognize National Security subcommittee ranking member Garcia for 10 minutes well thank you Mr chairman and I want to thank first our Witnesses for joining us today I want to begin by thanking you all for your service to our country I mean for sharing your voices uh today and your courage uh to be here as well uh to Mr Graves uh particularly grateful to you to spend some time uh that we had um for you to share with Candor um some of your experiences so I appreciate that as well I do want to thank all the members of our subcommittee today and also those that are here and have waved on for their incredible interest in this issue uh particularly to Congressman birchet I know that your leadership has brought us to this place today and I want to thank you for uh for that as well as everyone else that's been engaged in this work I also want to thank the oversight staff who I know has.
