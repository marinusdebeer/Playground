The subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), kicked off with a call to order by the chair, who informed attendees that a recess could be initiated at any point in the proceedings. The members who had been waived onto the subcommittee included representatives from various states, such as Mr. Burchard of Tennessee, Miss Luna of Florida, Mr. Getza of Florida, Mr. Burleson of Missouri, Mrs. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Mr. Ogles of Tennessee. Both the chair and the ranking member were allocated 10 minutes each for their opening remarks, with the option to parcel out some of their time to other members of the committee.

The chair used his platform to express his thoughts on the intrigue and curiosity that UAPs have generated, calling for transparency in the handling of these enigmatic occurrences. He reflected on a book from his youth which dipped into the subject of flying saucers, noting that the persistent transparency shortfalls surrounding UAPs have fanned the flames of speculation while at the same time undermining public trust in institutions. The chair pointed out that the establishment of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Officer (AARO) and Nassau aimed at detecting, identifying, and investigating UAPs, but emphasized the crucial need for government transparency and accountability in such undertakings.

Further, the chair criticized the Biden Administration for its lack of clarity in their response to the Chinese spy balloon incident, calling for improved transparency in UAP work. He suggested that Congress needs to strive towards impartial inquiries and improvements in government efficiency and openness pertaining to UAPs.

Following the chair, Tennessee Representative Burchard took the floor, expressing his gratitude to all present and emphasizing that the UAP issue transcends party lines. Noting the roadblocks they have encountered in organizing the hearing, he apologized to his colleagues. He criticized the dismissive attitude towards UAPs by the military and reiterated the call for government transparency. He avowed that the purpose of the hearing was to unveil any cover-ups regarding UAPs and urged for more hearings and witnesses to step forward.

Florida Representative Luna then delivered her own opening remarks. She discussed the belief held by many Americans that the government is withholding information due to its lack of transparency on UAPs. She referenced polls that indicate a majority of Americans believe the government is concealing the truth about UAPs, calling for an open-minded dialogue on the topic. 

Finally, Representative Garcia, ranking member of the subcommittee, commended the witnesses for their service and their courage to share their experiences. She acknowledged Representative Burchard's efforts in bringing the issue to the forefront and thanked all members present for their fervor in addressing the matter. 

The witnesses, which included Lieutenant Ryan Graves, retired Navy Commander David Fravor, and former intelligence officer David Grush, were introduced and sworn in. Lieutenant Graves drew attention to concerns voiced by commercial air crews and military veterans about their encounters with UAPs, pointing out the underreported nature of these sightings due to stigmas, and viewed it as a national security risk. He also criticized the excessive classification practices that prevented important information from reaching the public.

For his part, Grush shared his experiences as a whistleblower, having reported the U.S government's secrecy around UAPs during his time with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and the UAP task force. He underscored his commitment to truth and transparency and called on Congress to thoroughly investigate the claims. 

Commander Fravor recounted his own run-in with a UAP in 2004 while serving as a commanding officer, describing the object's rapid movements and advanced capabilities. He voiced his concerns about the lack of oversight on government programs related to UAPs and reiterated the need for increased transparency.

In conclusion, the hearing sought to confront the lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with UAPs and to foster a fact-based, open-minded discussion on the matter. The witnesses were expected to present their unique insights and perspectives on the subject to this end. The hearing also focused on touching upon the influence of NASA's research on UAPs, the impact of military pilots sharing of their experiences on scientific community's research goals, and the efforts of organizations like the Galileo Project at Harvard University in investigating UAP origins. The general consensus was appreciative of the bipartisan nature of the discussion and stressed the importance of national security, making a case for continued investigation, accountability, and public awareness concerning UAPs.
