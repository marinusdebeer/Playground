During a subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), the chair opens the hearing and mentions that a recess can be taken at any time. The subcommittee members, including Mr. Burchard of Tennessee, Miss Luna of Florida, Mr. Getza of Florida, Mr. Burleson of Missouri, Mrs. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Mr. Ogles of Tennessee, have been waived onto the subcommittee. The chair and ranking member are given 10 minutes each for opening remarks.

The chair begins his opening remarks by acknowledging the public interest and curiosity surrounding UAPs. He emphasizes the need for transparency in dealing with these phenomena and discusses the establishment of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Officer (AARO) and Nassau as efforts to detect, identify, and investigate UAPs. He calls for government transparency and accountability in these efforts, citing the Biden Administration's handling of the Chinese spy balloon as an example. He asserts that Congress should work towards objective inquiry and improving government efficiency and openness regarding UAPs.

Representative Burchard expresses gratitude to his colleagues and apologizes for the roadblocks encountered in organizing the hearing. He notes the dismissive attitude towards UAPs by the military and the need for government transparency. He states that the purpose of the hearing is to uncover the cover-up and calls for more hearings and witnesses to come forward.

Representative Luna addresses the lack of government transparency on UAPs and the resulting belief among Americans that the government is hiding information. She references polls showing that a majority of Americans believe the government is not being honest about UAPs and calls for an open-minded discussion on the topic.

Representative Garcia, the ranking member of the subcommittee, thanks the witnesses for their service and courage in sharing their experiences. She expresses appreciation for Representative Burchard for bringing the topic to their attention and thanks all members present for their interest in the issue.

The witnesses, including Lieutenant Ryan Graves, David Grush, and Commander David Fravor, are introduced. They are sworn in and asked to limit their oral statements to five minutes.

Lieutenant Graves highlights the concerns of commercial air crew and military veterans who have confided in him about their encounters with UAPs. He discusses the underreporting of these sightings and the stigma associated with UAPs. He also mentions the excessive classification practices that prevent important information from being shared.

David Grush, a former intelligence officer, shares his experiences working with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and the UAP task force. He became a whistleblower, reporting the U.S government's secrecy regarding UAPs. He emphasizes his commitment to truth and transparency and urges Congress to thoroughly investigate these claims.

Commander Fravor discusses his encounter with a UAP in 2004 while serving as a commanding officer of Strike Fighter Squadron 41. He describes the rapid movements and advanced capabilities of the object, expressing concerns about the lack of oversight on government programs related to UAPs.

The hearing aims to address the lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with UAPs. The witnesses provide their unique perspectives and insights on the topic, shedding light on the need for objective inquiry and improved government efficiency and openness. Additionally, the need for a reporting system for pilots and civilians to report UAP encounters is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of national security interests and understanding the phenomenon.
