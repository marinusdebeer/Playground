During a subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), the chair and ranking member provide opening remarks emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability in dealing with these phenomena. They discuss the establishment of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Officer (AARO) and Nassau as efforts to detect, identify, and investigate UAPs. They cite the Biden Administration's handling of the Chinese spy balloon as an example of the need for government transparency. Representative Burchard expresses gratitude to his colleagues and calls for more hearings and witnesses to come forward to uncover the cover-up surrounding UAPs. Representative Luna addresses the lack of government transparency on UAPs and the resulting public belief that the government is hiding information. The witnesses, including Lieutenant Ryan Graves, David Grush, and Commander David Fravor, provide their unique perspectives and insights on UAP encounters. Lieutenant Graves highlights the underreporting of sightings and excessive classification practices, while Grush discusses his experiences as a whistleblower. Commander Fravor describes his encounter with a UAP in 2004 and expresses concerns about lack of oversight on government programs related to UAPs. The witnesses emphasize the need for transparency, accountability, and a reporting system for pilots and civilians to report UAP encounters. The hearing aims to address the lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with UAPs and highlight the importance of national security interests and understanding the phenomenon.
