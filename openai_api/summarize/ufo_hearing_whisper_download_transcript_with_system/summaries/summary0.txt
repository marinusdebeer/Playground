The subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) is called to order. The chair declares that a recess may be taken at any time during the hearing. The following members have been waived onto the subcommittee: Mr. Burchard of Tennessee, Miss Luna of Florida, Mr. Getza of Florida, Mr. Burleson of Missouri, Mrs. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Mr. Ogles of Tennessee. Both the chair and ranking member will have 10 minutes for opening remarks, and may allocate some of their time to other members. The chair begins his opening remarks by acknowledging the interest and curiosity surrounding UAPs and emphasizes the need for transparency regarding these phenomena. He refers to a book he read in his youth about flying saucers and the lack of transparency surrounding UAPs, which has fueled speculation and eroded public trust in institutions. He mentions the establishment of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Officer (AARO) and Nassau, which aim to detect, identify, and investigate UAPs. However, he highlights the need for government transparency and accountability in these efforts. He mentions the Biden Administration's handling of the Chinese spy balloon and the lack of clarity in their response, calling for transparency in UAP work. He asserts that Congress should work towards objective inquiry and improving government efficiency and openness in relation to UAPs. Representative Burchard from Tennessee then takes the floor and thanks everyone for their presence, emphasizing that UAPs are a nonpartisan issue. He expresses his gratitude to his colleagues and apologizes for the roadblocks they have encountered in organizing the hearing. He notes the dismissive attitude towards UAPs by the military and the need for government transparency. He states that the purpose of the hearing is to uncover the cover-up and calls for more hearings and witnesses to come forward. Representative Luna of Florida then delivers her opening remarks, stating that the lack of transparency by the government regarding UAPs has led to a belief among Americans that the government is hiding information. She mentions polls that show a majority of Americans believe the government is not being honest about UAPs and urges for an open-minded discussion on the topic. Finally, Representative Garcia, the ranking member of the subcommittee, thanks the witnesses for their service and courage in sharing their experiences. She expresses appreciation to Representative Burchard for bringing the topic to their attention and thanks all members present for their interest in the issue. She thanks the witnesses for their voices and their willingness to be here.
