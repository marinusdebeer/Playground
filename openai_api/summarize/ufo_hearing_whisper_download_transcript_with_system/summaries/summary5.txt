During a subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), the chair and ranking member emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in dealing with these phenomena. They discussed the establishment of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Officer (AARO) and Nassau as efforts to detect, identify, and investigate UAPs. They pointed to the Biden Administration's handling of the Chinese spy balloon as an example of the need for government transparency. Representative Burchard expressed gratitude to his colleagues and called for more hearings and witnesses to come forward to uncover the cover-up surrounding UAPs. Representative Luna addressed the lack of government transparency on UAPs and the resulting public belief that the government is hiding information.

The witnesses, including Lieutenant Ryan Graves, David Grush, and Commander David Fravor, provided their unique perspectives and insights on UAP encounters. Lieutenant Graves highlighted the underreporting of sightings and excessive classification practices. Grush discussed his experiences as a whistleblower, while Commander Fravor described his encounter with a UAP in 2004 and expressed concerns about the lack of oversight on government programs related to UAPs. The witnesses emphasized the need for transparency, accountability, and a reporting system for pilots and civilians to report UAP encounters.

The overall goal of the hearing was to address the lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with UAPs and to highlight the importance of national security interests and understanding the phenomenon. The hearing also touched on the influence of NASA's research on UAPs, the impact of military pilots sharing their experiences on the scientific community's research goals, and the efforts of organizations like the Galileo Project at Harvard University to study UAP origins.
