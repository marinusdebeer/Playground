In a subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), the chair calls the hearing to order and states that a recess can be taken at any time. The subcommittee members, including Mr. Burchard of Tennessee, Miss Luna of Florida, Mr. Getza of Florida, Mr. Burleson of Missouri, Mrs. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Mr. Ogles of Tennessee, have been waived onto the subcommittee. The chair and ranking member are given 10 minutes each for opening remarks, and may allocate some of their time to other members.

The chair begins his opening remarks by acknowledging the interest and curiosity surrounding UAPs and emphasizes the need for transparency in dealing with these phenomena. He mentions a book he read in his youth about flying saucers and the lack of transparency surrounding UAPs, which has fueled speculation and eroded public trust in institutions. He highlights the establishment of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Officer (AARO) and Nassau, which aim to detect, identify, and investigate UAPs, but emphasizes the need for government transparency and accountability in these efforts. He mentions the Biden Administration's handling of the Chinese spy balloon and calls for transparency in UAP work. He asserts that Congress should work towards objective inquiry and improving government efficiency and openness in relation to UAPs.

Representative Burchard from Tennessee takes the floor and thanks everyone for their presence, emphasizing that UAPs are a nonpartisan issue. He expresses gratitude to his colleagues and apologizes for the roadblocks encountered in organizing the hearing. He notes the dismissive attitude towards UAPs by the military and the need for government transparency. He states that the purpose of the hearing is to uncover the cover-up and calls for more hearings and witnesses to come forward.

Representative Luna of Florida delivers her opening remarks, stating that the lack of transparency by the government regarding UAPs has led to a belief among Americans that the government is hiding information. She mentions polls showing that a majority of Americans believe the government is not being honest about UAPs and calls for an open-minded discussion on the topic.

Finally, Representative Garcia, the ranking member of the subcommittee, thanks the witnesses for their service and courage in sharing their experiences. She expresses appreciation to Representative Burchard for bringing the topic to their attention and thanks all members present for their interest in the issue. She thanks the witnesses for their voices and their willingness to be present.

The witnesses, including Lieutenant Ryan Graves, Executive Director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, former U.S Navy F-18 pilot with UAP experience; David Grush, former senior intelligence officer with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and senior technical advisor for UAP issues; and Commander David Fravor, retired Navy Commander and Squadron leader with his own UAP experience, are introduced. They are sworn in and asked to limit their oral statements to five minutes.

Lieutenant Graves expresses the concerns of more than 30 commercial air crew and military veterans who have confided in him about their encounters with UAPs. He highlights the underreporting of these sightings and the stigma attached to UAPs, which challenges national security. He also mentions the excessive classification practices that keep crucial information hidden.

In conclusion, the hearing aims to address the lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with UAPs and to encourage an open-minded and fact-based discussion. The witnesses are expected to provide their unique perspectives and insights on the topic.
