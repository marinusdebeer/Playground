In this article, we will delve into the world of system design interviews at Amazon, guided by Sameer Koppal, a software development manager at the company. Amazon is renowned for building scalable, reliable, cost-optimal, and performance systems, with system design being a crucial aspect of this process. The company's distributed systems and platforms are used by millions of users worldwide. 

During an interview at Amazon, candidates are often asked to design a system. Koppal highlights three key things to remember during this process. Firstly, don't rush into solving the problem. Instead, strive to understand the question thoroughly. Ask more questions about the scale, performance, and whether an API is needed. Secondly, make the interview a conversation between you and the interviewer. Discuss your thought process and the key components of the API. Lastly, approach the problem as you would with a team, fostering a collaborative environment.

To illustrate this, Koppal presents a system design problem: designing an online bookstore. This task may seem vague and ambiguous, but by asking the right questions, you can clarify the requirements and set expectations with your interviewer. For instance, you might ask about the type of books the store will sell, the scale of the operation, and the expected transactions per second. Documenting these answers will help you refer back to them during your design process.

Koppal emphasizes the importance of having a dialogue with your interviewer, treating the situation as if you were designing a system for a team rather than just an interview. If you make any assumptions, validate them with your interviewer. Also, focus on your strengths. If you excel in front-end development, start by identifying the use case and work on the front-end. If you're more comfortable with back-end or database work, start there and work your way up to the front-end.

The key components of this system would be a front-end, a web server, and a database. As you delve into the details of each component, work with your interviewer to determine the right level of detail. Your interviewer may interrupt you with questions, not as a sign of dissatisfaction, but as a request for more data or details.

Starting with the database, identify the key components, such as customer, order, and book entities. For each entity, detail what information you want to capture. For example, for a customer, you might want to capture their name, generate an ID, and record their address and other demographic details.

Next, discuss the API, a crucial aspect of how the data will be served. Describe how to construct an API, including the domain, the resource it will act on, and any additional parameters. Use a use case, such as inserting a book into the table, to demonstrate your understanding of how an API is constructed and how it functions.

As you build your design, consider the requirements you gathered earlier. For instance, will the API support e-books? Can it handle 500 transactions per second? This process will lead to a service-oriented architecture, with services such as a server service, payment service, book service, and search service. Define how these services interact with each other and whether they each have their own database or share databases.

Finally, bring your design to life through the user interface. Define what the homepage or landing page will look like, and discuss this with your interviewer. For simplicity, you might start with a search box and a search button. Describe how the search button invokes the search API, passes the parameter for the book, and calls the books API to get the book. Once you have the response object back, discuss how the page will look to the user.

In conclusion, system design interviews at Amazon involve a collaborative process of gathering requirements, designing a system, and bringing it to life. Listen to your interviewer for tips and guidance, and remember to make the interview a conversation rather than a one-sided presentation.
