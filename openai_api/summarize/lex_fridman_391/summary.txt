Muhammad Alkurd, a steadfast advocate for Palestinian rights, has long been shedding light on the ongoing turbulence in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood lying in the heart of East Jerusalem. He has borne witness to the threats facing many Palestinian neighborhoods, which are stemming from the persistent forces of colonialism, aggressive settler expansion, and the politics of forced expulsion. From his personal narrative as a Palestinian, Alkurd compellingly recounts the calamitous events of 1948 when his family, like many others, was stripped of their home and concomitantly their sense of security, forcing them to oscillate between cities as refugees.

Moving forward into the 70s, settlers began casting their avaricious shadow over Palestinian houses and lands. In an attempt to legitimate their unjust claims, they started leaning on the partiality of Israeli courts who seemed to exhibit a certain bias against the Palestinian pleaders. This resulted in a bitter legal campaign in which Alkurd's family fought tooth and nail against expulsion orders, including their own violent eviction in 2009. Fast forward to 2020, against a backdrop of similar evictions in Sheikh Jarrah, Alkurd and his family rallied from the forefront to champion an awareness campaign, shedding light on the unjust evictions plaguing their neighborhood.

The fruits of their efforts, augmented by mounting international pressure, led the Israeli Supreme Court to annul the eviction orders, but the threat to their homes, however, remained. Furthermore, Alkurd underscores two deeper issues presenting a recurring disparity, i.e., the asymmetry of power lying in the courts and the illegal occupation of Israeli presence in East Jerusalem according to international law. Adding to this, Alkurd brings forth the discriminatory policy denying Palestinians, who have been residing in Jerusalem for generations, their rightful citizenship. These individuals are now reluctantly compelled to identify themselves as mere residents.

One of the major constituents of Alkurd's discourse is the critical examination of media narratives. He puts forth his argument, exposing how the context of the Israeli occupation often gets maligned, distorted, or altogether lost in media coverage. Complementing his contention is the case of Silwan neighborhood, plagued by the imminent threat of home demolitions, and the high rejection rates on building permit applications for Palestinians in Jerusalem.

Alkurd proceeds to outline the simmering anger that permeates the Palestinian society, a visceral reaction to endured injustices of forced evictions, home demolitions, and ingrained discrimination. He debunks the façade framing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a mere religious dissension, tracing its roots back to the pioneers of Zionism—primarily atheists—and the secular Israeli leaders presently at the helm. He deciphers the dangerous and deceitful equivalence drawn between opposing Zionism and anti-Semitism and condemns using comments of anti-Semitism to muzzle political opposition.

Throughout his discourse, he continually harps on the focus that needs to be shifted back to the ongoing colonization and rampant oppression of the Palestinian people and their justified resistance against a foreign army in their own neighborhood. He points out the double standards perceived globally concerning violence and resistance, citing instances in other conflicts where resistance is hailed as an act of defiance. Alkurd mentions that a two-state solution has been rendered impossible due to the fragmented nature and he envisions a unified country that enables the return of refugees, wealth redistribution, and the acknowledgment of Nakba, calling for an end to systemic racism and reimaging of a nation beyond racial and religious hierarchies.

In a further examination of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Alkurd brings into focus the discriminatory legal classifications meted out to Palestinians, fragmenting and impeding the community's unanimity. He discusses the locations in West Bank facing the harsh realities of occupation and underscores the need to recognize the injustices perpetrated against the Palestinian refugees, including their demand for recognition, return, and redistribution of wealth, as well as lifting the restrictions imposed upon them. 

He critically examines the role of international actors, particularly the United States, for its robust military aid to Israel and the apathetic outlook of American citizens towards the funding of apartheid. He criticizes politicians prioritizing foreign relations over the needs and demands of their respective districts, before shifting his attention to regional issues. He condemns the recent normalization deals that have ensued between Arab countries and Israel, masked in the cloak of religious reconciliation but are fundamentally detrimental to the Palestinian cause.

Highlighting the struggle of the Palestinians, Alkurd recalls his childhood spent in Palestine, filled with anecdotes of pain and resilience, embodying the 'stubborn hope' of his people. He also laments how these lived experiences, embodied in their resistance, often gets lost in translation, particularly when writing in English and Arabic due to the need to constantly furnish explanations and facts about the occupation.

In his conclusion, Alkurd celebrates the resilient spirit of the Palestinian people, who despite relentless hardships, refuse to let their spirits crumble. They rise from the wreckage of their destroyed homes, picking up bricks for reconstruction, a testament to their stubbornness, determination, and an undying hope for a future where justice prevails. It is these voices that Alkurd brings to light, honoring them, and in doing so, fostering a deeper understanding of the Palestinian struggle.
