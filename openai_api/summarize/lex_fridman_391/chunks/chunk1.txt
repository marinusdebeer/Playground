posted to his official Facebook his Facebook account naked by now um demanding a second promising another nakaba he has done so on many occasions he has chanted with a megaphone just a few months ago walking down the street in my neighborhood chanting we want Nick by now this is a man who has vandalized their murals who has screamed islamophobic slurs this is literally a man in the government making these decisions right uh and this is similar to you know masafriotto in the South Hebron Hills for those who don't know it's uh it's it's a place in the occupied West Bank where Bedouin and cave dweller Palestinians have lived for Generations they have cultivated the land um and recently they were expelled from their homes over a thousand people were expelled from their remote small villages again if you're reading American Media they would say it would say Palestinians living in firing zones were removed because they're living in a military zone what these media reports will not tell you that in the 80s the Israeli government purposefully classified many lands in the occupied West Bank as firing zones as off limit military zones for the sole purpose of expelling the residents and this is not some kind of conspiracy theory this is Declassified information that was released from the Israeli State archive that was later reported on by her audits also these reports will not tell you that the judge who rules on whether these people continue to live under homes or not is himself a settler in the West Bank I'm not even talking about you know I'll lose the definition of a settler but according to international law this is a settler living illegally in an illegal settlement in the occupied West Bank this is the Judiciary um that we deal with which is hilarious considering how it's being reported on um in American Media recently as some kind of Beacon of progress and democracy that the new government is trying to undermine so there's no representation in the courts for the Palestinian people I mean we have lawyers but no there is no there's no in fact there is for Palestinians with Israeli citizenships for example there's over 60 laws that specifically and explicitly discriminates against them so again it's technically legal the evictions and the demolitions yeah so was Jim Crow was legal also you know when something is legal it can also still be wrong absolutely history has shown us time and time again um that legality does not necessarily mean morality and the law you know is uh the law is a bloodbath in many ways um it has been used and abused to facilitate the most horrendous atrocities in in the case of the Palestinians the law has served to facilitate and bureaucratize our ethnic cleansing do you think there's people judges and just people in power in the Judiciary that have hate for the Palestinian people I mean I'm not really the the easy simplistic answer is yes but I don't really care about the contents of their hearts what I care about the policy they enact right the laws they write and enact are hateful demolishing a person's home um so you can have somebody from Long Island New York who is fleeing you know fraud charges this is the case in my house live in in their in their you know front yard that's hateful so I don't need you know confirmation this is something we see a lot actually you know um Palestinians and people who are pro-palestine and just people who want to make a difference in how this cause is represented we often Run for the first um opportunity to cite an Israeli being hateful you know the recent the last uh Israeli Prime Minister said that he has killed many Arabs and that he has no qualms with it um Netanyahu has said a slew of racist hateful things um josinski the pioneer of Zionism herzl one of the pioneers of Zionism all have said horrible hateful things we also like cannot wait to you know cite uh a confession from a former Israeli soldier who is guilty Consciousness is keeping them you know up at night and we use all of these you know confessions or slip UPS as evidence to prove that this is a racist country that is an acting race racist acts but we don't need this because the material proof is on the ground you see it in the policies that are enacted you see it um in how the country how this regime has behaved for the past 75 years I don't need you know confessions from the likes of Netanyahu to understand that his heart is full of hate so if you could return to 1948 and describe something that you've mentioned the nakba which means catastrophe in Arabic what was this event what was this displacement and dispossession of Palestinians in 1948 well you know like May 15 1948 um is commemorated every year as you know the anniversary of the knuckleberry but I would even argue and I think this is like an a very popular idea is that the network did not begin or end in 1948 the 48 was rather you know a crystallization of the Zionist Enterprise in Palestine um and what what happened was that many zionists paramilitaries that again today merged and made the Israeli Army which calls itself the Israeli Defense Forces even though they're literally always aggressor um committed atrocities and massacres and you know they destroyed over 500 Villages they killed over 15 000 people they forced a very large portion a majority of the Palestinian population uh to flee their homes and this was you know the near total Destruction of Palestinian society that continues on to this day we refer to it as the ongoing nakba and you see it in in you see it in silangi state and Hebron and all of these people losing their homes and in many cases time and time again you know I grew up and my grandmother told me the stories about the nakabe she told me stories about her neighbors who were running away in a panic and they had mistaken a pillow for their offspring and they just took it with them and they realized later that they forgot their child and they came back for many many people who were separated from their my grandmother herself she lost her husband for a few months for nine months he was imprisoned by the Israelis um you know she told me all of these stories and she wasn't just reminiscing about them she was you know letting me know that this is still happening and then and I didn't need to grow up that old to see it happening in my own front yard to see that expulsion happened in the same fashion she's she's talked about it but you know now they have replaced their artillery with the Judiciary they have replaced you know the the the slashing of the pregnant women's bellies in the Daria scene Massacre with with laws that say you know you're not you're not legally allowed to be here we're going to kick you out of your home and it's happening and it has happened in in broad daylight um one piece of context for The Listener who doesn't who is not familiar with the knuckleberry is developer declaration which was a promise quote unquote promise made by the British to the Zionist movement in 1917 committing to The Establishment I'm quoting I think word for word committing to the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine um as if Palestine was you know the British to give away um and there was this whole movement that called for colonization of Palestine and there were different there were different schools of thought in Zionism you know people like zanguo said that this was a country without a people um and Palestinians who have existed there who have cultivated the lands who have you know had diverse cultural and religious and political uh practices they were completely erased and other people like zobozinski um were a lot more explicit and a lot more honest and said that we need to fight the Palestinians because they love their land much like the red Indians love their lands and he had a paper called The Iron Wall colonization of Palestine must go forward um and all of these all of these schools of thoughts were then shopping around for you know Imperial support for their cause they tried they tried to get support from the Ottoman Empire they tried to get support from Germany and this is in the 1800s and then they got support from the United Kingdom a great book to recommend is the 100 year the Hundred Years War on Palestine um that's the you know traces the Zionist movement oftentimes in designists own words um and so today what we're seeing is a continuation and you know people like zabotinski who are like profoundly and explicitly racist who have called for genocide who have uh called the Palestinians barbaric who have said and done racist things you know Japanese also was like the founder of the ergon one of the other militias that later merged to become the I the Israeli Army uh which was responsible for that area scene Massacre which was responsible for the bombing of the King David Hotel um this is a person who's still celebrated in Israeli Society there are still streets named after him and Netanyahu just two weeks ago if I'm not mistaken honored him in a public celebration um so this is Zionism it's not even through my own words what he said to people that describe Israel as having a historical right to the land so if you stretch out across decades but across centuries into the past this kind of thing is a red herring um it's a destruction because you don't think of any state as having rights but there is this exceptionalism to the Israeli regime where it is it has a right to defend itself and it has a right to the land and it has a right to shoot 14 year old boys because it thought they had a knife in their pockets you know a lot of the time people cite the Torah on site religious books and you know sometimes zionists will even say like read the Quran and blah blah blah you know regardless of whatever was written in these books that were written thousands and thousands of years ago the fact of the matter is no one has a right to go on slaughtering people removing them from their homes and then continuing to live in their homes continuing to drink coffee on their balconies um decades and decades later with no shame with no introspection with no reflection that's no one has the right to do that no one has the right to keep an entire population of people in a cage which is what's happening to people in the West Bank who have no freedom of of movement which is what's happening in Gaza which is blockaded to water air and land and is deemed uninhabitable by human rights organizations like the UN no one has a right to do that do you have Hate in Your Heart for Israel why does that matter as one human being to another you're describing quite brilliantly that the contents of people's hearts don't matter as much as the policies and the context of the courts and the laws and what actually is going on on the streets in terms of actions but this is also a human story yeah and uh I feel like at the core of the situation here is um hate is or maybe inability for some group of humans to see the humanity in another group of humans and so it's important here to talk about the contents of Hearts if we were to think about the long-term future of this yeah I mean I would be concerned actually if I didn't feel some kind of way in my heart I would be concerned for my own dignity because the people who Revolt the people who are angry the people who refuse to live under occupation know that they deserve better people start revolutions not because some kind of cultural phenomenon not because of some kind of Desire but because they cannot breathe because they cannot they cannot breathe they cannot live they are living under excruciating circumstances you know Palestinians you know I don't know I don't know how many Palestinians have interacted with but we are some of the most wonderful people I mean not all of us I think some of us are you know insufferable but most of us you know most of us you know we're very hospitable um we're very hospitable even like in the early early correspondence between the mayor of Jerusalem and herzl who wrote the Jewish State you know the generosity through which uh the Palestinian mayor was talking to herzl who was plotting to take over his land is impressive and at the same time you know heart-wrenching um but I I personally think there is there's a lot of dignity um in negating your oppressor and I think it would be ridiculous today today if we like look back at junko for example and we asked the person who's lived under under Jim Crow um if they have hate in their heart for Jim
