Please provide a detailed (keep as much detail as possible) summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
Muhammad Alkurd discusses the ongoing situation in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem. He explains how Palestinian neighborhoods, including Sheikh Jarrah, are facing threats from colonialism, settler expansion, and forced expulsions. He recounts the history of his own family's expulsion from their home in 1948 and their subsequent status as refugees. Muhammad describes how settler organizations began claiming Palestinian homes and lands in the 70s, using biased Israeli courts. He shares his family's experiences fighting against eviction orders and facing violent evictions in 2009. Muhammad then highlights their recent campaign to raise awareness about the unjust evictions in Sheikh Jarrah. While the Israeli Supreme Court canceled the eviction orders due to international pressure, the threat to their homes still remains. Muhammad emphasizes the power imbalance in the courts and the illegitimacy of Israeli presence in East Jerusalem according to international law. He also points out how Palestinians in Jerusalem are denied citizenship and only considered residents. Muhammad argues that the context of the Israeli occupation is often distorted in media coverage. He mentions the threat of home demolitions in Silwan and the high rate of rejected building permit applications for Palestinians in Jerusalem.

Crow as if that's not the absolutely logical and natural sentiment to feel in rivka you wrote my father told me anger is a luxury we cannot afford be composed calm still laugh when they ask you smile when they talk answer them educate them so let me Linger on this is their anger in there in your heart and does it Cloud your judgment does it Cloud management I don't think so I think with I think our campaign to defend our homes was particularly successful because it was honest to what was happening on the ground because it refused to follow the strategy that we have used in our advocacy before where we shrink ourselves and we turn the other tree can we try to convince American lawmakers and American diplomats and journalists of our Humanity um because we wait for the approval you know I was 14 years old when I first flew to Congress to speak to Congress people and to speak to other European Parliament and I at the time I thought wow I must be such a brilliant 14 year old um for them to have me here and you know looking back I didn't know what I was talking about I had horrendously broken English um and he didn't have any any talking points and he came to realize that the reason why we send our kids with their power points to the hill is because of the racism and the hatred that lingers inside the hearts of American politicians who refused to sit on the table um with Palestinian adults as equals um and so we resort to sending our kids who will not threaten um and who will not you know trigger the biases they have against Muslims and Arab people which Palestinians even though we're not all Muslim are racialized as Muslim um and this is why we emphasize uh the deaths of women and children as though the deaths of our men does not counter does not matter all of these things I think the new generation of Palestinians is rebelling against um I think words like you know I think it's loaded it's loaded language uh anger and angry and hate and so on and so forth because it Miss mischaracterizes people and it kind of delegitimizes them a little bit um you know I think the real the real anger is the bulldozer um bulldozing through my house I think the real anger is the 18 year old soldier who refuses to see me as a human being and strip searches me every chance they get that's where the real anger lies um and I'm quite honestly proud of you know our unabashedness um and a refusal to like bow our heads or bury our heads in the sand I think that's the only way forward so I anger whatever it is is a fuel for Action absolutely and it has been throughout throughout history it has been how much of this tension is religious in the Practical aspects of the courts and the the evictions and the demolitions and you mentioned something Divine decree how much underneath it do you feel the division over religious texts and religious beliefs you know it's convenient to Market what's happening in Palestine as a religious conflict because it allows um The Listener the luxury of believing that this is an ancient complicated thing that stretches thousands and thousands of years ago but the fact of the matter is the people who invented Zionism who pioneered the Zionist movement who called for immigration and settling into Palestine a lot of them were atheists a lot of them were not religious at all um and the leaders of the Israeli state today a lot of them are atheists and a lot of them are secular and so on and so forth it's easy to it's easy to say that this is you know about Muslims and and Jews fighting over the land and so on and so forth but it's not it's about the land itself and it's about people being forced out of their homes Benjamin Netanyahu said anti-zionism is anti-Semitism of course he said that do you disagree absolutely I disagree what's the gap between um anti-zionism and anti-Semitism those who are against the policies of uh Israel versus those who are against the Jewish people like what's the well the first like 20 minutes and then I couldn't do it anymore you know but I watched and then what was interesting about Netanyahu is that he said you know being anti-zionist is like saying I'm okay with the Jews I just don't believe the Jews have a right to form their own State that's like saying I'm okay with Americans I'm just not okay with Americans having their own State and there's so much wrong with that statement in the sense that Jewish people are a religious group in Americans and America being an American as a nationality that consists of A diversity um of religions and and so on and so forth first of all on the second the second thing that's wrong with that statement is the whole idea that states somehow have a right to exist or or whatever it's it's such a destruction you have you have people getting shot in the street you have like millions and millions of people besides do you have people losing their homes you have people who are held in Israeli prisons without trial um or charts indefinitely but the conversations that are being held in the head on the hill the conversations that are being held on CNN or does Israel has a right to exist or like why would you negate Israel's having a right to exist that's one now of course I'm sorry and I just I just find it's it's ridiculous again like that uh opposing a secular political movement that was explicitly colonialist expansionist exclusive and racist through the words of its own authors is somehow and also again opposing such a political movement that is quite young and quite recent is somehow equivalent equivalent to opposing uh a religion that is thousands and thousands of years old but it is convenient again for Israeli politicians to frame us who oppose Zionism a form of racism and bigotry as anti-semites but I can guarantee you Benjamin Netanyahu has no problem with anti-Semitism this is the same man who has no problem getting on stage and shaking hands with Pastor John Hagee doing uh web webinars with Pastor John Hagee for those who don't know Pastor John Hagee is the founder of Christians United for Israel who has said on multiple occasions that Hitler was a hunter who was sent to hunt the Jews who said on multiple occasions that Jewish people are gonna perish in hell you can all of this is like verifiable by Google and this is one of the Israeli regime's closest allies right um so the Israeli regime does not have a problem with anti-semites when it serves its interests it has a problem I mean like if you look at Evangelical Evangelical evangelicals or like Christian Zionism at Lords semitism lies at the heart of Christian Zionism it's the idea that we want to derive all of the Jews outside of the United States so that Armageddon could happen or whatever the [ __ ] this accusation has been a muzzle it has been used as a muzzle to silence political opposition um and this stifle political advocacy for the liberation of Palestine and a lot of the time people get caught up in denouncing it and in justifying themselves and disclaimers and so on and so forth that you lose the point that you're distracted from the focal point that is there is an ongoing colonialism happening where people every single day are killed I cannot keep count this morning a kid was shot in Palestine we cannot it's embarrassing even for me that I don't even know the numbers here but this muzzle has been effective and I think the only righteous uh option itself is to oppose um these labels these smear campaigns that Target us um I myself have been labeled an anti-semite by the ADL and I mean like if you want to talk about the surface level people people say like wow the ADL Anti-Defamation League you know uh condemned you but people do not look at the history of the Anti-Defamation League do not look at the present of the Anti-Defamation League the fact that they are um the largest non-governmental police training uh Department in the country where they train police and uh racial profiling and militarism the fact that they have historically and continued to have engaged in surveillance on on Black Liberation movements on anti-apartheid South African activists most recently in Charlottesville when white supremacists were marching um and chanting anti-semitic [ __ ] the ADL advised local police departments to spy on the black organizers opposing the white supremacists this is again all verifiable on the internet go to droptheadl.org so if the ADL does not uh alleviate the uh the hate in the world as it probably is designed to do no it's it's the guys I don't think the apartheid Defense League is really our most Progressive but that's what it stands for yeah okay season no now you know uh if we can just Linger on this idea of anti-semitism there's quite a bit of anti-muslim sentiment in the United States especially after 9 11. I've spoken to people about that there's also uh anti-jewish anti-Semitism sentiment in the United States but also throughout human history what do you make about this kind of um fact of human nature that people seem to hate Jews throughout history especially in the 20th century especially with Nazi Germany what are your in general thoughts about the hatred of the Jewish people I mean I think it's obviously wrong I don't know it's it's this it's this idea that I even have to clarify what I think about anti-Semitism that doesn't say right well with me I think it's completely unfortunate and wrong that um Jewish people have been prosecuted across history so one of the criticisms I think I've read the ADL making this criticism of you is uh maybe you've tweeted a comparison between uh Israel and Hitler and thereby diminishing the evil that is Hitler uh what would you say to that Mr Sarah talks about this a lot um the exceptionalization of Hitler um Hitler is a deplorable I don't know condemnable you know rotten racist horrible human being that belongs in the depths of Hell obviously that's that goes without without saying but I am allowed um analogy and I'm allowed to say whatever I want now I don't necessarily think that that such an analogy is a good strategy to have but at the time the context came in um 2021 when Israeli soldiers and policemen and settlers were literally burning down our neighborhood Again verifiable by Google um and I tweeted it and I also I remember I tweeted something I hope every single one of them dies and to this day like this is some kind of uh you know gotcha for me as if I should have tweeted like oh here's the apple pie for every single soldier that's throwing tear gas in my house you know there is there is such an exceptionalism when it comes to Palestinians we're not allowed analogy we're not allowed expression we're not allowed armed resistance we're not allowed peaceful resistance we're not allowed to boycott because that's anti-semitic we're not allowed to do anything so what are we allowed if I if I can't boycott and that's against American law and auto boycott and if I can't pick up a rifle because that's against the law and if I can't even tweet my frustration out what am I allowed to do you know maybe Netanyahu can send me a manual he's happy with you know so you've spoken about the taking of homes the IDF uh killing civilians killing children uh what about the violence going the other direction Israelis being killed um in part by terrorist action well it depends on depends on how you Define terrorism right across history one man's Freedom Fighter is another man's terrorist uh I don't necessarily subscribe to the definition of terrorism if uh if a foreign army is in my neighborhood which it's not supposed to be and and they're shooting life ammunition at my house I'm allowed to do what I'm allowed to do and again this is another yet another case of Palestinian exceptionalism because when it comes to Ukraine people have no problem seeing ukrainians defending their homes seeing ukrainians uh dying further man seeing ukrainians making makeshift molotovs on Sky News you know Sky News was running most of making cocktails the New York Times read an article interviewing a Ukrainian psychologist who said that hatred I'm paraphrasing but he said hatred for all um Russians is actually a healthy Outlet the New York Post ran a headline um Champion championing uh quote unquote heroic Ukrainian suicide bomber these things we would not even dream of uh as as Palestinians we are we are told to turn the other cheek time and time again we're told that we we should continue living these in inside these enclaves um without access to clean water without access to to the right to movement without access to building permits without our natural right to expansion without you know without a guarantee that if we leave our
