The speaker, Muhammad alcard, discusses the situation in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem. He explains that the neighborhood, like many Palestinian neighborhoods, is threatened by colonialism, settler expansion, and forced expulsion. He describes how his own family, like others, was expelled from their home in 1948 and forced to live as refugees in various cities. In the 70s, settler organizations started claiming Palestinian houses and lands as their own, using Israeli courts that are biased against Palestinians. Muhammad's family fought against expulsion orders and faced violent evictions in 2009. He then recounts their more recent campaign, launched in 2020, to bring attention to the unjust evictions happening in Sheikh Jarrah. Due to international pressure, the Israeli Supreme Court canceled the eviction orders, but the threat to their homes remains. Muhammad emphasizes the asymmetry of power in the courts and the illegitimacy of Israeli presence in East Jerusalem according to international law. He also highlights how Palestinians in Jerusalem, despite living there for generations, are denied citizenship and are only considered residents. Muhammad argues that the context of the Israeli occupation often gets lost and distorted in media coverage. He mentions the threat of home demolitions faced by another neighborhood, Silwan, and the high rate of rejected building permit applications for Palestinians in Jerusalem.
