Please provide a detailed (keep as much detail as possible) summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
The recent text emphasizes the context of occupation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, highlighting the violence that arises as a response to the oppressive conditions faced by Palestinians. It criticizes the media's lack of focus on the Israeli occupation of cities like Jenin and the double standards in reporting. The speaker argues that violence is a result of the survival instinct rather than a desire for aggression. They also discuss the normalization and glorification of violence in Israeli society and its portrayal in the media. The speaker believes that the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, while not perfect, are not the main entities responsible for perpetuating violence, as they have limited power compared to the Israeli government. They envision a world beyond nation-states and hierarchies, and hope for a future without violence and oppression.

um for this part of the world do do you see a possible future with a two-state solution well there's your Palestine in Israel do you see a one-state solution where there is a diversity of different peoples like in the United States and they have equal rights in the courts and everywhere else you know I don't think there's a geography in which two State solution is is possible um as we said earlier swiss cheese there's literally uh supplements all over the West Bank um and I don't think it's fair um it's also soon as fair to all of the people whose homes um are still in here for um in Nazareth in yaffa and so far and I don't think it's fair that like I'm gonna have to travel to another country to visit my cousin who's married in Nazareth for example um and beyond that it's just not possible I do believe that whatever you want to call it one state to stay 48 states 29 States whatever you want to call it refugees need to return land needs to be given back wealth needs to be redistributed and a recognition of the nakba needs to happen that is the only way we could move forward um and you know regarding whether this is like a possible situation for two people to live side by side let's ask two questions let's say you you lived in a house with a person your roommate you just had a roommate who constantly beat the [ __ ] out of you I wonder if you'd want to continue to live with them that's one and let's try another scenario let's say you live in a house with a roommate who you just absolutely hate which is absolutely oppose their existence as a people um you don't even give him you know a key to your to your apartment let's say now you're like equal Partners in the apartment would you want to give would you want to live with him I don't know we'll see we'll see time will tell but you know I don't think I don't think they want to live with us Israelis are quite good you know especially Israeli diplomats they're quite good at um using uh flowery language about peace and coexistence and so on and so forth and they're good about they're good with making us seem insane or radical or like full of hate and so on and so forth but the but the but the policies speak from the from for themselves the the actions on the ground speak for themselves and I I truly I mean every time there's an uptick many of them leave and I wonder I would like to see I wonder what would happen in on state solution well okay so you've spoken eloquently about the Injustice of the evictions the demolitions the settlements uh but is there uh can you comment about the difficulty of the security from an Israel perspective when there is a large number of people that want to destroy it how does Israel exist peacefully this one state solution I don't know by not shooting uh you know a journalist doing her job in the junior refugee camp but that's not killing a 14 year old standing on his front yard this whole talk about you know security and security fence and the whole like propaganda of the Israeli Defense Forces and this whole Iron Wall ideology in which somehow they are always defending themselves even though they're you know Netanyahu and the Israeli government continue to talk about an existential threat about Iran being an existential threat even though the Israeli government is the only body that holds nuclear weapons in the reason they're the most sophisticated Army in the region and yet they continue hiding behind their fingers and talking about an existential threat and talking about how like they're insecure and and so on and so forth I came here on the bus you know I I I live in a I live in a in a house where everybody in the world can easily Google it and get its address and anybody can just walk into my house and this is just and I'm lucky and privileged as a Palestinian journalist there are many Palestinian journalists who lose their lives this is like that's real insecurity but we don't even have time to whine about it because there's real [ __ ] going on on the ground that we are preoccupied whether I'm reporting on all the time that we don't even have the time to talk about how limited is our institutional backing how limited is our you know uh cyber security how limited is our you know even Healthcare you know like all of these things we don't even have time to complain about but they're the real life things that formulate an insecure population um that Israelis the Israel certainly um does not suffer from there's a tension here it's it's true that the ideas of existential threats to a nation have been used to expand the military-industrial complex and to uh to limit the rights of its people so in the United States after 9 11 Iraq and Afghanistan were invaded under some justification of their being Terror in the world these big ideas and in the same way yes Israel with the existential threat of Iran is used to expand its military might over the region and control over the region but it also has some truth to it in terms of the the threat that Israel is facing including from Iran if Iran were to get a nuclear weapon do you think there's a threat from that but who has the nukes right now yeah but like we're talking about this like Far Away monster that's like we're we're scared of you know it's like fear-mongering what do you mean any who has the nukes some of it is fear-mongering but uh some of it is true I don't think it's true I don't think it's true I think Israelis are obsessed with genocide because they have enacted genocide against us even when we talk about like a future a liberation of Palestine when we're talking about uh anything they constantly jump to the to saying things like oh they want to throw us into the sea they want to kill all Jews what kind of hyperbolic [ __ ] is that to say that if I am chanting and Marching for my home not to be taken away from me by some kind of settler Court I am somehow demanding the the murder of all Jews across the world that is hyperbolic and the fact that we cuddle cuddle it is insane to me so no I don't think as things stand right now um as the power of balance stands right now I don't think there's an extensive existential threat to Israel and also let's redefine what existential threat do we think Israel um the Israeli regime the Zionist regime should continue to exist in its forms subjugating people enacting the crime of apartheid according to a bazillion uh human rights organizations do we think that it should continue keeping people on the cage if that's what people are fighting to save then that says a lot about the people who are feeling this existential threat not me do your beliefs represent the Palestinian people meaning how many people are there that want Israel to be gone but what does it mean for Israel to be gone uh what it means is for people who think of Israel as an occupier who stole land that needs to go away that this should be all Palestine yeah but is that a bad thing for these borders to be like for for the occupation to end for these uh for the land to be given back is that a bad thing well there's different definitions of occupation I there's still there's people in their homes now right but is it their home I'm not talking about like I'm not talking about like some random some random home um but there are many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many Israelis who drink their coffee every morning from living rooms that are not theirs that are not theirs there was they were taken just a few decades ago yeah where like the owners the rightful owners of these homes are still lingering in refugee camps are still dreaming of return there are homes on the land of Israel that you wouldn't classify as stolen I mean there is like if it wasn't told like if it was built but is the land stolen right is the but all of this again I I try not to like fall into this because it's just like it it feels so abstract and far away and and this is not how Liberation is gonna look like whatsoever and I'm not like I'm not fixated on ethnic cleansing that is not I'm not obsessed with ethnic cleansing I'm obsessed with ending the ethnic cleansing campaign that has been that has been visited upon me and my family and my community for seven plus decades that's what I'm obsessed with uh all of this other stuff about what happens to the settlers and like uh you know we want to kill all Jews and all of this I think it's [ __ ] and I think it's ridiculous and I think you know um fixating on it is like distracting from the focal point um there needs to be an end to all of the injustices to all of the atrocities you know a little boy from Jerusalem should be able to go jog around the city without fearing getting shot that's like the simplest thing we're asking for here and we want our land back and those things do not mean actually at all the ethnic cleansing of another people well but that we should be precise here so a little boy being able to run around Jerusalem that's a great vision not just safely but without racism yeah without hate that's a beautiful Vision yes but people in West Jerusalem people in Tel Aviv out of homes do should they stay there if you have the right to stay there that's like maybe number 99 on my priorities list I'm concerned with the refugees I'm concerned with the teenagers and the in the prisons I am concerned with my house I'm concerned with my family's house in Haifa I'm concerned there's a lot for me to do before I can even tend to the needs of my occupier yeah that is the least of my concerns do you want the low hanging fruit the obvious injustices to end yeah but still the long-term vision of existential survival of a of Israel which is the concern of its government as concern of its people do you see a future where Israelis I have a home in the region sure just not in my front yard you know which where's the front yard there's literally there are literally Jewish settlers yes one of which from Long Island in my literal front yard yes and this is the case in hundreds if not thousands of Palestinian homes you know no one is saying uh uh Jewish people shouldn't exist or they shouldn't have uh a state of their own if they I mean I think all of all like all all religious based states are like a bad idea all nation states are a bad idea but whatever if that's what they want to do that's what they want to do but that doesn't mean that they are allowed or have a right to create and Implement a system of Jewish Supremacy at my expense that's not a crazy thing to say that is not a controversial thing to say you can have your state just don't kill anyone thank you have a good day you know like that's that's not a crazy thought to have and uh seek and establish a symmetry of power in the courts which is the current source of Injustice I mean that's when it comes to like force expulsions in our home but there's other there's immediate a myriad of other ways to the military the military I mean the police um if you look at like how many times I should have brought the data with me but if you look at how little times the Israeli military or police has and like investigated its own people are indicted its own people I mean just recently um the killer um who has been inhaled a hero by some some of Israeli Society who killed a Palestinian man who is autistic who lives inside the occupied old city where again Israeli military has no business being there or jurisdiction whatsoever he was shot and killed by an Israeli soldier who was trigger happy because again again they have this like um Siege mentality where like any moving object is going to kill them and he was shot and killed and despite it being in broad daylight despite being well documented despite the victim being you know disabled despite all of this he was acquitted by the Israeli Court the military the courts the government they all work together which is why it's so ironic to me that there are hundreds of thousands of people marching on the streets of Tel Aviv uh you know trying to save the progressive Beacon that is the Israeli Supreme Court when you'll find its fingerprints all
