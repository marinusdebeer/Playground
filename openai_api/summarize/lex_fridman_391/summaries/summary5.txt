The speaker believes that a two-state solution is not possible due to the fragmented nature of the West Bank. They argue that a one-state solution is necessary, with the return of refugees, redistribution of wealth, and recognition of the Nakba. They question the idea of an existential threat to Israel, criticizing the rhetoric around security and the government's actions. The speaker believes that it is not their responsibility to address the concerns of Israelis and prioritize the end of injustices committed by the occupation. They advocate for an end to racism and hate, but state that Israelis should not be allowed to create a system of Jewish supremacy at the expense of Palestinians. The speaker also criticizes the military, police, and courts for their lack of accountability and justice.
