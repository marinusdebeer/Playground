Muhammad Alkurd discusses the ongoing situation in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem. He explains how Palestinian neighborhoods, including Sheikh Jarrah, are facing threats from colonialism, settler expansion, and forced expulsions. He recounts the history of his own family's expulsion from their home in 1948 and their subsequent status as refugees. Muhammad describes how settler organizations began claiming Palestinian homes and lands in the 70s, using biased Israeli courts. He shares his family's experiences fighting against eviction orders and facing violent evictions in 2009. Muhammad then highlights their recent campaign to raise awareness about the unjust evictions in Sheikh Jarrah. While the Israeli Supreme Court canceled the eviction orders due to international pressure, the threat to their homes still remains. Muhammad emphasizes the power imbalance in the courts and the illegitimacy of Israeli presence in East Jerusalem according to international law. He also points out how Palestinians in Jerusalem are denied citizenship and only considered residents. Muhammad argues that the context of the Israeli occupation is often distorted in media coverage. He mentions the threat of home demolitions in Silwan and the high rate of rejected building permit applications for Palestinians in Jerusalem.
