Pilots, both military and commercial, need a secure and transparent reporting system for UAP encounters. There is a fear that reporting UAPs will result in professional repercussions and loss of job security. Currently, there is a dearth of data due to limited reporting. While there are national security concerns, the objects themselves should not be classified. There needs to be a centralized system for processing and investigating UAP reports, as well as a two-way communication loop for operators to receive feedback and best practices. The lack of a reporting system is harmful to national security interests and understanding UAP phenomenon. Steps should be taken to encourage and facilitate civilian reporting, potentially through a sensor-centric operation. The objects observed by pilots exhibit maneuvers and capabilities beyond our current understanding of technology. The government is in possession of UAPs, as confirmed by witness testimonies. The specific locations and information have been provided to the Inspector General and Intelligence Committees.
