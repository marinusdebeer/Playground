The subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) continues with the introduction of the witnesses, Lieutenant Ryan Graves, David Grush, and retired Navy Commander David Fravor. Lieutenant Graves, as the executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace and a former U.S. Navy F-18 pilot, shares his own UAP experience and highlights the concerns of over 30 other commercial aircrew and military veterans. He emphasizes that UAP sightings are routine and not isolated incidents. However, the stigma around reporting UAPs and excessive classification practices prevent accurate reporting and understanding. Lieutenant Graves also mentions the upgrades in radar systems in 2014 that led to the detection of unknown objects in their airspace.
