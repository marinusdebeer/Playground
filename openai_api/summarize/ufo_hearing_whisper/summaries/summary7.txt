Witnesses discussed the lack of transparency and reporting procedures for UAP encounters, as well as the fear of retaliation. They mentioned the characteristics of the UAPs they've seen, such as dark gray or black cubes inside a clear sphere. They also discussed incidents at Vandenberg Air Force Base and the speed, G-forces, and appearance of the UAPs. One witness mentioned having direct knowledge of non-human origin craft and unsanctioned advanced technology programs. They also discussed the potential involvement of the U.S. government in a disinformation campaign. The witnesses emphasized the importance of transparency, accountability, and the role of NASA and the scientific community in investigating and researching UAPs. In the later part of the testimony, witnesses discussed specific incidents and encounters with UAPs, including instances where UAPs caused harm to humans and disabled sensor and collection systems on aircraft. They also mentioned the need for change in reporting culture and the importance of secure facilities to share classified information. The witnesses recommended taking steps to provide more comprehensive analysis of UAPs, including meeting with experts in secure compartments and obtaining radar and photographic evidence for further analysis. One witness suggested that there may be an active disinformation campaign within the government to deny the existence of UAPs.
