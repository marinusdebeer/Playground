Lieutenant Ryan Graves, the executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, shared his own UAP experience and emphasized that UAP sightings are routine and not isolated incidents. He mentioned upgrades in radar systems in 2014 that led to the detection of unknown objects in their airspace. He described a specific incident where two F-18 Super Hornets encountered a UAP described as a dark gray or black cube inside of a clear sphere. He founded Americans for Safe Aerospace as a safe intake process for UAP witnesses. He mentioned that more witnesses, including commercial pilots and veterans, have come forward with reports of UAP encounters. Mr. David Grush, an intelligence officer and former member of the UAP Task Force, testified as a whistleblower, sharing information he received from individuals with evidence of UAPs. He called for Congress to investigate these claims. Commander David Fravor, a retired commander in the United States Navy, shared his experience encountering a UAP in 2004. He discussed the lack of investigation into the incident and the need for oversight on government programs related to UAPs. During the questioning, Lieutenant Graves expressed that pilots, both military and commercial, were not adequately trained and briefed on how to handle encounters with UAPs.
