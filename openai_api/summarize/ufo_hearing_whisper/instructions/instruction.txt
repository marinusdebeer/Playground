The subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) begins with the Chair declaring the meeting in order and welcoming everyone. The members of the subcommittee are waived onto the hearing without objection. The Chair and Ranking Member will each have 10 minutes for opening remarks. The Chair emphasizes the importance of the hearing and thanks military pilots and personnel for their participation in bringing attention to UAPs. The lack of transparency in UAPs has fueled speculation and eroded public trust. Entity such as AARO and NASA have been established to examine UAPs, but there is a pressing demand for government transparency and accountability. The Biden administration's handling of the Chinese spy balloon incident and subsequent UAP events has raised concerns about government transparency. Congress recognizes the importance of objective inquiry and seeks to improve reporting for military and civilians. The hearing is not just about debating the existence of UAPs, but also about transparency and accountability. The Subcommittee will seek clarity from the witnesses' testimonies and explore ways to improve government efficiency and openness regarding UAPs. Representative Burchett from Tennessee also speaks and emphasizes the non-partisanship of this issue. He thanks his colleagues and introduces supportive statements from George Knapp and Jeremy Korbel. He acknowledges the difficulties faced in organizing the hearing and emphasizes the need for government transparency and trust. Representative Luna from Florida states that the lack of transparency and over-classified documents have led to the perception of a cover-up regarding UAPs. Polls show that the American public believes the government is hiding information about UAPs and disapproves of their handling of UFO sightings. Eyewitness testimonies from pilots and other credible witnesses should be taken seriously. Luna expresses the need for an open-minded discussion and a deeper understanding of the potential implications of UAPs. The Ranking Member Garcia also expresses his gratitude to the witnesses for their service and participation. He commends Congressman Burchett's leadership and thanks all the members and staff involved in the hearing.
The subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) continues with the introduction of the witnesses, Lieutenant Ryan Graves, David Grush, and retired Navy Commander David Fravor. Lieutenant Graves, as the executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace and a former U.S. Navy F-18 pilot, shares his own UAP experience and highlights the concerns of over 30 other commercial aircrew and military veterans. He emphasizes that UAP sightings are routine and not isolated incidents. However, the stigma around reporting UAPs and excessive classification practices prevent accurate reporting and understanding. Lieutenant Graves also mentions the upgrades in radar systems in 2014 that led to the detection of unknown objects in their airspace.
Lieutenant Ryan Graves, the executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, shared his own UAP experience and emphasized that UAP sightings are routine and not isolated incidents. He mentioned upgrades in radar systems in 2014 that led to the detection of unknown objects in their airspace. He described a specific incident where two F-18 Super Hornets encountered a UAP described as a dark gray or black cube inside of a clear sphere. He founded Americans for Safe Aerospace as a safe intake process for UAP witnesses. He mentioned that more witnesses, including commercial pilots and veterans, have come forward with reports of UAP encounters. Mr. David Grush, an intelligence officer and former member of the UAP Task Force, testified as a whistleblower, sharing information he received from individuals with evidence of UAPs. He called for Congress to investigate these claims. Commander David Fravor, a retired commander in the United States Navy, shared his experience encountering a UAP in 2004. He discussed the lack of investigation into the incident and the need for oversight on government programs related to UAPs. During the questioning, Lieutenant Graves expressed that pilots, both military and commercial, were not adequately trained and briefed on how to handle encounters with UAPs.
Pilots, both military and commercial, need a secure and transparent reporting system for UAP encounters. There is a fear that reporting UAPs will result in professional repercussions and loss of job security. Currently, there is a dearth of data due to limited reporting. While there are national security concerns, the objects themselves should not be classified. There needs to be a centralized system for processing and investigating UAP reports, as well as a two-way communication loop for operators to receive feedback and best practices. The lack of a reporting system is harmful to national security interests and understanding UAP phenomenon. Steps should be taken to encourage and facilitate civilian reporting, potentially through a sensor-centric operation. The objects observed by pilots exhibit maneuvers and capabilities beyond our current understanding of technology. The government is in possession of UAPs, as confirmed by witness testimonies. The specific locations and information have been provided to the Inspector General and Intelligence Committees.
In this chunk of text, the witnesses are discussing their experiences and encounters with UAPs. They talk about the need for transparency and a reporting system for UAP encounters, as well as the fear of retaliation for coming forward with their testimonies. They also mention the characteristics of the UAPs they've seen, such as dark gray or black cubes inside a clear sphere. The witnesses discuss the lack of understanding of the technology behind these objects and the potential national security implications. They provide examples of incidents at Vandenberg Air Force Base and discuss the size and behavior of the UAPs. The witnesses also mention the importance of proper documentation and official records of these encounters.

The witnesses also discuss their experiences with UAPs, including the size, behavior, and lack of understanding of the technology behind them. They talk about incidents at Vandenberg Air Force Base, the speed, G-forces, and appearance of the UAPs. One witness mentions having direct knowledge of non-human origin craft and unsanctioned advanced technology programs. They also discuss satellite imagery and the potential involvement of the U.S. government in a disinformation campaign. The witnesses emphasize the importance of transparency, accountability, and the role of NASA and the scientific community in investigating and researching UAPs. Partnerships between the scientific community and UAP focus groups within the government are also mentioned as necessary for further collaboration.
