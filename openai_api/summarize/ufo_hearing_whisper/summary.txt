The long-awaited subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), more casually known as UFOs, commenced with the Chair formally recognizing the meeting and welcoming everyone. The members of the subcommittee were unanimously ushered into the hearing. Appreciating the gravity of the meeting, the Chair reminded everyone of the vital necessity for open dialogue and thanked military pilots and personnel for their collaboration in shedding light on UAPs.

Over the years, the lack of transparency in handling UAP sightings and events has contributed to the erosion of public trust and spiked speculation. Entities such as AARO and NASA have been established to further study UAPs, but there remains a persistent call for governmental transparency. The Biden administration's handling of the Chinese spy balloon incident and subsequent UAP occurrences have sparked concerns about government accountability which Congress recognizes. The importance of objective inquiry in relation to UAPs cannot be overstated as Congress seeks to enhance reporting both to the military and among civilians. The hearing transcends mere debate over the existence of UAPs but delves into matters of transparency and accountability.
   
Taking the floor, Representative Burchett from Tennessee praised the non-partisanship around the issue, stating that it was indeed a matter of national interest. The hearing faced logistical issues but was successfully organized thanks to the unwavering commitment to transparency and public trust. 
  
Adding his voice to the hearing, Representative Luna from Florida lamented that excessive classification of documents and lack of transparency have propagated the perception of a coverup surrounding UAPs. The American public, polls indicate, believes that the government is withholding information about UAPs. Luna vouched for an open-minded discussion about the potential implications of UAPs based on credible eyewitness testimonies.

The witnesses at the hearing comprised Lieutenant Ryan Graves, David Grush, and retired Navy Commander David Fravor. From his experiences as an executive director at Americans for Safe Aerospace and his tenure as a U.S. Navy F-18 pilot, Lieutenant Graves shared his encounters with UAPs. He emphasized these were not isolated incidents, sightings of UAPs had somewhat become routine. However, reporting these phenomena was riddled with stigmatization, and the rampant practice of over-classification hindered an accurate understanding of the UAPs.

Mr. David Grush, a former member of the UAP Task Force and current intelligence officer, took the stand to voice a whistleblower's account. He brought to light information he received from individuals with evidence of UAPs. His testimony called for Congress to probe these claims. Commander David Fravor, a retired commander in the United States Navy, lent further credibility to the hearing by recounting his UAP encounter in 2004. He underscored the lack of thorough investigation into the matter and emphasized the need for stronger oversight on government programs related to UAPs.

During cross-examinations, Lieutenant Graves lamented that pilots were ill-prepared for encounters with UAPs as they lacked appropriate training and briefings. A secure and transparent reporting system for UAP encounters was sorely needed. Pilots fear professional repercussions and a dent in their job security for reporting such phenomena. The lack of a structured reporting system complicates understanding the UAP phenomenon and presents a threat to national security. Witnesses like Lieutenant Graves vouched for a centralized system that processes and investigates UAP reports and also enables operators to get feedback and learn best practices.

Further testimony shed light on encounters with UAPs that caused harm to humans and disabled sensor and collection systems on aircraft. Witnesses called for a cultural shift in reporting these encounters and recommended secure facilities for sharing classified information. They believed that urgent steps should be taken to facilitate comprehensive analysis of UAPs. This could be achieved by organizing meetings with experts in secure compartments and obtaining radar and photographic evidence for further analysis. One of the witnesses hinted at an active disinformation campaign within the government to deny the existence of UAPs, calling for further investigation into the matter. 

Witnesses also shared their observations on the UAPs. Some described them as dark gray or black cubes enclosed in a clear sphere. They recalled instances at Vandenberg Air Force Base, describing the UAPs' speed, G-forces, and their uncanny behavior. Some testified to have direct knowledge of non-human origin craft and unsanctioned advanced technology programs, also suggesting the potential involvement of the U.S. government in a disinformation campaign.

Appreciating the gravity of the issue, witnesses emphasized the importance of transparency, accountability, and the critical role of NASA and the scientific community in investigating UAPs.

The hearing concluded with witnesses suggesting the need to invite specific individuals and agencies that could provide more insight into UAPs. Their testimony underscored the necessity of a comprehensive analysis of UAPs and the vital value of expert consultation. After a wide-ranging discussion on the issue, the solidarity of the subcommittee was clear: the pursuit of truth and transparency regarding UAPs was essential to maintaining public trust and promise was made to make more information public in the future.
