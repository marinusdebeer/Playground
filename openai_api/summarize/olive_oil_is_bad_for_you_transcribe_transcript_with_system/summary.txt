Plant-based physician Dr. Michael Klaper underlines the significance of nutrition to our overall health and well-being. He explains that food molecules are circulated through every one of our cells, with the power to activate or deactivate genes, and stimulate or shut down enzymes. Because of these factors, Dr. Klaper stresses the importance of what we choose to incorporate into our diets. To help educate the general public, Dr. Klaper joined forces with Mindvalley in offering free masterclasses focusing on the interconnectedness of the mind, body, soul, relationships, and conscious entrepreneurship.

Dr. Klaper also relates his personal journey towards the adoption of a plant-based diet. His path began when, as a general practitioner, he found himself growing increasingly frustrated with the alarming trend of his patients’ deteriorating health. He saw them suffering from heart attacks and strokes, yet felt helpless in providing them with the necessary preventative strategies. Motivated to better understand these conditions, he opted to specialize as an anesthesiologist, where he was exposed to the true nature of the culprits behind heart attacks and strokes – fatty deposits. Realizing that these deposits are reversible through diet, Dr. Klaper committed to a whole food, plant-based diet, and was astonished by the improvements in his health, so much so that he decided to return to general practice. Now equipped with a plant-based solution, he determined to help his patients strive for similar health goals.

His experiences have led Dr. Klaper to highlight and call attention to the significant lack of nutrition education that doctors receive in medical school. This gap in medical education means that many physicians are unaware of the huge role diet plays in disease prevention and management. He attributes this mostly to the influence exerted by the meat and dairy industries, as well as the medical field's focus on drugs and surgeries. However, he remains optimistic about the future. With documentaries and in-depth information on plant-based diets readily available, he hopes the new generation of medical students will instigate the much-needed paradigm shift in the medical field's understanding and treatment of nutrition.

Aligned with this mission, Dr. Klaper is presently involved in a major initiative: Moving Medicine Forward, aiming to incorporate nutrition into medical school curricula and promote evidence-based research into the benefits of plant-based diets. He holds strong faith that as more people get educated about the benefits of plant-based diets and as the plant-based food industry continues to advance, the shift towards a plant-based lifestyle will become a widely accepted standard. He also attempts to dismantle the misconception that plant-based diets are restrictive by pitching the variety and deliciousness of plant-based cuisine.

Guiding his in-depth understanding of nutrition, Dr. Klaper has some pertinent advice about fat intake. He cautions against the use of extracted oils, even those considered healthy like olive oil. He explains that these oils lack fiber and other nutrients found in whole foods. When consumed, fats are isolated from fiber and condensed, leading to the body absorbing large amounts of fats at once. Instead, he recommends fats from avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives, which come with their packaging of fibers and other nutrients. This allows for a slower, more natural digestion and absorption process, leading to healthier body functions. He suggests a moderate intake of fats, typically around 10-20% of daily caloric intake. Nonetheless, this should be personalized to each individual's unique needs and thus, a consultation with a healthcare professional is always recommended.

Dr. Klaper also warns about high sodium diets’ implications. Necessary in small amounts, excessive salt intake can stiffen artery walls, increase fluid retention, cause high blood pressure, and lead to severe conditions like heart attacks, strokes, and autoimmune diseases. His advice is to reduce consumption of processed foods and to add just a pinch of salt to food at the table for flavor.

In the context of genes' role in health, he enlightens that while some may have a genetic predisposition to certain diseases, food and lifestyle choices greatly determine their manifestation. Food molecules impact gene expression, turning specific genes on or off. In the end, Dr. Klaper believes that with a diet rich in plant-based whole foods, even individuals with genetic predispositions can positively influence gene expression and lower their risk of disease. People can steer their health outcomes by choosing a diet and lifestyle that bolster optimal gene expression.

In conclusion, Dr. Klaper’s emphasis on the power of nutrition in preventing and reversing chronic diseases, his advocacy for its inclusion in medical education, and his guidance can contribute immensely to a transformed perception of health and well-being. By embracing plant-based diets and adapting to healthier lifestyle choices, individuals can indeed take control of their health destiny.
