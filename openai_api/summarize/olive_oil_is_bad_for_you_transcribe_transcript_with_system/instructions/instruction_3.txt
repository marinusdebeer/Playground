Please provide a detailed summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
The lipase enzymes break down the fats in the olive, allowing for proper digestion and absorption. This slow and natural process allows the body to utilize fats in a healthy way. On the other hand, when you consume extracted oils like olive oil, the fats are separated from the fiber and concentrated into a liquid form. This makes it much easier for the body to absorb large amounts of fat at once, leading to imbalances and potential health issues.  Dr. Klaper advises against the use of extracted oils, including olive oil, as they lack the fiber and other nutrients found in whole plant foods. He recommends obtaining fats from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives, as they come packaged with fiber and other beneficial compounds. These whole plant foods provide a balanced and natural source of fats that the body can properly process and utilize.  In terms of quantity, Dr. Klaper suggests a moderate intake of fats, typically ranging from 10-20% of daily caloric intake. This allows for a sufficient intake of essential fatty acids while keeping overall fat intake in check. However, it is important to note that individual needs may vary based on factors such as activity level, age, and underlying health conditions. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance.  In summary, Dr. Klaper emphasizes the importance of obtaining fats from whole plant foods rather than extracted oils. He recommends a moderate intake of fats, obtained from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives, to ensure a balanced and healthy diet.

enzymes have to come in and emulsify the fats. And as a result, the actual amount of olive fat, olive oil that's in that whole olive is a tiny amount. It rises in your bloodstream very slowly. One pass through your liver. It's pretty much taken out of there. Doesn't have much of a pharmaceutical effect. But you take 50 hours, 100 hours. You crush the fat out of them. Now you got liquid olive fat in a bottle or coconut fat or any any liquid vegetable oil. And you go Mediterranean diet. and you pour that oil on your salad and on your food and eat that, nothing slows down the absorption. That stuff leaps into your bloodstream. Now you got two tablespoons of liquid fat floating in your blood. You can see the globules of fat in the bloodstream under the microscope. And that fat starts having pharmaceutical effects. Those droplets of fat will work their way into the walls of the arteries. They inhibit the production of nitric oxide that allows the artery walls to dilate, keep your blood pressure low. That fat works its way into your liver cells and muscle cells, interferes with your insulin receptors, makes you more insulin resistant. It interferes with blood clotting. That liquid oil has pharmaceutical effects that are not healthy for you. And people are eating this day after day after day. Plus it's fat that flows through your fat stores and sticks there. When you look at the studies of the Mediterranean diet, where they compare people eating nuts versus olive oil. Both groups, as the study goes on for two years, both groups are putting on weight. They're both getting fatter. None of these people had reversal of their heart disease. None of them died with all this fat will not melt away the plaques in your arteries like the whole food plant-based diet will, as Dr. Esselstyn and Dr. Ornish have demonstrated. It's just no other animal crushes the fat out of their food and pours liquid fat on their food. It's just a bizarre thing to do. Strictly a taste thing. But again, like Dr. McDougall says, people love to hear good news about bad habits. And ooh, olive oil is good for you. No, it's not. None of these fats really are. And when you stop eating them, we saute our veggies in vegetable broth now. And when you stop eating it, your taste buds change. And it makes such a difference. My wife and I were out at a restaurant a few months ago and we ordered our meals and it comes with sauteed vegetables on the side. Ooh, that's nice. Well, they were sauteed in oil. And the waiter brought them to the table and it was dripping with oil. We couldn't eat it. It was just disgusting. We realized how much our taste buds had changed. You really don't need oil in your diet at all. You need healthy fats. But again, get it out of olives and avocados. Don't get it out of glass bottles. It's just not healthy. I never thought of sauteing my vegetables in vegetable broth. I've never thought of that before. That must taste delicious. Oh, it is. You can buy boxes of it at the grocery store there or you can make your own. But, oh, that's what to saute your veggies. But anything wet will work. Water, if you make it, my wife makes these fabulous soups and we'll take a couple of tablespoons of the soup broth, throw it in the skillet and we stir fry our veggies in the soup. The beer will work. The alcohol will evaporate. Anything you want. We're not beer drinkers. But anything will work. You don't have to saute your veggies in oil. And once you stop, they taste much better. And I've heard from other doctors who've told me that they're like, look, olive oil is not healthy. But if you're using lard to cook your food every morning, it's a gap. It's a bridge to get you to where you need to be. Yeah, but none of it is necessary. None of it's really healthy for you. Time to grow past that already. Fair enough. So what is the best time to eat? Like, what are the time periods of the day you should eat? Because there's a lot of myths about that. You should be eating five, six times a day. You should be eating three meals a day. You should be eating one meal a day. Intermittent fasting. What's the truth in your opinion? Right, we're still feeling our way through that. But the folks who think, oh, I graze all day. I eat five meals a day. Not a good thing, especially if you're eating a whole food plant-based diet or even worse, even a refined plant-based diet with refined carbohydrates and flour products, et cetera. Why? Because that keeps your insulin levels up hour after hour after hour. If you're constantly eating flour products and refined grains, et cetera, it's not good to walk around with high insulin levels hour after hour that may foster inflammation and excess fat storage, et cetera. So yes, we should eat discrete meals a couple of times a day. And so then we get into the intermittent fasting folks who just eat during an eight-hour window. Just don't start your eating till noon. You finish your eating by six and fast the rest of the time. And there may be some advantage to that. It's turning out that I'm listening now to a Rich Roll podcast who has Dr. Walter Longo as his guest. And Dr. Longo says that research is showing that actually it's a 12-hour window seems to be the most beneficial as far as improving the oxidative stress in your body, et cetera. So stop eating at say seven in the evening and don't start again till seven or eight in the morning. And that seems to be a doable and physiologic appropriate way to time your eating. So we can have a breakfast of say whole grains. I have a big salad for lunch and we have a very light dinner and steamed veggies. We live on soups, salads, and greens. We have big salads, steamed veggies and hearty vegetable soups. That's the majority of our diet. And by six or seven in the evening, we're through with eating. And that seems to work very well for us at least. The 12-hour window seems to be the most practical. So another issue is salt. A lot of people talk about plant-based. I'm on a plant-based diet. I'm plant-based, I'm vegan, I'm vegan, but they're putting tons and tons of salt. And we've already discussed fat, but it's generally fat and salt that is put in. So can you talk about what a high salt diet does even if you're eating a plant-based diet, which from my understanding nullifies a little bit. It's better than eating meat, obviously. But even then, can you tell us the warnings about what a high salt diet can do to you, even on a plant-based diet? You bet. We absolutely need some salt in your diet. We need sodium, but it's in the celery, it's in the veggies, it's in the everything has a little bit of sodium in it. Very few people need to add additional salt. There's some folks of the bell-shaped curve of human beings, there are some folks who need a little extra sodium, their blood pressure is too low without it. So the best way to look at this is one, you wanna avoid a high salt diet. Why? Because one, the salt stiffens your artery walls and makes you retain fluid that will raise your blood pressure and set you up for heart attacks and strokes. But also we're learning that a high salt diet stimulates certain immune cells, your Th17 helper cells. And that opens the door to autoimmune diseases, who knew? But high salt diets can lead to lupus and other autoimmune diseases. So between the high blood pressures and strokes and the autoimmune diseases, you don't wanna be eating a high salt diet. Now people say, well, we stopped using salt shakers at the table, we're okay. Turns out that that's not where most of the salt comes from in the standard American diet. It comes from the processed foods and you can't control it. With the salt shaker at the table, you can at least control how much salt you're putting on your food. But it's already in the spaghetti sauce at the Italian restaurant. It's in the soy sauce in the Asian restaurant. Now it's in the frozen dinners. It's the processed food that contains all this sodium. Even the veggie hot dogs, they're full of salt. And so that's why you wanna, again, as much as possible, stay out of restaurants if you can, at least hold it to a minimum. Restaurant food is full of salt and sugar and fat, tastes good, but it's really not healthy for you. And certainly minimize those processed foods. Don't be bringing back the veggie hot dogs, et cetera, et cetera. And if you think you need a little bit of salt, turns out that a pinch, literally a pinch of salt, it's about an eighth of a teaspoon on the surface of your veggies at the table because the salt crystals land on the surface of the vegetables. When you eat it, you get this big salty taste hit for very little actual sodium. That really is the best way to get salts in your diet is a pinch of salt on your vegetables, a pinch at three meals a day. I don't know how much you'd use at breakfast, but certainly at lunch and dinner, a little bit of salt or a little spray of tamari sauce will give you just a couple hundred milligrams of sodium. That's a safe amount of salt to use there for flavoring. So just put a little sprinkle on your food if you want some at the table, but it's to stay away from the processed foods. Another reason, you know, as we say, whole food plant-based has become like one word there, whole food, you know, without all this extra salt and sugar and fat added to it there. So stay away from the processed foods as much as you can, a little bit you can get away with, and add a little bit of salt to the table and you ought to do okay. But these high salt diets are dangerous. They lead to strokes and autoimmune diseases. Now, can you talk to me a little bit about genes and the part that they play in our health and our, you know, our life essentially? So a lot of people talk about genes being like, oh, I have genes of this in my family or genes in that in my family. My understanding is that with the proper diet, it really doesn't matter as much as people think it does, but I'd love to hear your thoughts. Absolutely. When I went to medical school in the dark ages there, we were taught, you know, your genes are your fate. You know, if you've got genes for heart disease in your family, you're going to get heart disease and there's nothing you can do about it. And this, you know, this is imprinted. And you may well have these genes, but who knew back then, but we know now that you may have the genes for a particular disease, but whether those genes actually manifest in your particular body largely depends on the food you are flowing through your cells. Why? Because within minutes of eating anything, molecules of that food are flowing through every cell in your body where your DNA lies unfolded. These are your genes. And the food molecules wash over your DNA and they turn genes on, they turn genes off, they induce enzymes, they shut enzymes down. In this information age, we can't be amazed or surprised that food brings in not only nutrients, it brings in information. And every meal changes us on a genetic molecular level. This is the science of epigenetics. And that is external factors that turn genes on or turn genes off. And yes, there are other factors, stress levels, how much sleep you get, daylight, et cetera, they can affect your genes. But by far, it's the food, it's the food, it's the food that influences our gene expressions more than anything. And again, you eat a bunch of meat and dairy and oil and sugars day after day after day, you're gonna turn on genes that ignite inflammation and set off cancer growth. And the converse, you may have these genes, but if what's flowing through your tissues day after day are beans and greens and fruits and vegetables, that gives the chemical message to your DNA, to your genes of calm down, everything's okay, this is a natural food. And many of these diseases that people have a propensity to just don't show up in their bodies. So we have tremendous control over the actual disease or health status in our body, largely again, depending on the food we choose to flow through our tissues with every meal. So we've got a lot of power, your genes are not your fate. As they say, when your genes may load the gun, but it's your diet and your lifestyle that pulls the trigger about whether those genes manifest as disease largely depends on the food you're flowing through your cells on a daily basis. So for.
