Please provide a detailed summary while keeping the following context in mind: 
In this detailed summary, Dr. Klaper emphasizes the importance of obtaining fats from whole plant foods rather than extracted oils. When oils like olive oil are consumed, the fats are separated from the fiber and concentrated into a liquid form, making it easier for the body to absorb large amounts of fat at once. This can lead to imbalances and potential health issues. Dr. Klaper recommends obtaining fats from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives, as they come packaged with fiber and other beneficial compounds, allowing the body to properly process and utilize fats. He advises a moderate intake of fats, typically ranging from 10-20% of daily caloric intake, although individual needs may vary. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.   Additionally, Dr. Klaper discusses the effects of a high salt diet. While some sodium is necessary for the body, excessive salt intake can stiffen artery walls, increase fluid retention, raise blood pressure, and potentially lead to heart attacks, strokes, and autoimmune diseases. He advises minimizing processed foods, which often contain high levels of sodium, and adding a pinch of salt to food at the table for flavor.   Regarding genes and their impact on health, Dr. Klaper explains that while individuals may have genetic predispositions to certain diseases, their manifestation largely depends on the food and lifestyle choices they make. The food molecules that flow through the body affect gene expression and can either turn on or off specific genes. Eating a diet rich in plant-based whole foods can positively influence gene expression and reduce the risk of disease, even for individuals with genetic predispositions. Ultimately, Dr. Klaper emphasizes that individuals have control over their health outcomes by choosing a diet and lifestyle that support optimal gene expression.

someone like yourself, who's been, you know, fighting the good fight now for over 40 years, how do you feel about where we're going in this journey? I mean, there's a little bit difference than it was in the 80s. So what's your thoughts on that? Right, I'll say thank you, not only for that question and call me a cockeyed optimist, but I'm feeling very positive because of you and all your colleagues in the media and as internet educators who are bringing Dr. Ornish and McDougall and Esselstyn and all those plant-based docs to get this word out. Because at this point, it's a matter of education and it's a matter of turning on the light in people's heads. You know, it's like turning an ocean liner, but the old the hundredth monkey phenomenon, where I think we're at monkey number 94 or so, we're getting to that point where people, oh yeah, yeah, I heard you can reverse diabetes with a plant-based diet. Oh yeah, I heard you can reverse high blood pressure with a plant-based diet. It's just becoming common knowledge. It's in the zeitgeist, as you said, thanks to you and your colleagues doing podcasts like this. So for that reason, plus again, where we're trying to create a whole generation of medical students and all the allied health professionals, the dentists and the nurses and the pharmacists and the physical therapists, they're all dealing with people with nutrition-based diseases and all the health professions need to open to the plant-based message. And if we do, we're gonna have a healthier society and a much more efficient true healthcare system. So I'm modestly optimistic. And if we had another 50 or a hundred years, no problem, man, we're gonna have a plant-based society in a century or so. Unfortunately, we don't have that kind of time, especially with climate change, which is also driven by our animal flesh-based diet. And that adds an urgency to this. The ice caps are melting because we're cutting down the forest to make cropland and grazing land for beef and feeding most of the food we grow down the gullets of animals to create flesh-based foods that cause diseases here. If we change to a plant-based diet that will free up so much land that the forest will come back. And as the trees grow, they take carbon dioxide out of the air and turn it into solid wood and it reverses global warming and everything will heal with a plant-based diet. And we've got to get on with it for that reason. So I'm hoping we've got enough time on a climate-wise level. But as far as nutrition goes, there are some powerful forces, not the least of which is the economics. The kind of medicine we're practicing now, it's Band-Aid medicine with coronary artery bypasses that don't cure the patient with the stents and the autoimmune suppressants. Nobody's really getting healthier and it's bankrupting our system. A plant-based diet will see people getting truly healthy and that will free up money to fix the roads and send kids to college and put internet in everybody's house. Everybody wins with a whole food plant-based diet. So every place I see it getting more and more accepted makes me more and more optimistic. So nothing to do, but keep on fighting the good fight as you well know. You are a cockeyed optimist, I have to say. There's some grim signs out there. There's some scary signs and you can easily get depressed, I agree. But you just got to focus on the progress we're making and try and make it happen fast. We owe it to the kids. We owe it to the animals. We owe it to the earth. We owe it to our future. Absolutely. And look, that there's an entire industry wrapped around faux meats now. And this kind of, that's a sign. Absolutely. I mean, it's just that one company. It's an entire industry. They're all seeing it. Even the meat companies are starting to make plant-based meats, even Tyson. And the milk. Oh yeah, they're all, everyone's making, even Trader Joe's has their own. So it's that and the plant-based milks have been a big, I mean, that's exploded. Exploded. That's true. Like I say, you can't keep a half pound in a cloth bag for very long. You know, the point comes out, you know? Exactly. That's happening with the plant-based foods. And the thing that I always find fascinating about plant-based diets and when people change, because I've had over the years influenced a few people to change over, is that how quickly you feel the difference. Oh yes. Within a week or two. It's not like, oh, months later, I felt it. No, no. Days. Absolutely. Days. Days you feel it. Absolutely. It's remarkable how fast, you know, you'll start feeling different. And, you know, I sleep around five or six hours a day, sometimes a little longer. I can't, my body won't let me sleep longer. I wish I could sleep those 12 hours I did when I was a teenager. But you're right. Your energy levels are higher. Absolutely. You just feel better. And as you get older, these things become more important. You know? They sure do. Next week, I turned 75. Wow. And I feel like I did when I was 40. I don't feel much different. I need, you know, very little sleep like you do. And I attribute it to a whole food plant-based diet. And I really urge people, adopt it while you still can. It'll pay off dividends all through your life. Now, I'm going to ask you a couple of questions I ask all of my guests. What is your mission in this life? My mission as a physician is to help my colleagues open to the power and the beauty and the truth of a whole food plant-based diet as a therapeutic tool to reverse the diseases they are spending the majority of their professional life treating. But in doing so, as through podcasts like this, I wanted to alert the general public for the same reason, to help them change. And as they do, the doctors will. You know, say like our politicians, when we change the state of our heads, we'll change the heads of our states, you know? And the same thing with medicine. As the patients start demanding, doctor, what should I be eating? You know, it's going to force the doctors to open to these nutritional truths. So I'm trying to create a generation of nutritionally aware physicians and health practitioners. So that's my particular mission, but we're all basically on the same mission to create a plant-based world. And what is the ultimate purpose of life? Oh, to love, of course. We're here to love. I mean, we're the only planet that we know on the planet where there's beings around that can love. can love each other. And it includes the animal kingdom. You take a baby calf away from its mother, you see the power of the love of this creature for its offspring. When you if you love you put love into your garden, it grows beautifully and it will feed you the food appears and beauty, beautiful flowers appear, you take your love away. And the plants who wither and the weeds grow. The love makes every every good thing on the planet happen. And so we're here to love and to mentor. Well, we're the we're the keepers of the garden. We were given this beautiful garden of a planet. Now we're the we're the tenders of the garden. And we're here to keep things healthy and and make it a place where our children can grow up safe, happy and able to love even more. So love is the purpose.
