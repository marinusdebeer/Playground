Make the following summaries flow as one long and detailed article: 
Dr. Michael Klaper, a plant-based physician, discusses the importance of nutrition in our overall health and well-being. He explains that food molecules flow through every cell in our body and can turn genes on or off, induce or shut down enzymes. He partnered with Mindvalley to offer free masterclasses on mind, body, soul, relationships, and conscious entrepreneurship. 

Dr. Klaper discusses his own journey to a plant-based diet, starting with his frustration as a general practitioner seeing his patients get sicker and having heart attacks and strokes without knowing how to help them. He decided to become an anesthesiologist but realized that the fatty deposits causing heart attacks and strokes were reversible with a plant-based diet. He adopted a whole food, plant-based diet and experienced significant improvements in his health, including weight loss, normalized blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. This inspired him to go back to general practice and help his patients adopt a plant-based diet to achieve similar results. 

He explains that doctors do not receive adequate nutrition education in medical school, and as a result, they often overlook the role of diet in disease prevention and management. He believes that the influence of the meat and dairy industries, as well as the focus on drugs and surgeries, contribute to this lack of nutrition knowledge among doctors. However, he is hopeful that the new generation of medical students, who have access to documentaries and information on plant-based diets, will bring about a change in the medical establishment's understanding and treatment of nutrition. Dr. Klaper is actively working on educating medical students and professors through the Moving Medicine Forward initiative, which aims to incorporate nutrition into medical school curricula and promote evidence-based research on the benefits of plant-based diets. He believes that as more people become educated about the benefits of plant-based diets and as the plant-based food industry continues to improve, the shift towards a plant-based lifestyle will become more mainstream. He also addresses the misconception that plant-based diets are restrictive and highlights the variety and deliciousness of plant-based cuisine. Overall, Dr. Klaper emphasizes the power of nutrition in preventing and reversing chronic diseases and advocates for its inclusion in medical education.

The lipase enzymes break down the fats in the olive, allowing for proper digestion and absorption. This slow and natural process allows the body to utilize fats in a healthy way. On the other hand, when you consume extracted oils like olive oil, the fats are separated from the fiber and concentrated into a liquid form. This makes it much easier for the body to absorb large amounts of fat at once, leading to imbalances and potential health issues.

Dr. Klaper advises against the use of extracted oils, including olive oil, as they lack the fiber and other nutrients found in whole plant foods. He recommends obtaining fats from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives, as they come packaged with fiber and other beneficial compounds. These whole plant foods provide a balanced and natural source of fats that the body can properly process and utilize.

In terms of quantity, Dr. Klaper suggests a moderate intake of fats, typically ranging from 10-20% of daily caloric intake. This allows for a sufficient intake of essential fatty acids while keeping overall fat intake in check. However, it is important to note that individual needs may vary based on factors such as activity level, age, and underlying health conditions. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance.

In summary, Dr. Klaper emphasizes the importance of obtaining fats from whole plant foods rather than extracted oils. He recommends a moderate intake of fats, obtained from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives, to ensure a balanced and healthy diet.

Additionally, Dr. Klaper discusses the effects of a high salt diet. While some sodium is necessary for the body, excessive salt intake can stiffen artery walls, increase fluid retention, raise blood pressure, and potentially lead to heart attacks, strokes, and autoimmune diseases. He advises minimizing processed foods, which often contain high levels of sodium, and adding a pinch of salt to food at the table for flavor. 

Regarding genes and their impact on health, Dr. Klaper explains that while individuals may have genetic predispositions to certain diseases, their manifestation largely depends on the food and lifestyle choices they make. The food molecules that flow through the body affect gene expression and can either turn on or off specific genes. Eating a diet rich in plant-based whole foods can positively influence gene expression and reduce the risk of disease, even for individuals with genetic predispositions. Ultimately, Dr. Klaper emphasizes that individuals have control over their health outcomes by choosing a diet and lifestyle that support optimal gene expression.
