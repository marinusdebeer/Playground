Dr. Michael Klaper, a plant-based physician, discusses the importance of nutrition in our overall health and well-being. He explains that food molecules flow through every cell in our body and can turn genes on or off, induce or shut down enzymes. He partnered with Mindvalley to offer free masterclasses on mind, body, soul, relationships, and conscious entrepreneurship. 

Dr. Klaper discusses his own journey to a plant-based diet, starting with his frustration as a general practitioner seeing his patients get sicker and having heart attacks and strokes without knowing how to help them. He decided to become an anesthesiologist but realized that the fatty deposits causing heart attacks and strokes were reversible with a plant-based diet. He adopted a whole food, plant-based diet and experienced significant improvements in his health, including weight loss, normalized blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. This inspired him to go back to general practice and help his patients adopt a plant-based diet to achieve similar results. 

He explains that doctors do not receive adequate nutrition education in medical school, and as a result, they often overlook the role of diet in disease prevention and management. He believes that the influence of the meat and dairy industries, as well as the focus on drugs and surgeries, contribute to this lack of nutrition knowledge among doctors. However, he is hopeful that the new generation of medical students, who have access to documentaries and information on plant-based diets, will bring about a change in the medical establishment's understanding and treatment of nutrition. Dr. Klaper is actively working on educating medical students and professors through the Moving Medicine Forward initiative, which aims to incorporate nutrition into medical school curricula and promote evidence-based research on the benefits of plant-based diets. He believes that as more people become educated about the benefits of plant-based diets and as the plant-based food industry continues to improve, the shift towards a plant-based lifestyle will become more mainstream. He also addresses the misconception that plant-based diets are restrictive and highlights the variety and deliciousness of plant-based cuisine. Overall, Dr. Klaper emphasizes the power of nutrition in preventing and reversing chronic diseases and advocates for its inclusion in medical education.
