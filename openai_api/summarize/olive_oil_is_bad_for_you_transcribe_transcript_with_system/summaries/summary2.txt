The lipase enzymes break down the fats in the olive, allowing for proper digestion and absorption. This slow and natural process allows the body to utilize fats in a healthy way. On the other hand, when you consume extracted oils like olive oil, the fats are separated from the fiber and concentrated into a liquid form. This makes it much easier for the body to absorb large amounts of fat at once, leading to imbalances and potential health issues.

Dr. Klaper advises against the use of extracted oils, including olive oil, as they lack the fiber and other nutrients found in whole plant foods. He recommends obtaining fats from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives, as they come packaged with fiber and other beneficial compounds. These whole plant foods provide a balanced and natural source of fats that the body can properly process and utilize.

In terms of quantity, Dr. Klaper suggests a moderate intake of fats, typically ranging from 10-20% of daily caloric intake. This allows for a sufficient intake of essential fatty acids while keeping overall fat intake in check. However, it is important to note that individual needs may vary based on factors such as activity level, age, and underlying health conditions. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance.

In summary, Dr. Klaper emphasizes the importance of obtaining fats from whole plant foods rather than extracted oils. He recommends a moderate intake of fats, obtained from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives, to ensure a balanced and healthy diet.
