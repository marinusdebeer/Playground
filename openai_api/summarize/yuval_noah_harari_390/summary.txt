In this conversation, historian and author Yuval Noah Harari articulates his belief that the success of human societies and civilizations is largely rooted in our imaginative abilities, and our shared belief in collective fictions or stories. Harari posits that these narratives have the capacity to incite wars and sacrifices, yet they lack the ability to feel or suffer - a trait Harari regards as the ultimate reality. He cautions that understanding potential suffering and weighing its cost against benefits is of utmost importance.

Harari engages with the ideas surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), acknowledging the possibility that AI might one day develop the ability to feel or suffer while urging caution in the advancement and use of such technologies. He emphatically argues against using AI to manipulate human emotions and advocates for it to be illegal for AI to impersonate humans.

Harari delves into discussions on humanism, communism, and fascism, as well as the current political scenario in Israel. He asserts that unchecked governmental power threatens democracy and could lead to instability. He also discusses the insidious class systems in Israel, but resists comparison with apartheid.

Further in the talk, Harari discusses potential resolutions to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. He transitions into discussions on the development of AI, expressing fears about an AI-assisted creation of a human race that is high on intelligence but lacks compassion and depth.

Harari touches on the threats posed by conspiracy theories as offshoots of legitimate fears of loss of control in a complex world, though he believes the real threats derive from AI, bioengineering, and climate change. Finally, Harari takes on personal matters, discussing his experiences of coming out as gay, the narratives that restrain people's authenticity, and the universal fear of death. He concludes that life is a series of sensations and emotions rather than a broad narrative.
