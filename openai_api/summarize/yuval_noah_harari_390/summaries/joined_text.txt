In this conversation with historian and author Yuval Noah Harari, he discusses his belief in the influence of imagination and stories in human cooperation and societal organisation. According to Harari, the secret of human success is our collective ability, our ability to cooperate flexibly in very large numbers. He credits this ability to stories or fiction, claiming that any large scale human cooperation is based on a shared fictional story. 

These stories, he argues, have the power to make us sacrifice lives and even cause wars, but are unable to feel or suffer themselves. Thus, Harari considers consciousness, or the capacity to feel and suffer, as the ultimate reality. He believes that attention should be paid to the potential suffering an action might cause and whether the potential benefits outweigh this cost. 

Regarding artificial intelligence, Harari is open to the possibility that AI may one day become capable of feeling and suffering. However, he advises caution in the development and application of such technology, warning against AI systems designed to manipulate human emotions and believes that it should be illegal for AI to pretend to be human. 

Harari also highlights the importance of truth, defining it as any experience of suffering. He comments on the powerThe speaker discusses the role of humanism and the rise of both communism and fascism, highlighting the damage they both caused due to prioritizing a single interest above all others; class in the case of communism and the nation in the case of fascism. They sacrificed truth and beauty and resulted in the deaths of many people. The conversation then segued into Israel's current political climate, where the speaker argues that the Prime Minister's government threatens the nation's democracy by taking over the Supreme Court and thereby gaining unchecked power, which he warns could set off instability in the Middle East and beyond. When asked about achieving peace in this region, he states that motivation is the main obstacle, noting that both leaders and the people seem to lack it. The speaker also mentions a de facto three-class state system that exists in Israel, where the three classes are Jews with full rights, some Arab Israelis with limited rights, and other Arabs with very few rights. He disagrees with comparing this situation with apartheid in South Africa, however, due to key differences like the fact that black South Africans wanted equality within their country, not its destruction or separation into different states.The text discusses the potential future of a one-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians. The author notes that while such a solution seems unlikely given the current state of affairs, history has shown that nations and groups that once fiercely opposed each other can eventually unify. This is exemplified by the unification of warring German states into one country, as well as the union of England and Scotland. 

The discussion then turns to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The author asserts that peace could be achieved swiftly if Putin chooses to withdraw Russian forces. This is followed by an exploration of the power and importance of conversation in resolving conflicts and maintaining democracy. 

The conversation moves onto the threat of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly if used unethically. The author expresses concern about AI being used to create a human race that is more intelligent and stronger but lacks compassion and spiritual depth.

The text also addresses conspiracy theories and the dangers they pose, despite often embodying legitimate fears about a loss of control in an increasingly complex world. However, the author suggests these fears are misplaced; the real threat lies with more diffuse forces related to AI, bioengineering, and climate change. 

The author concludes by expressing their belief that individuals do have the power to make the world a little better and that everyone should strive to make allies and work together against common threats. The discussion ends by reflecting on the rapid development of AI and the potential dangers it poses, particularly if we lose control of it.The transcript describes a conversation with Yuval Noah Harari, a renowned philosopher and author, discussing the future of artificial intelligence (AI). He starts by asking Harari how he feels about AI potentially surpassing human writing capabilities and Harari acknowledges that this is possible. He has seen AI being instructed to write like him and has been impressed with the results. He accepts the possibility that in the future, AI could also surpass humans in generating content.

Harari also discusses the nature of intelligence and storytelling, which he regards as powerful human capabilities. However, he also highlights introspection, compassion, and nonverbal experiences as significant aspects of humanity. He also discusses the importance of maintaining mindfulness and being cautious about what information we feed our minds. 

Harari also discusses how he views problems in the world, first taking the time to disconnect and meditate. He tries not to be fully engaged with his thoughts, preferring to observe what’s happening within him. Harari also emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and change as no one can predict the future. 

Discussing his coming out as gay, Harari explores the power of stories and social conventions. He discusses how these narratives can often restrain individuals from being true to themselves. He also mentions how he benefited from the hard work of previous generations who fought for gay liberation and feminist movements. 

Finally, discussing the matter of death, Harari agrees that everyone fears death and many other fears stem from this central worry. He believes that fear of death is a deep-seated worry that’s hard to maintain in our consciousness. Harari rounds up the discussion by stating that life is not a story, but rather a series of sensations and emotions. The real question should be the observation of suffering, where it comes from, and how we respond to it.
