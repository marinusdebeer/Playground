The speaker discusses the role of humanism and the rise of both communism and fascism, highlighting the damage they both caused due to prioritizing a single interest above all others; class in the case of communism and the nation in the case of fascism. They sacrificed truth and beauty and resulted in the deaths of many people. The conversation then segued into Israel's current political climate, where the speaker argues that the Prime Minister's government threatens the nation's democracy by taking over the Supreme Court and thereby gaining unchecked power, which he warns could set off instability in the Middle East and beyond. When asked about achieving peace in this region, he states that motivation is the main obstacle, noting that both leaders and the people seem to lack it. The speaker also mentions a de facto three-class state system that exists in Israel, where the three classes are Jews with full rights, some Arab Israelis with limited rights, and other Arabs with very few rights. He disagrees with comparing this situation with apartheid in South Africa, however, due to key differences like the fact that black South Africans wanted equality within their country, not its destruction or separation into different states.
