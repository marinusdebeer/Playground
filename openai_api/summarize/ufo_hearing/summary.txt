The subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), or unidentified flying objects (UFOs), was attended by several members of Congress and witnesses who shared their experiences with UAPs. Witnesses included a former Navy pilot, a retired Navy Commander, and a former senior intelligence officer. They raised concerns about the lack of transparency from government institutions regarding UAPs and called for the release of classified information to the public. 

The witnesses discussed the stigma attached to reporting UAP sightings and proposed the creation of a secure reporting system for pilots. They also talked about potential security concerns over advanced sensors used for identifying objects and suggested that UAP-related information from the last 15-20 years should be publicly available unless it would reveal a specific national security vulnerability.

Witness Mr. Fravor recalled his experience with a UAP event in 2004. Mr. Gresh, a former intelligence officer, claimed that information about UAPs is being hidden. Both witnesses stressed the need for a systematic reporting system for UAP sightings.

The witnesses highlighted the unknown nature and superior technology of UAPs, creating potential national security concerns. They also revealed a lack of consensus within the U.S. government on UAP sightings and stressed the need for a centralized data collection process and the assurance of protection for those who share their UAP experiences.

Additionally, there were references to classified information, with suggestions for further briefings in a secure environment. One significant revelation was the mention of the U.S. government's possession of potentially "non-human" crafts and "biologics," although no specific details were shared publicly.

The members of the subcommittee concluded with a commitment to more government transparency on the subject, further investigation of UAP phenomena, and the need for potential legislation concerning information disclosures about UAPs. There was also mention of the media's role in shedding light on this topic further.
