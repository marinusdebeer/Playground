In a subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), several members of Congress, including Mr. Burchard of Tennessee, Miss Luna Florida, Mr. Getza Florida, Mr. Burleson of Missouri, Mrs. Ocasio-Cortez in New York, and Mr. Ogles of Tennessee, were invited to participate. The members discussed the presence and potential risks of UAPs, expressing concerns over the lack of transparency from government institutions. Witnesses included Lieutenant Ryan Graves, former Navy pilot; David grush, former senior intelligence officer at the National geospatial Intelligence Agency; and retired Navy Commander David Fraber. The witnesses shared their own encounters with UAPs and urged for greater governmental transparency, arguing that unexplained sightings of these phenomena were widespread and should not be dismissed or covered up. The witnesses called for more investigation and the release of classified information to the public. Several Congress members also criticized the lack of preparation in handling UAP-related events, as well as the claim that the intelligence community was withholding information from the public. The hearing concluded with a reaffirmed commitment to objective inquiry and a call for more government efficiency and openness regarding UAPs.
