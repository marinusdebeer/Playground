The witnesses discussed the stigma against discussing unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) sightings and the need for a system where pilots can report such events without fear of professional repercussions. It was noted that management or physical checks could lead to repercussions, calling for a secure system to reduce concerns among aircrew. A dearth of data has resulted due to limited reporting systems for UAP sightings. The witnesses also discussed potential security concerns regarding advanced sensors used to identify objects, expressing curiosity about how security classification guidelines categorise such topics. It was proposed that UAP-related information from 15 to 20 years ago should be made publicly available unless it reveals a specific national security vulnerability.

Mr. Fravor recounted the reporting process following a UAP event he encountered in 2004 as a pilot, the only such event he had experienced. All witnesses agreed that UAPs could pose a potential national security threat due to their superior technology, mentioning the need for a centralized location for reporting and processing UAP information.

Mr. Gresh, a former intelligence official, claimed that information about UAPs is being hidden. He also expressed concern for safety in commercial aviation, and noted that he had received threats for coming forward with his testimony.

Mr. Graves and Mr. Fravor emphasized the need for a systematic reporting system for UAP sightings and suggested making it available for civilians as well, focusing on sensor-centric operation for objectivity. They also highlighted how these UAPs exhibit maneuvers and speed beyond current technological understanding, suggesting potential extraterrestrial origin.

Internally, in the US government, there is still debate and ambiguity about UAP sightings, revealing a lack of unified understanding about the phenomenon. The witnesses stressed the need for transparency and centralization in data collection and processing, along with protection for those sharing their experiences.
