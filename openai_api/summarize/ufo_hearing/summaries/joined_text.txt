In a subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), several members of Congress, including Mr. Burchard of Tennessee, Miss Luna Florida, Mr. Getza Florida, Mr. Burleson of Missouri, Mrs. Ocasio-Cortez in New York, and Mr. Ogles of Tennessee, were invited to participate. The members discussed the presence and potential risks of UAPs, expressing concerns over the lack of transparency from government institutions. Witnesses included Lieutenant Ryan Graves, former Navy pilot; David grush, former senior intelligence officer at the National geospatial Intelligence Agency; and retired Navy Commander David Fraber. The witnesses shared their own encounters with UAPs and urged for greater governmental transparency, arguing that unexplained sightings of these phenomena were widespread and should not be dismissed or covered up. The witnesses called for more investigation and the release of classified information to the public. Several Congress members also criticized the lack of preparation in handling UAP-related events, as well as the claim that the intelligence community was withholding information from the public. The hearing concluded with a reaffirmed commitment to objective inquiry and a call for more government efficiency and openness regarding UAPs.The witnesses discussed the stigma against discussing unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) sightings and the need for a system where pilots can report such events without fear of professional repercussions. It was noted that management or physical checks could lead to repercussions, calling for a secure system to reduce concerns among aircrew. A dearth of data has resulted due to limited reporting systems for UAP sightings. The witnesses also discussed potential security concerns regarding advanced sensors used to identify objects, expressing curiosity about how security classification guidelines categorise such topics. It was proposed that UAP-related information from 15 to 20 years ago should be made publicly available unless it reveals a specific national security vulnerability.

Mr. Fravor recounted the reporting process following a UAP event he encountered in 2004 as a pilot, the only such event he had experienced. All witnesses agreed that UAPs could pose a potential national security threat due to their superior technology, mentioning the need for a centralized location for reporting and processing UAP information.

Mr. Gresh, a former intelligence official, claimed that information about UAPs is being hidden. He also expressed concern for safety in commercial aviation, and noted that he had received threats for coming forward with his testimony.

Mr. Graves and Mr. Fravor emphasized the need for a systematic reporting system for UAP sightings and suggested making it available for civilians as well, focusing on sensor-centric operation for objectivity. They also highlighted how these UAPs exhibit maneuvers and speed beyond current technological understanding, suggesting potential extraterrestrial origin.

Internally, in the US government, there is still debate and ambiguity about UAP sightings, revealing a lack of unified understanding about the phenomenon. The witnesses stressed the need for transparency and centralization in data collection and processing, along with protection for those sharing their experiences.
The committee hearing was focused on discussing the topic of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). It involved various expert testimonials discussing their knowledge and experiences. While the term extraterrestrial was avoided, the panel did discuss "non-human origin" phenomena and acknowledged a historical pattern of UAP sightings. It was stated that numerous pilots allegedly get physically injured from encounters with UAPs, yet no specifics were provided. 

The key witnesses referred to classified information that they could not discuss publicly. They also asserted that there was a stigma associated with reporting UAP encounters which affected the level of reported sightings. The committee was advised that there was information concerning the issue that they would be allowed access to if they had the appropriate security classifications. There were also assertions that high-level officials have unlawfully withheld information from Congress stemming from the 2019 classification guidelines for UAPs, leading to reduced transparency for the American people. 

One significant revelation was mention of a U.S. government possession of potentially "non-human" craft and the retrieval of "biologics" from these craft. However, again, specifics weren't provided publicly. The witnesses suggested a continuing and deeper investigation of such UAP phenomena. 

Multiple members recommended further briefings with the key witness in a secure environment in order to gain a fuller understanding of the phenomena and ascertain any national security threats posed by UAPs.This detailed summary documents a government hearing discussing the sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) otherwise known as unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The hearing was attended by members of Congress and several key witnesses including Mr. Faver, who describes sighting a UFO in 2004, Mr. Graves, a pilot who has encountered UAPs during his career, and Mr. Grush, an employee of the Department of Defense with experience analyzing UAP sightings. 

Discussion was largely around the need for robust reporting systems for both military and commercial pilots, as well as greater transparency and continued investigation into sightings of UAPs. Witnesses and congress members also emphasized the need for continued bipartisanship on this topic. Mr. Faver, Mr. Graves, and Mr. Grush stated their willingness to participate in further, classified sessions of inquiry. 

Concerns were raised relating to the national security implications of UAPs and the capacity to distinguish between potentially alien technologies versus foreign military capabilities. Committee staff were also asked to provide details of possible violations of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 

The congress members and witnesses requested tangible facts and non-speculative reporting moving forward, with encouragement for the media to take an active role in investigating and reporting on the subject. Also mentioned was the potential need for legislation pertaining to information disclosures about UAPs and the possibility of creating a smoother process to bring such information to other committees. 

A significant point was raised around a potential treaty that mentions UAPs; an unclassified treaty signed in 1971 between the US and Russia to reduce the risk of nuclear war recognises UAPs, implying a joint understanding and the potential for safety measures against escalatory situations involving UAPs. 

Both witnesses and members recognized the severity and potential implications of these encounters, highlighting the need for continued exploration and public transparency on the matter of UAP sightings.
