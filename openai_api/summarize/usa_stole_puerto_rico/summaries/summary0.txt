In this video, Johnny Harris provides a historical overview of how the US acquired Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory, and detailed the exploitation and suppression of its people over time. Puerto Rico was taken from Spanish control in 1898 after the US won the Spanish-American War. Instead of granting the colonies they captured their independence as they had promised, the US took them over, essentially becoming their new colonial power. The video details how Puerto Rico was systematically transformed into a source of cheap labour and raw materials, especially sugar, for the US. The local Puerto Rican population was deliberately impoverished and their local culture and language suppressed. The status of Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory meant that it was under US control, but its residents did not have all the rights associated with being full American citizens. 

In response to these conditions, a movement for independence emerged in the territory, led by Pedro Albizu Campos. Despite constant harassment and suppression by US authorities, including through extensive surveillance and intimidation tactics (known as ‘the Carpetas’), the movement persisted. However, their attempts at rebellion were brutally suppressed, and the movement's efforts to bring international attention to Puerto Rico's plight largely failed. To this day, Puerto Rico remains an unincorporated territory of the US, with all the inherent contradictions and problems that status implies.

Harris concludes by acknowledging Puerto Rico's immense contributions to American culture and life, but notes that its history and current status are not widely recognized or understood by many Americans. He also highlights the continuing debate among Puerto Ricans about the benefits and drawbacks of their connection to the US.
