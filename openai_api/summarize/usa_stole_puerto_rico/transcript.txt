- [Johnny] It's easy to forget
that the US still has colonies,
(dramatic music)
but we don't actually use the word colony,
we prefer words
like unincorporated
territory or commonwealth.
These are places where people
are subject to US rule,
but don't enjoy the full
rights that other Americans do.
I wanna tell you about
one of them, Puerto Rico.
When you're in Puerto Rico,
you're not just in a vacation paradise,
you are in a part of the United States.
It feels like the United States,
but it also feels distinctly different.
This feeling, this limbo state
didn't happen by accident.
In fact, it's perhaps the best example
of the lengths the United States
has gone to hold onto land.
So let me show you how
the US kept their colony
in the Caribbean using brute force,
spying and the abuse of land and people.
This is how the US stole Puerto Rico.
Pause the video really quick.
I need to just tell you something,
which is that about three years ago,
I started seeing a therapist
because I was kind of not
in a happy place in my life
and needed to talk to somebody
and it kind of changed my life.
It really changed my life.
I'm telling you this
because it has to do with
who's sponsoring today's video.
Thank you Better help for sponsoring
today's video and the channel generally.
I didn't grow up going to
therapy or really understood,
I sort of thought it was only
for if like I had some big mental illness
and I needed help, I go see a therapist.
What I've learned is
that therapy is actually something
that I think we all need.
In the same way that we all need exercise
for our physical bodies,
we need help with our
mental selves as well
and that is what therapy can do,
and better help is a platform
that makes it really easy
to find a good therapist
and start communicating
with them immediately.
With Better Help, you sign up,
you take a quick quiz,
and then they match you
with a licensed therapist
in their giant network
of tens of thousands of therapists
that are all over the place.
It's not limited to your
geographic location.
Once you're connected to a therapist,
you can very quickly start
communicating however you want.
You can do text message
sessions, you can do video call,
you can do phone call.
Finding a therapist the
traditional way, I've found,
is a much more difficult
and arduous process,
which when you're looking for a therapist,
you don't want any friction.
It's not a very fun thing to do.
With better help, if your
therapist isn't a good fit,
you can switch to a new one for free.
In the end, Better Help is trying
to make therapy more accessible
to all of us so that we can
learn more about our minds,
how our minds and our emotions work
and hopefully live better lives.

And now let's dive back into Puerto Rico.
(soft music)
Okay, so it's 1898
and the Spanish Empire looks
like this, but it's faltering.
A lot of its colonies are
fighting for independence.
The United States gets involved
and allies with a lot of
these independence fighters.
They say they wanna
liberate these colonies
and so they get into the war and they win.
But instead of liberating
Spain's colonies,
they just take them for themselves.
And one of those colonies was Puerto Rico.
And so on an ordinary
Tuesday from the late 1800's,
there was a quiet
ceremony that takes place
on the governor's balcony in San Juan.
After 400 years of Spanish rule,
Puerto Rico, this island in the Caribbean,
is simply passed from
one ruler to the next,
and this begins an
unprecedented experiment
in the Caribbean for the United States.
An operation to extract
resources, money, labor,
and military protection from
this small, beautiful island.
They start by passing a
law that gives the US total
political control over the island.
They start appointing American
leaders to govern the island.
Men who don't speak Spanish,
don't know anything about
Puerto Rico or its people.
Most of these leaders treat the assignment
like a business venture.
Like this one guy who when he
was the leader of Puerto Rico,
starts to give public Puerto Rican funds
to American owned
businesses on the island.
Then he stacks the government
with American loyalists
and then eventually he resigns,
but then he returns to the
island to build a sugar kingdom.
Now, with the help of all
of the political officials
that he had appointed,
this company balloons
into the largest global
sugar business on earth.
- [Speaker] And when it's
domino, you are sure it's pure.
- [Johnny] At the same time,
US banks descend on the island,
giving out very predatory loans
and then foreclosing on land,
gobbling it up and turning
it into, you guessed it,
sugar farms.
Puerto Rico is slowly turning
into a sugar island and becoming more
and more dependent on
shipments from the mainland.
The US enacts a new policy that says
that anything going into Puerto
Rico has to be transported
by American ships with American crews.
So of course, this skyrockets
the prices for locals,
which is made worse by the fact
that the US government had devalued
and then outlawed the local currency.
So now every Puerto Rican lost almost half
of their wealth overnight,
and as a part of this push
to lock Puerto Rico in as their colony,
they forbid Spanish in schools
and public institutions.
And so in this very short amount of time,
the US turned Spain's former colony
into this giant sugar farm,
stripping down local identity
and language and culture
in the process and locking the
people under their control.
And then, Congress gives
Puerto Ricans US citizenship,
which conveniently was just in
time for a giant global war.
So Puerto Rican men got sent
to the front lines to fight
for the country that was
in the process of pillaging their island.
By 1922, a series of Supreme Court cases
had solidified Puerto Rico
as a "unincorporated territory"
which is just like word salad
for the US Constitution
doesn't fully apply here.
I mean, think about it,
unincorporated territory,
this intentionally
contradictory jargon that came
from these men hundreds of miles away.
But honestly, the message was very clear.
Puerto Ricans did not look or sound enough
like Americans to actually be
a part of the United States.
(dramatic music)
By the 1930s, big banks owned
60% of these sugar farms,
80% of the tobacco farms, and a 100%
of the railroads and shipping facilities.
At the same time, Puerto
Ricans were being paid less
than 4 cents an hour.
If you put that into today's
currency by inflation,
that's like a dollar an hour.
Poverty and malnutrition
start to grip this island.
All the while the US is turning the island
into an essential military outpost.
See how Puerto Rico juts
out a little bit into the Caribbean?
It served as a strategically
positioned island
to help protect trade routes
and a place where you could refuel ships.
Over time, more and more military bases
and installations start
to pop up on this island.
The US would go on to test thousands
of bombs in Puerto
Rico, leaving behind one
of the most hazardous waste
sites in the United States.
And by the middle of the 1900s,
Puerto Rico really starts to mirror
what the US envisioned,
Puerto Rico, the sugar metropolis.
(dramatic music)
Puerto Rico, the land of low
wages and abundant laborers.
Puerto Rico, the irreplaceable
military outmost.
The empire that build
themselves as the liberators
from Spain is now an overlord
and the locals start fighting back.
(dramatic music)
The fight is led by this
guy, Pedro Albizu Campos.
He's this poor kid who
ends up going to Harvard.
He graduates valedictorian
from Harvard Law School.
He serves the US in World War I
and even helps draft Ireland's
independence constitution.
The guy's kind of a superstar.
Ultimately he returns to his hometown
to attempt the impossible,
Puerto Rican independence.
But soon, Campos would
find himself bouncing
in and out of prison for 25 years.
Things haven't quite escalated.
This movement is just starting.
Campos comes back to Puerto Rico
with the goal of total separation
from the United States,
and people join him.
A lot of people, just every
day ordinary Puerto Ricans,
who are fed up with being
exploited, they join them,
they organize and they call
themselves the nationalists.
They run for office, they go
on strike, and they fight back
against this superpower that
has been exploiting them.
Momentum begins to pick up
and then the dominoes
really start to fall.
There was this American doctor
his name is Cornelius Rhodes, and he went
to Puerto Rico saying he's gonna
do like health research or something.
We know what he really
was doing in thinking
because he wrote this letter,
let me read it to you.
He writes that Puerto Ricans are
"beyond doubt, the dirtiest,
laziest and most degenerate
and peevish race of men ever
to have inhabited this sphere."
And he goes on to say,
that it makes him sick
to "inhabit the same island with them,"
but he doesn't stop there.
He says that Puerto Ricans need
"something to totally exterminate
the entire population."
And then he admits to a crime.
He says, "I have done my
best to further the process
of their extermination by killing
off eight and transplanting
cancer into several more."
I mean, this is bad.
This is, it's really bad.
But for a lot of Puerto
Ricans, this wasn't surprising.
So the staff at the
hospital find this letter
and they send it around to everyone
and it goes out and it goes viral.
And nothing happens to
this guy who has admitted
to murdering a bunch of Puerto Ricans.
Actually, something does happen.
He gets on the front
cover of Time Magazine.
To the nationalists,
this letter confirms something
that they already knew.
It actually wasn't that surprising.
There was an awareness that yes,
America loves Puerto Rico for
their soil and their labor
and their strategic location,
but hates them as people.
So after this letter,
the movement explodes.
(upbeat music)
It gets to the point where
the US and their public
government on the island can
no longer ignore this movement.
Soon a bunch of new officers
are hired and trained and armed
with machine guns and tear gas,
but the nationalists keep fighting.
Then in 1935, police
kill four nationalists
at a university event.
The nationalists retaliate
by killing the police chief.
Then without trial, the
police execute his killer
and arrest, Campos, the
leader of the movement
for plotting to overthrow the government.
Campos is given this rigged
trial with a jury made
up mostly of mainland
Americans, and he gets sentenced
to prison for 10 years.
A few months later, people
are out peacefully protesting
on Palm Sunday and the police
start shooting into the crowd.
Men, women, children and elders
are all clubbed and beaten
to death and shot in the
back as they run away.
19 are killed and over
a hundred are wounded,
but it still doesn't
put down the movement.
The violence only pours fuel on the fire.
Back in Washington DC, they're
starting to get worried
that this independence movement
is just gonna keep building
and they don't want to give up
their island in the Caribbean.
There's still plenty
of money to be made off of
Puerto Rican soil and labor,
not to mention the military
bases that they had there.
So they turn to an extreme measure.
Something that as I learned
about and as we reported on,
has been blowing my mind in a way that I,
I study this stuff a lot.
I look at the behavior of empires.
I look at how they control people.
I've never seen this before.
(dramatic music)
It starts with FBI agents who come
to the island to work with
the police of Puerto Rico.
They have one simple mission,
to spy on anyone who they
deem politically subversive
and to sabotage them
and thus sabotage the
independence movement.
So they spy on everyone.
They spy on the nationalists
who are part of the movement
but also their friends, their partners,
their sexual partners
their business colleagues, their children.
They track down criminal
records and mistresses
and debtors and creditors and photos
and license plate numbers,
school transcripts, and even
the guest list to weddings,
like they got really, really detailed.
They started listening in
on phone calls and intercepting letters.
Everything was fair game.
The idea was to create panopticon,
this idea that they're always watching.
They also started to
cultivate relationships
with a network of informers.
Often the victim's family or friends
or neighbors would get sucked
into this state spying apparatus.
The FBI uses payments and
coercion and manipulation,
which often forces people to turn
on each other, causing divorce
and broken friendship and
fractured communities.
Much of this was done undercover.
Like these FBI agents
would just be dressed
in normal clothes,
but would be constantly
surveilling the people around them.
Oh, and we know
about this because they
documented everything.
(dramatic music)
If you are a person of interest,
you probably had a file.
All of these files, they're
called The Carpetas.
Our story producer Rafaela went
to San Juan to see The Carpetas firsthand.
- So I'm at the General
Archive Building in San Juan
in Puerto Rico to see
the secret surveillance
documents that were collected on thousands
of Puerto Ricans over so many decades.
- [Johnny] After weeks of
work, I finally got to look
at Las Carpetas to see what
was actually in these files.
And it's kind of creepy, I have to say.
You see specific times and
dates and details from meetups,
detailed descriptions
of the locations where
people are just meeting,
all of the names of people involved,
these subgroups that were
potentially supporters
of the independence movement.
You get these highly detailed
physical descriptions
of the people that they were tracking,
their occupation, the model of their car,
their license plate number
and all of their moves,
all of their activities,
what they were doing,
who they were supporting.
And even for those who
moved away from Puerto Rico,
they continued to track them
and knew exactly what apartment
they lived in, in the Bronx.
They speculated about their
nationalistic tendencies.
And then you see these interviews
that agents were having with people close
to the target where their
personal beliefs are revealed,
like one who thought that Puerto Rico
would be repaired with
socialism and independence.
You can see a source telling these agents
that they're afraid that their
friend had become friends
with the leaders of the
Independence movement
and had been inducted in
because of this friendship.
And of course, these informants request
that all this information they're spilling
to the agents "be kept secret."
These agents would even
interview family members.
Like there's this whole
transcript of the agents talking
to the mother of someone who was suspected
to be a part of the independence movement.
Oh yeah.
And in all of these documents
you see an obsession with who had guns.
It's hard to overstate how exhaustive
this spine effort was
and how powerful it was.
The FBI was able to use all
of this information to intimidate
and blackmail and punish
suspected nationalists.
I mean, there are
thousands of these examples
from children being like kidnapped
and put into a helicopter
by the FBI to people being
denied government jobs
all because they had a Carpeta.
At the end of the day,
it was psychological war
against Puerto Ricans
who wanted independence
and it worked horrifically well
in dividing these people and
making them feel powerless,
because they were always being watched
in their most personal of moments.
Oh, and it wasn't just a couple of years,
this lasted for decades.
Eventually it gets to
the point where Campos
and the nationalists
see no other way other
than armed revolution.
In the fall of 1950, the
Nationalists declare Puerto Rico
as an independent nation.
They attempt to seize towns,
to set government buildings
on fire, to cut phone lines.
They try to assassinate the governor
and let's be honest, it's 1950.
Like the United States is easily the most
powerful country to have ever existed.
These people had no chance
of winning against the newly
crowned global superpower.
Their goal was to bring
attention to the world,
to pressure the US to give up its colony.
But instead, the United States responded
by dropping bombs,
the only time in the history
of the United States where
they bombed their own citizens.
One survivor of the revolution
was interviewed five years ago
and said that it was a David
against Goliath situation
and that their leader told
them that they might die,
but that they might succeed,
but that at least they
would've let the world
know about Puerto Rico.
During this revolution,
many of the fighters
wore their Sunday best,
ironed suits and pressed ties,
because they knew they would die.
They had a cause they were fighting for.
In the end, two dozen are killed.
Puerto Rico really didn't have a chance.
President Truman comes
out and is sort of like,
there was an incident in Puerto
Rico, sort of downplays it.
And a couple days later,
two nationalists attempt
to assassinate him.
The world doesn't come
to Puerto Rico's rescue,
and instead the police carry
out a mass arrest throwing
3000 people in jail.
A few years later, four
nationalists open fire
in the chamber of the US Congress.
Campos is arrested again
and this time he's sentenced
to 80 years in prison.
There's evidence that
during this time in prison,
Campos was exposed to
extreme levels of radiation.
The consequences allegedly
gave him a stroke
and left him paralyzed
and unable to speak.
And in the end, the US' wish came true,
they silenced Campos for good.
(dramatic music)
After the squashing of the revolution,
the surveillance program
continued for decades.
In the end, it was a total of 50 years
of state sanctioned spying
on the people of Puerto Rico.
When it all came to light, they estimated
that around a hundred
thousand people had files.
A lot of people in Puerto Rico
knew that this was happening,
but they just knew it in their gut.
They didn't have any real evidence of it.
They didn't realize the sheer scale,
the methodical approach,
that the FBI was taking to spy on them
and to divide them and to
psychologically debase them.
In total, it was 1.8 million
pages of documentation
and many of the victims
of this spying are still alive today.
I think the Carpetas are
a really powerful signal
of how the US kept its
colony in the Caribbean.
They were the cementing
of what the US had done
from the beginning, which is
create a system of reliance
and oppression where people
lived and died under the thumb
of this massive superpower
that was exerting
very, very aggressive
control over these people,
these people who were American citizens.
It's hard to fully understand
and impossible to relate
to the psychological impact
that this program would have
on the people that it affected,
but also the generations who came
from the people who it affected.
Imagine such a pervasive
force that was sowing division
mistrust, betrayal, and fear,
not just of the government,
but of each other.
Puerto Rico never got
independence, and to this day,
they remain an unincorporated territory,
which means that they
don't have the same rights
as other American citizens.
And the status of the
island is a heated debate.
Many Puerto Ricans value
the modern day benefits
of being connected to
the US, but at what cost.
(dramatic music)
This is backlit by the US'
lasting control over the island.
And even though the people
of Puerto Rico served in our armed forces,
they still can't vote for the president.
They still don't have full
representation in our democracy.
And yet Puerto Rico still
has this immense impact
on American culture and life.
The food, the music, the dance,
the art from this island,
it's a part of what it
means to be American.
And yet, I think most
of us don't really think
about the status of this place
very often or its history.
It's only when there's like
a hurricane on this island
and we see the US kind of barely show
up relative to how they show
up for their other citizens.
Only then are we reminded
that Puerto Rico is a colonial possession,
one taken in war
and exploited through
predatory and racist policies
and then held onto
through a massive amount
of state force spying,
violence and repression.
And what we're left with
is yet another example
of a place whose vibrant
spirit and culture
and people are somehow able
to shine through the dark fog
of colonial abuse that has left
deep wounds on this island.
(soft music)
