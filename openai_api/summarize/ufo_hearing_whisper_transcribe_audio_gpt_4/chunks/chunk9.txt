I also want to note for our witnesses and for the public that I'm a freshman member of Congress, and I've only been here for seven months, but this is by far the most bipartisan conversation and discussion that I have seen happen in the Congress, and I think that a topic of this significance as it relates to our national security, as it relates to information that we're trying to gather for the American public, does bring people together, and I think that's been really great to see. I think it's also important to note for the public, today in our hearing we had on our side also both our full ranking member, which is Mr. Raskin, and our vice ranking member, which is Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, both here at our hearing. I think it shows the importance and seriousness that our side of the aisle is taking to this important hearing, but also the broader issue as it relates to working with our Republican counterparts on this committee. I want to additionally add that I think, and I encourage, I think it's really important that we have and continue these discussions and these hearings. Clearly, there's a lot of information that we don't know, but it's also very clear that we have to continue our investigation and accountability on asking the right questions and ensuring that they're part of the public record. One thing that was important today is some folks might wonder, you know, why are we asking questions that might already be out there or that have been asked before? It's important that they're asked and put into the public record as it relates to this committee. And so I want to thank you for, you know, answering some questions multiple times, I know, not just in maybe meetings you had with some members, but also here in the public. Let me also just add an additional note that it's important also that our friends in the media and those that are not just reporting on this hearing, but that have reported on this topic and that may in the future, the media has an important role in this process. And it's very important that the media engages, does independent investigation and reports on not just what happened today, but what they see independently as what is happening around UAPs in the broader community. That is also an important public benefit that we have in trying to get the information and the facts as it relates to this. Let me also just say finally that as a teacher and an educator and a longtime teacher and researcher that I also really believe in following facts, in doing your homework, and making sure that you follow science as we try to get as much information as possible. And so I want to thank you all for agreeing to do that today. Transparency is a cornerstone of government. We live in a vast galaxy, a lot of unanswered questions. And thank you all for being here today. Mr. Chairman. Thank you. I'd like to one more time thank Mr. Burchett and Ms. Luna for bringing this to our attention. It's a topic that has interested me since I was in school. It was a very illuminating hearing. Obviously, I think several of us are going to look forward to getting some answers in a more confidential setting. I assume some legislation will come out of this. Sure. I apologize, Mr. Chairman. I need to compliment the folks in my office that did a lot of the work on this. Rachel and Noah sitting behind me here, they're very quiet and humble. But without them, this thing would not have come off like it did. So I apologize. Thank you. I think we're going to want to look into what we can do. to make more of this information public. I think there's certainly a time period after which it should always be made public and people have been concerned about these issues, like I said, since I was in high school. But in any event, I'd like to thank everybody who was here sticking through the entire hearing. Without objection, the members will have five legislative days to submit materials and to submit additional written questions for the witnesses, which we forward to the witnesses for their response. If there's no further business, without objection, the subcommittee stands adjourned. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
