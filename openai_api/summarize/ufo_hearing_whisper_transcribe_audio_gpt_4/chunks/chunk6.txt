Not that I'm aware of. They do not. Okay. Now, when it comes to notification that you had mentioned about, um, IRAP pro- IRAD programs, we have seen, uh, defense contractors abuse, uh, their contracts before through this committee. Um, I have seen it personally, um, and I have also seen the notification requirements to Congress abused. Um, I am wondering, one of the loopholes that we see in the law is that there is, at least from my vantage point, is that depending on what we're seeing is that there are no actual definitions or requirements for notification. Are there, what methods of notification did you observe? Like, when they say they notified Congress, how did they do that? Do you have insight into that? Uh, for certain IRAD activities, uh, that would be, uh, I can only think of ones conventional in nature. Um, sometimes they throw, uh, flow through certain, how to say, SAP programs that have cognizant authority over the Air Force or something. And those are congressionally reported compartments, but IRAD is literally internal to the contractors. So as long as it's money, either profits, private investment, et cetera, they can do whatever they want. To put a finer point on it, when there is a requirement for any agency or company to notify or any agency to notify Congress, do they contact the chairman of a committee? Do they get them on the phone specifically? Is this through an email to, hypothetically, a dead email box? A lot of it comes through what they call the PPR, periodic program review process. If it's a, you know, a SAP or controlled access program equity, and then those go to the specific committees, whether it be the SAS, CASC, HSE. Thank you. Um, I apologize. I just, my time is limited. Um, Mr. Graves, one of your main concerns that the FAA currently does not have an official process to receive reports of UAP from pilots or others, correct? Correct. And, um, in your experience, what data should the AERO program prioritize for potential collection? We have, you know, location, date, time, but are there other specific characteristics that should be included in these reports? Certainly. Uh, I think that there's two categories that would be important. Uh, one would be kinematics and understanding the specifics of how the vehicle or objects are moving. Uh, and the second would be a more zoomed out approach of being able to, uh, look at origin and destination, uh, after, before the incident, as well as getting a better contextual understanding of how these, uh, these objects are interacting with each other. Thank you. Now, because I only have a minute left, I apologize. We only have five minutes today, but, um, for the record, if you were me, where would you look? Titles, programs, departments, regions, if you could just name anything. Um, and I put that as an open question to the three of you. I'd be happy to give you that in a closed environment. I can tell you specifically. Thank you. Um, Commander Fravor? I would say, and I've told people that you have to know where to look. They're not going to divulge it to you because of the classification levels. But if you know where to look and who to talk to, which is exactly where Mr. Grush can point you, then you, then you have them. Okay. Mr. Graves? I was an operator, so I was defending on folks like Mr. Grush to do that homework. Okay. Thank you very much. I yield back to the chair. Mr. Biggs? Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I thank the witnesses for being here today. I'm over here. Thank you so much for being here. Um, I, I want to get into, uh, specifics here. And, and, uh, the reason I'm going to go this way is because you've talked a bit about, um, what I would call misdirection by, um, official U.S. government with regard to UAPs, right? And so I'm gonna get to that in a second. But last week, White House NSC spokesman John Kirby stated that UAPs are having an impact on our training ranges and need to be treated as a legitimate issue. Do you concur with the statements? That's for each of you. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Now, having said that, I'm gonna take you to specific instances around the Phoenix Valley, because that's where I live. In 97, we had the famous Phoenix light case. I don't know if any of you are familiar with that. There were two things that went along with that. And the explanation was military training range off Luke and the Barry Goldwater range. Do you know anything different other than the official explanation of those lights? Only what's in the public vernacular about it. That was outside the scope of my duties. And if we wanted to, just my question along with my colleague from New York, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, if we wanted to find out more about that, where would we go to find the files? And who would we address? And are you gonna tell me we need to go to the SCIF so you can tell us in a SCIF? I could potentially give you a vector on that. That specific case, I'm not, I mean, I'm familiar with it in terms of public, but I give you a vector in a closed environment, yeah. That would be good, thank you. So if it's true that UAPs are having an impact on training ranges, and this administration considers it to be a legitimate issue, what steps can Congress take to address training range impacts? And I say that having two very large training ranges in my state. And so we'll start with Mr. Graves and go on down the panel. Some of the initial procedures have been implemented, such as within the United States Navy that have a range follow report that gathers information from pilots. I understand that a service-wide reporting mechanism is still pending. However, that would be a great next step, not only for gathering information, but for showing the troops that is an acceptable topic and reducing the stigma. Okay, please, all of you continue. Yeah, as a recipient of a lot of those training range reports, sometimes we only get contextual kind of oral reporting. It'd be nice if they attached all sensor data and there's a system in place that can handle multiple classifications of data. And that's an issue with the F-35, right? That jet was never built to be an ISR platform, and it's a pain in the, what to say, butt to get that data off, so yeah. Great, thank you. Yeah, I would agree with the previous two being a user of those training ranges that the data has to be out there. You have to acknowledge that you're seeing them, and then you have to collect the data. Right now, you get the report. Someone says, I saw something, but no one collects the radar data to back it up and do research. Okay, do you believe that the 2019 classification guidelines for UAPs interferes with the federal government's ability to be transparent with the American people, and do you think we need to be more transparent with the American people? All of you, yeah. I'll say yes to that. Yeah, I'm familiar with the, at least the UAP Task Force 2019 security classification guide. I think it's fair. I did actually help author that with the director. Uh-oh, you got a bias that way then. Yeah, but I will say, I'll call it a lazy attitude about declassifying videos. I've seen some of the videos of the recent shoot down, and I saw no reason that couldn't have been released as long as they mask some data. The American people deserve to see that imagery in full motion video. I would think, well, in my opinion, I will say things are overclassified. I know for a fact the video or the pictures that came out in the 20, I think it was 2020 report that had the stuff off the East Coast, they were taken with an iPhone off the East Coast. A buddy of mine was one of the senior people there, and he said they were originally classified to TSSCI. And my question to him was, what's TSSCI about these? They're an iPhone literally off the vacapes. That's not TSSCI. So they're overclassified, and as soon as they do that, they go in a vault, and then you all have to look for them. Yeah, so with the overclassification, that may be one way. Are there other ways that the DOD or intelligence agencies are keeping this information from the American people or even from Congress? I think part of that has been not encouraging reporting. If the problem is not something that can be measured, it's not something that's gonna be fixed. Okay, very good. Well, I'm out of time, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. First of all, without objection, Representative Nick Langworthy of New York has waived down the subcommittee for purpose of questioning witnesses at today's subcommittee hearing. And then we go to Mr. Burleson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate you guys coming out today, testifying. Look, I've been here for six months, and I'm pretty skeptical. I don't trust anything in this town. And so, and I think that's because I'm from Missouri. You've gotta show me, right? With that being said, there's been a lot of things that have been said in the public, Mr. Grush, and so I wanna get down to, if we can, some specifics, right? So at one point you had said that there has been harmful activity or aggressive activity. Has any of the activity been aggressive, been hostile in your reports? I know of multiple colleagues of mine that got physically injured. And the activity, and I gotta, By UAPs or by people within the federal government? Both. Okay, so there has been activity by alien or non-human technology and or beings that has caused harm to humans. I can't get into the specifics in an open environment, but at least the activity that I personally witnessed, and I have to be very careful here, because you don't, you know, they tell you never to acknowledge tradecraft, right? So what I personally witnessed myself and my wife was very disturbing. Okay, one of my constituents actually sent this next question, and I figured I'd ask it since I had the same thought. You've said that U.S. has intact spacecraft. You said that the government has alien bodies or alien species. Have you seen the spacecraft? I have to be careful to describe what I've seen firsthand and not in this environment, but I could answer that question behind closed doors. Have you seen any of the bodies? That's something I've not witnessed myself. Okay, and so with that being said, you know, the other statement that has been made that was intriguing to me, and it's intriguing because my view has been that we are billions of light years away from any other system. And the concept that an alien species that's technologically advanced enough to travel billions of light years gets here and somehow is incompetent enough to not survive Earth or crashes is something that I find a little bit far-fetched. And with that being said, you have mentioned that there's interdimensional potential. Could you expound on that? I'll get to answer your first question. And, you know, I'm here as a fact witness and expert, but I will give you a theoretical framework, at least to work off, to kind of espouse crashes, regardless of, you know, your level of sentience, right? You know, planes crash, cars crash. N number of sorties, however high, a small percentage are going to end in, you know, mission failure, if you will, as we say in the Air Force. And then in terms of multidimensionality, that kind of thing, the framework that I'm familiar with, for example, is something called the holographic principle. Both it's, it derives itself from general relativity and quantum mechanics, and that is, if you want to imagine a 3D objects such as yourself casting a shadow onto a 2D surface, that's the holographic principle. So you can be projected, quasi-projected from higher dimensional space to lower dimensional. It's a scientific trope that you can actually cross, literally, as far as I understand, but there's probably guys with PhDs that we could probably argue about that. But you have not seen any documentation that that's what's occurring? Only a theoretical framework discussion, yes. OK. OK. Occam's razor is that these aircraft, have they been identified that they are being produced by domestic military contractors? Is there any evidence that that's what's being recovered? Not to my knowledge, plus the recoveries predate a lot of our advanced programs that I previously am witting of, so. Would it be safe to say that there could be a scenario today where you have an aircraft that crashes because it's been involved in one program from one federal agency, but the agency that retrieves it is not aware of that program, and to them, it appears alien in origin? I mean, that's a hypothetical situation. I'm not aware of any historical situation that would match that that you described, so. It has not happened that you're aware of. That I'm aware of. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Several months ago, my office received a protected disclosure from Eglin Air Force Base indicating that there was a UAP incident that required my attention. I sought a briefing regarding that episode and brought with me Congressman Burchett and Congresswoman Luna. We asked to see any of the evidence that had been taken by flight crew in this endeavor and to observe any radar signature as well as to meet with the flight crew. We were not afforded access to all of the flight crew, and initially, we were not afforded access to images and to radar. Thereafter, we had a bit of a discussion about how authorities flow in the United States of America, and we did see the image, and we did meet with one member of the flight crew who took the image. The image was of something that I am not able to attach to any human capability, either from the United States or from any of our adversaries. And I'm somewhat informed on the matter, having served on the Armed Services Committee for seven years, having served on the committee that oversees DARPA and advanced technologies for several years.
