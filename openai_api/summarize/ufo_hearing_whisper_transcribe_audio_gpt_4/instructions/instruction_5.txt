Lieutenant Ryan Graves, who is a former Navy F-18 pilot and executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, believes that there is a lack of transparency and declassification of information regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). He argues that UAP sightings are frequently witnessed by military and commercial pilots but often go unreported due to fear of professional consequences. Graves emphasizes the need for a centralized reporting system and better communication to properly document and address UAP sightings. He shares his own experience encountering a UAP and highlights the lack of official acknowledgment and the need to address safety and security concerns. Graves and others also discuss ongoing safety risks and the need for transparency and clarity in reporting on UAP phenomena. They express concerns about corporate interests prioritizing reputation over public safety and suggest potential misappropriation of funds and government involvement in a disinformation campaign.

Please provide a detailed summary of the following: 
Garouche, in your sworn testimony, you state that the United States government has retrieved supposedly extraterrestrial spacecraft and other UAP-related artifacts. You go so far as to state that the U.S. is in possession of, quote, non-human spacecraft, end quote, and that some of these artifacts have circulated with defense contractors. Several other former military and intelligence officials have come forward with similar allegations, albeit in non-public settings. However, Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, the director of AARO, previously testified before Congress that there has been, and I quote, no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity or of, quote, off-world technology brought to the attention of the office. To your knowledge, is that statement correct? It's not accurate. I believe Dr. Kirkpatrick mentioned he had about 30 individuals that have come to AARO thus far. A few of those individuals have also come to AARO that I also interviewed, and I know what they provided Dr. Kirkpatrick and their team. I was able to evaluate that information. Okay. I need to go on. Sure. But my understanding, his statement is accurate, came from a direct quote, and this contradiction is a perfect example of why we need to inject transparency into our government. And for another example, look no further than the pitiful response to the Chinese spy balloon debacle earlier this year. You may remember the mass confusion that ensued when the balloon was first spotted over Montana, four days after it first entered U.S. airspace over Alaska. The Biden administration's initial inability to address the object grew into a continuous series of embarrassments. After news of the balloon reached the mainstream media, we were assured that the balloon posed no threat to our security. However, after the balloon was allowed to transit the entire continental United States, fighter jets were scrambled off the coast of South Carolina to shoot it down. This flip-flopping and obfuscation caused needless confusion, fear, and panic across the country. It's my hope, Mr. Chairman, that this sort of confusion will not be repeated. We should investigate the extent to which elements of our government possess or do not possess information that is of critical value to the American people. We owe it to the citizens of this nation to make sure that our government is transparent and accountable. We must make sure that our government provides answers, and Congress must do its duty to solicit those answers. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Yeah, Mr. Frost. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In 2022, NASA announced that it was commissioning an independent study team to examine UAPs. The NASA team is comprised of scientists across different fields, as well as former astronauts and pilots. In May, the independent study team held its first public meeting, which included the perspectives from NASA senior leaders, as well as perspectives from the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. The NASA study team is also expected to release its first report pretty soon, and I think it's safe to say that we all eagerly await its results. Mr. Graves, how might NASA's research influence the commercial industry regarding safety and UAP? I think NASA has a big role to play as far as commercial aviation safety, and it's one of their original charges. organization. One of the recommendations that have been put forward is to utilize their existing aviation safety reporting system to serve as a short-term fill and trusted platform for pilots that want to report on UAP. It also has built-in analytics capability and is funded by Congress. Gotcha. And also, Mr. Graves, are there any other industries that may be influenced by the NASA research on UAPs? And if so, how so? Well, I think there is a large swath of commercial capabilities that could be brought to bear on this topic from space-based or ground-based sensor systems that are available open source or through commercial marketplaces. And I think NASA's work, as they work to identify and highlight specific parameters that can be found, we can take that information and promulgate this through the public sector so that we can have more open conversation about what we're seeing. You know, in 2020, the Department of Defense released several videos of UAPs, including Mr. Frayer's experience, U.S. Navy pilots that recorded footage. In 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a preliminary report on UAP events. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson stated that NASA would begin to investigate these events. In fact, I sit on Science, Space and Technology Committee, and when we were doing a hearing with the NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, I asked, you know, why NASA needed to be fully funded. And there were many great reasons, but one of them was actually had to do with UAPs. He actually mentioned, you know, is there life out there? I don't know. And so either way, these actions ultimately led NASA to assemble the independent study team that I mentioned earlier. Also in 2021, Harvard University stood up the Galileo Project to research and examine the origins of UAP. So it seems like both, you know, from NASA and in the higher education community, because of the work that y'all have done and people standing up, you know, I think we're seeing some of that stigma slowly going away. Mr. Frayer, do you believe that military pilots feeling empowered to share their UAP experiences has directly impacted the scientific community's research goals on this topic? I would say yes. I would say that, you know, starting in 2017, when it actually came out, it took that stigma away. I mean, I've talked to multiple senators who said prior to that, if you'd have mentioned UAP, you'd have been laughed off the hill. And now you were sitting here today for a public testimony on what's actually going on. You know, I'm hoping that this curve will be more of an exponential, and we'll get more and more transparent to the level that we can. Yeah, yeah. And yeah, I mean, it's important. I couldn't imagine, you know, I'm not a pilot, but I used to fly gliders in Civil Air Patrol. Yeah, I got it. Yeah. And so either way, I mean, I couldn't imagine, you know, being being in the glider and seeing something, and then not feeling like I had the agency to talk about it. Mr. Graves, can you discuss the importance of seeking scientists to sit on your advisory board? Absolutely. I think ultimately, this is going to be a scientific problem. And not only that, it's also an engineering problem. I've been working with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics to help them stand up a UAP integration committee to help integrate their engineering prowess into this problem. And so yes, very much, I think this is an engineering and scientific problem as much as a national security problem. And how might Congress help to facilitate partnerships between the scientific community and the UAP focus groups within government? Well, I think one of the things they can do is to have these types of hearings to communicate to the public that this is a topic of interest. I think that there is a pseudo market, if you will, of interested capabilities and talent that want to approach this topic. And we're seeing that start to grow now. So I think continued conversation, reduction of stigma is going to allow that to flourish and allow answers to help generate themselves. 100%. Well, thank you all for being here. Thank you for your work. I think it's important that we keep our top scientific minds focused on this issue and look for ways to increase collaboration. Thank you so much. I yield back. Mr. Comer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me say I want to thank you for having this hearing. I want to thank Mr. Burchett, Ms. Luna for leading this hearing. And with that, I yield by five minutes to Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to direct this, I believe, to Mr. Grush. But if any of you all feel like you need to jump in, just jump right in. We're good. Has the U.S. government become aware of actual evidence of extraterrestrial, otherwise unexplained forms of intelligence? And if so, when do you think this first occurred? I like to use the term non-human. I don't like to denote origin. Keeps the aperture open, both scientifically. Certainly, like I've discussed publicly previously, 1930s. Okay. Can you give me the names and titles of the people with direct firsthand knowledge and access to some of this crash retrieval, some of these crash retrieval programs, and maybe which facilities, military bases that would, the recovered material would be in? And I know a lot of Congress talked about, we're going to go to Area 51 and, you know, and there's nothing there anymore anyway. It's just, you know, and we move like a glacier. As soon as we announce it, I'm sure the moving vans would pull up, but please. I can't discuss that publicly, but I did provide that information both to the intel committees and the inspector general. And we could get that in the SCIF if we were allowed to get in a SCIF with you. Would that be probably what you would think? Sure. If you had the appropriate accesses. Yeah. What special access programs cover this information and how is it possible that they have evaded oversight for so long? I do know the names. Once again, I can't discuss that publicly and how they've evaded oversight. I, in a closed setting, I can tell you the specific tradecraft use. All right. When did, when do you think those programs began and who authorized them? I do know a lot of that information, but that's something I can't discuss publicly. All right. If any of y'all want to jump in on any of this, you're more than welcome to. Um, what level of security clearance is required to fully access these programs? Well, anybody who has, and I say that because myself, um, Representative Gates and Representative Luna were basically turned away at one point at Eglin. So please go right ahead. Certainly a difference between member access and say somebody like me, but anybody who has a, you know, TSSCI clearance and meets the eligibility criteria, the access adjudicative authority should be able to grant you access. Mr. Burchard, if you'll yield. So just to be, put a fine point on that. There's nothing that you're aware of that's above special access program classification. It's a misnomer that there's anything actually above top secret executive order 13, 526 delineates classification levels. Right. And, but I, I draw a point on that because we can have access to, to those programs. And so the notion that we're not being given that access sort of defies our typical muscle memory here in Congress. Thank you, Mr. Burchard. I'll yield back to you. Thank you, Mr. Gates. Um, along those lines, Title 10, you might not know this or not, but a Title 10 and Title 50 authorization, as they, they seem to say they're inefficient. So who gets to decide this in your opinion in the past? Uh, it's a group of career, uh, senior executive officials. Okay. Are they government officials? Both in and out. Do what? Both in and out of government. And that's about as far as I can go there. All right. Well, that's, it leads to my next question, which private corporations are directly involved in this program? How much taxpayer money has been invested in these programs to your knowledge? I mean, we know, we know we, we audit the Pentagon every year and I've been here five years and they failed the dadgum thing every year. They, uh, lose over a billion dollars a year, we think. And I've told the Department of Defense, maybe 60% of their assets are unaccounted for, whatever the heck that means. In the public sector, you go to jail for that kind of crap. So tell me. Yeah, I know when I, um, I'm a dollar off of my DTS travel voucher, I get hammered, but, uh, it seems like it doesn't work the other way. If you sell over six, if you sell over $600 worth of stuff on eBay, now you get a call from the IRS. So please, what corporations? Yeah, I don't know the specific metrics towards the end of your question. The specific corporations I did provide to the committees in specific divisions. And I spent 11 and a half hours with both Intel committees. Okay. Has there been any, has there been an active U.S. government disinformation campaign to deny the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena? And if so, why? I can't go beyond what I've already espoused publicly about that. Okay. I've been told to ask you what that, what that is and how to get it in the record, which, uh, what have you stated publicly in your interviews for the congressional record? Uh, yeah. If you, uh, reference my News Nation interview and I talk about a multi-decade, you know, campaign to, um, disenfranchise public interest, basically. Apologize, Mr. Chairman. I yield back negative 21 seconds. Thank you. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to our witnesses for coming here today. Um, I do concur with the ranking members as well as several other members here on this committee that this is a committee for whistleblowers and for the protection of whistleblowers as well. So we understand what you're putting, um, on the table here and we're putting on the line here and we thank you for that. Uh, Mr. Grush, you sat on the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon Task Force created in the 2020 NDAA, correct? Yes. There have been some things that, uh, that have been mentioned here during this hearing that I wanted to pick up on. Um, Mr. Graves, you mentioned specifically during the answers to one of your questions, you named Boeing contractors, um, being engaged in an incident regarding this red cube about a football, um, a football field wide. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the interaction, or Mr. Grush, either of you, the interactions between defense contractor companies and any UAP-related programs or activities. So I'll just say that the information about, um, the contractor himself were provided by a witness and I have no particular detail in that relationship. Mr. Grush. Uh, the kind of general unclass wavetops, certainly the contractors, you know, are the metal benders, so to speak. They're the ones actually, uh, doing specific performance on government contracts. Are they required, um, to issue any disclosure regarding UAP sightings or do they engage in any reporting around this? Uh, in terms of the contractors? Yes.
