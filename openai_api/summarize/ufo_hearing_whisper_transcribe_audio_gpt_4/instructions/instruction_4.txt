Lieutenant Ryan Graves, a former Navy F-18 pilot and executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, discusses the prevalence of UAP sightings among military and commercial pilots and the barriers preventing their reporting. He advocates for transparency and the declassification of UAP information to promote understanding and dispel speculation. Additionally, Graves shares his personal encounter with a UAP and highlights the lack of acknowledgement and the safety and security concerns associated with these phenomena.

Please provide a detailed summary of the following: 
Can you describe your experience after you decided to come forward and go public with your experience? Certainly. Like many others, in 2017, I saw the New York Times article come out as well, and for me, it was special because I recognized the voices on the video. I recognized the video itself. I had seen it when it was taken. I'd seen it when it was debriefed, and so that kind of shook me because I realized that this problem was still ongoing, and so I reached out to colleagues back on the East Coast and realized that this was still a safety risk that they were dealing with, that they had essentially hit a wall with how they could move forward on this conversation. It was at that point when I decided to try to move the conversation forward myself. Are there common characteristics to the UAPs that have been cited by different pilots, and can you describe what the convergence of descriptions is? Certainly. We were primarily seeing dark gray or black cubes inside of a clear sphere. I'm sorry, dark gray or black cubes? Yes, inside of a clear sphere where the apex or tips of the cube were touching the inside of that sphere, and that was primarily what was being reported when we were able to gain a visual tally of these objects, and that occurred over almost eight years, and as far as I know, it's still occurring. So I take it that you're arguing what we need is real transparency in a reporting system so we can get some clarity on what's going on out there because there are many pilots in your situation, but we should have a way of developing a systematic inventory of all of such encounters. Is that right? Yes, and I think we need both transparency and the reporting. We have the reporting, but we need to make sure that information can be promulgated to commercial aviation as well as the rest of the populace. Mr. Grush, what about you? What was your experience after you came forward? Well, it's only been about two months or so, so I guess my experience has been overwhelming support from former colleagues of mine that have privately messaged me, and I do appreciate that, but I do have knowledge of active planned reprisal activity. against myself and other colleagues, and it's very upsetting to me. Coming from where? Certain senior leadership at previous agencies I was associated with, and that's all I'll say publicly, but I can provide more details in a closed environment. Okay, well, I hope you understand that there would be bipartisan rejection of any attempt to vilify, demonize, or engage in other reprisals against our witnesses and people who are telling the truth from their perspective. Yeah, there were certain colleagues of mine that were brutally administratively attacked, and it actually makes me very upset as a leader to see that happen to other coworkers and actually superiors of mine over the last three years. How do you account for that response? That seems like a bizarre response. I call it administrative terrorism. That's their quiver, their tool in the toolbox to silence people, especially the career government service cares about their career, cares about their clearance, their reputation, to climb the ladder, and when you threaten that career path, a lot of people back off, but I'm here to represent those people. Mr. Fravor, what about you? What has your experience been since you've come forward with your perspective on this? Actually, I've been treated very well, and the six people that were involved, myself included, all of them have or will be retiring from the military as O5s or O6s, and all my friends that are very senior, three and four stars, I've talked to them. They believe, they understand there's a problem, but no, I was actually treated really well. And what is your general interpretation of these phenomena, or what is your current thinking of trying to make sense of them? Well, I'll say, you know, I'm not like a UFO fanatic, it's not me, but I will tell you that what we saw with four sets of eyes over a five-minute period, still, there's nothing, we have nothing close to it. It was amazing to see, I told my buddy I wanted to fly it, but yeah, it's just an incredible technology. All right, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, I'll yield back to you. Thanks, on to Ms. Luna. Mr. Grush, in speaking to you yesterday, I just wanted to follow up on Representative Raskin's questions. In the last couple of years, have you had incidences that have caused you to be in fear for your life for addressing these issues? Yes, personally. I just want everyone to note that he's coming forward in fear of his life to put in perspective if they were really not scared about this information coming out, why would someone be intimidated like that? To your knowledge, are NHIs working with adversarial foreign governments in either technology exchange programs or back engineering programs? I don't have data on that, I'm not sure. Have you heard or you had people come forward to present that evidence? Not that particular evidence that you just espoused. Okay, on the 19th of April, Dr. Kirkpatrick, head of Aero, had said that he did not find any evidence of UAPs. You also stated that you had, in your interview, that you had briefed him on information that you were uncovering, but that he did not follow up with you. Were the items that you divulged to him pertinent to national security? Yes, him and I had a classified conversation in April 2022 before he took over Aero in July 2022, and I provided him some concerns I had. Do you know why he might not have followed up with you? Unfortunately, I cannot read his mind. I wish he did. I was happy to give sage counsel to him on where to look when he took the helm of Aero. Okay, and then my last question for you before I move to Mr. Graves is, you received prior approval from the Defense Department to speak on certain issues, correct? Correct, through DOPSER, DoD Pre-Publication and Security Review, and I just want to remind the public, they're just looking from a security perspective. These are my own personal views and opinions, not the Department's. Okay, I'm asking that though mainly because I think that there are many people that would like to discredit you, so it does bring a certain amount of credibility to your testimony. I'm required by law to do that as a former intelligence officer or I go to jail for revealing classified information. Yeah, we don't want you to go to jail. My next question would actually be for Mr. Graves. Can you please explain to me in detail the event that occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base? Certainly. In the 2003 timeframe, a large group of Boeing contractors were operating near one of the launch facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base when they observed a very large 100-yard sighted red square approach the base from the ocean and hover at low altitude over one of the launch facilities. This object remained for about 45 seconds or so before darting off over the mountains. There was a similar event within 24 hours later in the evening. This was a morning event, I believe 8.45 in the morning. Later in the evening post sunset, there were reports of other sightings on base, including some aggressive behaviors. These objects were approaching some of the security guards at rapid speeds before darting off and this is information that was received through one of the witnesses that have approached me at Americans for Safe Aerospace. Was this documented in any official form, whether it was a police blotter? Yes. They had official documentation and records from the event that the witness held over the years. And I'm not going to ask you to do it right now for time reasons, but you'd be able to sketch what was witnessed, correct? And have you seen that before on any other equipment and or during your flight time? I have not seen what they've described. This object was estimated to be almost the size of a football field and I have not seen anything personally that large. Okay, and then another question on follow-up, referencing the gimbal video, go fast incident. Can you just clarify, because to our understanding the footage was actually cut off at a certain point, but what happens at the end of that video just for those Americans specifically there that are wanting to know about the rest of that footage? Certainly. There was some uncertainty or instability with the object. It seemed to rock a bit and that's the last I had seen of the video. Much of the data that I would recommend be analyzed would consist of radar data that would provide precise kinematics on the object as well as the fleet of objects that were operating nearby. Okay, and follow-up, in regards to the reporting procedures that Mr. Garcia had addressed on as well as Representative Burchett, with the FAA, to your understanding, pilots that are seeing this, commercial airline pilots, are they receiving cease and desist letters from corporations for coming forward with information in regards to safety for potential airline passengers? I have been made privy to a conversation with commercial aviators who have received cease and desist orders. So the American public should know that corporations are putting their own reputations on the, not the line, but ahead of the safety of the American people, and I think, would you agree with that statement? It appears so. Okay. I guess this would be my last, I'm out of time, I yield. I'll be back. Good. Mr. Moskowitz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, let's talk about the laws of physics for a second. Mr. Graves, and Commander Faber, I heard you talk about speed. When those objects broke the sound barrier, did they make a sonic boom? I was in a jet, you can't hear anything, it's kind of loud in there. Yeah, you're not able to actually personally tell within the vehicle. I will say the objects that we were seeing, they were spherical, and they were observed up to Mach 2, which is a very non-aerodynamic shape. What about G-forces? Let's talk about G-forces of those vehicles. Could a human survive those G-forces with known technology today? No. No, not for the acceleration rates that we observed. Okay. What about what they look like? How close did you get? Did you see a seam, or a rivet, or a section? And what I mean is, obviously, the jets you're flying have all those things. Did these objects have those? I didn't have the detail to be able to tell that. So we got within a half mile of the tic-tac, which people say that's pretty far, but in airplanes that's actually relatively close. No, it was perfectly white, smooth, no windows, although when we did take the original FLIR video that is out there, when you put it on a big screen, it actually had two little objects that came out of the bottom of it. But other than that, no windows, no seams, no nothing. Mr. Grush, as a result of your previous government work, have you met with people with direct knowledge, or have direct knowledge yourself, of non-human origin craft? Yes, I personally interviewed those individuals. Mr. Grush, as a result of your previous government work, have you met with people with direct knowledge, or have direct knowledge yourself, about ATs, advanced technologies that the U.S. government has? Based on conventional advanced tech, I was briefed to the preponderance of the defense departments, both space and aerospace compartmental programs, yeah. Do you have knowledge, or do you have reason to believe that there are programs in the advanced tech space that are unsanctioned? Yes, I do. Okay. And when you say that they're above congressional oversight, what do you mean? Complicated question, so there's some, I would call it abuse here, so congressional oversight of conventional special access programs, and I'll use Title 10, so DOD as an example, right, so 10 U.S. Code Section 119 discusses congressional oversight of SAPs, discusses the DEPSEC DEF's ability to waive congressional reporting, however, the Gang of Eight is at least supposed to be notified if a waived or waived bigoted unacknowledged SAP is created, and that's public law. Well, so then how does, I mean, I don't want to cut you off, but how does a program like that get funded? I will give you generalities, I can get very specific in a closed session, but a misappropriation of funds and self-fund. Does that mean that there is money in the budget that is said to go to a program, but it doesn't, and it goes to something else? Yes, I have specific knowledge of that, yep. Do you think U.S. corporations are overcharging for certain tech they're selling to the U.S. government, and that additional money is going to programs? Correct, through something called IRAD. Okay. Satellite imagery. Let's talk about satellite imagery. We have satellites all over the place, some that we're aware of, and many that we're not aware of, right? We're taking pictures of everything at every point and second. Mr. Grush, are you aware, do you have direct knowledge, have you talked to people with direct knowledge that there are satellite imagery of these events? That was one of my primary tasks at NGA, since we process, exploit, and disseminate that kind of information. I've seen multiple cases, some of which, to my understanding, and of course I left NGA in April, so that's my information cutoff date. But I personally reviewed both what we call overhead collection and from other strategic and tactical platforms that were, I could not even explain prosaically, and I have a degree in physics, by the way, as well. And I am aware that you guys have not seen these reports, unfortunately, and I don't know why. Do you have direct knowledge, or have you spoken to people with direct knowledge that this imagery applies to crash sites, crash imagery? I can't discuss that in an open session. Do you have any information that the U.S. government is involved in a disinformation campaign to deny the existence of certain UAPs? I can't go beyond what I've already stated publicly in my NewsNation interview, because it touches other sensitivities. I'll yield the balance of my time back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Fox? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank our witnesses for being here today. Mr.
