Please provide a detailed summary of the following: 
I serve on the National Security Subcommittee for the Financial Services Committee. So I really want to stay in the national security lane, if I may. So when we think about traditional adversaries and both us towards them and them towards us, you know, we probe their capabilities. We look for weaknesses and we collect that data, that reconnaissance for in the event we need it in the future. For each of you, yes or no question. Based off of your own experience or the data that you've been privy to, is there any indication that these UAPs could be essentially collecting reconnaissance information? Mr. Graves. Yes. Mr. Grush. Fair assessment. Mr. Fravor. Very possible. Again, in the national security vein, is it possible that these UAPs would be probing our capabilities? Yes or no. Mr. Graves. Yes. Grush. Yes. Fravor. Definitely. Is it possible that these UAPs are testing for vulnerabilities in our current systems? Yes. Yes. Possible. Do you feel, based off of your experience and information that you've been privy to, that these UAPs provide an existential threat to the national security of the United States? Mr. Graves. Potentially. Yes, sir. Potentially. Same answer. Potentially. I'd say definitely. Potentially. Mr. Graves and Fravor, you know, in the event that your encounters have become hostile, would you have had the capability to defend yourself, your crew, your aircraft? Absolutely not, sir. No. Is, based off of the information that you've been privy to, is there any indication that these UAPs are interested in our nuclear technology and capabilities? Yes. By external observation, sure, that could be a fair assessment, yeah. Yes. Is there any indication that the Department of Energy is involved in UAP data collection and housing? I don't have an answer. I can't confirm or deny that in a public setting. Could you do it in a secure setting? Yes. Mr. Fravor. No, I don't know. Mr. Chairman, you know, I think I'm the last member to go, but there clearly is a threat to the national security of the United States of America. As members of Congress, we have a responsibility to maintain oversight and be aware of these activities so that, if appropriate, we take action. I would encourage the Chairman to demand that we have any and all, but in particular Mr. Grush, talk to us in a SCIF, and if that access is denied, I will personally volunteer to initiate the Holman Rule against any personnel or any program or any agency that denies access to Congress. Mr. Chairman, with that, I will yield the remainder of my time to my fellow colleague from Tennessee, Mr. Burchard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Ogles, for the great questions, brother. Mr. Grush, I might have asked this before, but I want to make sure, do you have any personal knowledge of someone who's possibly been injured working on legacy UAP reverse engineering? Yes. Okay. How were they injured? Was it, is it something like a radioactive type situation or something we didn't understand? I've heard people talk about Havana Syndrome type incidences. What was your recollection of that? I can't get into specifics, but you can imagine assessing an unknown unknown. There's a lot of potentialities you can't fully prepare for. How do you think we ought to handle UAP whistleblower complaints like yours in the future? Yeah, there was some issue with mine. So, you know, PPD-19 process, it goes to the intel committees, either through PPD-19 or ICD-120. There's not a good way for the intelligence community inspector general to provide that to other committees. And I asked... my information to be sent to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee because there are Title 10 equities at play, but there was no smooth process to do so. Yeah. That's a trash can. Are you aware of any individuals that are participating in reverse engineering programs for non-terrestrial craft? Personally yes. Mm-hmm. Do you know any that would be willing to testify if there were protections for them? Certainly closed door and assurances, breaking their NDA, they're not going to get administratively punished for so. Yeah. I yield. Mr. Chairman. Thank you. We're going to do something a little bit out of the ordinary here. We're going to give three people a chance at an additional three minutes. So Mr. Burchett, do you want to keep going? Why don't you come back to me, Mr. Chairman? I'd like to submit for the record an article by News Nation, and it follows Mr. Grush's full interview for the record. Without objection. Thank you. Mr. Grush, why is it that you refer to the phenomenon as non-human intelligence? Why deviate from the basis of extraterrestrial life? I think the phenomenon is very complex, and I like to leave an open mind analytically to specific origin. When you say specific origin, are you referring, can you elaborate on that for those that might want to know? If it's a traditional extraterrestrial origin or something else that we don't quite understand from either a biological or astrophysics perspective, yeah, I just like to keep an open mind on what it could be. Yeah. Referring to your News Nation interview, you had referenced specific treaties between governments. Article 3 of the Nuclear Arms Treaty with Russia identifies UAPs. It specifically mentions them. To your knowledge, are there safety measures in place with foreign governments or other superpowers to avoid an escalatory situation in the event that a UAP malevolent event occurs? Yeah, you're referring to actual public treaty in the UN register. It's funny you mention that. Yeah, the Agreement on Measures to Reduce the Risk of Outbreak of Nuclear War signed in 1971, unclassified treaty publicly available. And if you cite the George Washington University National Security Archives, you will find the declassified in 2013 specific provisions in the specific red line flashed message traffic with the specific codes pursuant to Article 3 and Article, also Situation 2, which is in the previously classified NSA archive. What I would recommend, and I tried to get access, but I got a wall of silence at the White House, was those specific incidents when those message traffic was used. I think some scholarship on that would open the door to a further investigation using those publicly available information. Thank you. And then my last question with 51 seconds remaining. You mentioned white-collar crimes potentially being, taking place in regards to a cover-up. Can you please elaborate? I have concerns based on the interviews I conducted under my official duties of potential violations of the federal acquisition regulations, the FAR. Thank you very much. Chairman, I yield the remainder of my time. Okay, we'll go to Mr. Raskin for three minutes. Thanks, Mr. Chair. I thank the witnesses for their endurance and service today. Mr. Fravor, you've described your episode in detail now, and you call it the most credible UFO sighting in history. I wonder, was this the first time that you encountered a UFO or a UAP in 2004? Yes. And what was your general attitude or perspective on the UFO discussion before that happened? I never felt that we were alone with all the planets out there, but I wasn't a UFO person. I wasn't watching History Channel and MUFON and all that. And have you had experiences or encounters since that happened? No. And so, have you formed any general conclusions about what you think you experienced then? Yes. I think what we experienced was, like I said, well beyond the material science and the capabilities that we had at the time, that we have currently, or that we're going to have in the next ten to twenty years. Very good. Mr. Grush, you've been able to answer in great detail on certain questions, and then other things you say you're not able to respond to. Can you just explain where you're drawing the line and what's the basis for that? Yeah, based on my DOPSER security review and what they've determined that is unclassified. I see. So you're answering any questions that just call upon your knowledge of unclassified questions, but anything that relates to classified matters you're not commenting on in this context? In an open session, but happy to participate in a closed session at the right level, yeah. Okay. And Mr. Graves, you said that there are dozens of fellow pilots, military pilots. Are there also commercial pilots who've encountered the same kind of sightings that you described before? They are similar. Commercial pilots have less range and less sensors to be able to reach out and look for objects over a wide swath of airspace. And so pilots are seeing them, commercial pilots are seeing them, and they're typically closer and the range of what they're seeing is pretty large. What is the most vivid concrete sighting with the naked eye of the objects that you described before, the cube-like objects? Certainly. I think the most vivid sighting of that would have been near midair that we had at the entrance to our working area. One of these objects was completely stationary at the exact entrance to our working areas, not only geographically, but also at altitude. So it was right where all the jets are going, essentially, on the eastern seaboard. The two aircraft flew within about 50 feet of the object, and that was a very close visual sighting. And you were in one of the aircraft? I was not. I was there when the pilot landed. He canceled the mission after, and I was there. He was in the ready room with all his gear on, with his mouth open, and I asked him what the problem was, and he said he almost hit one of those darn things. He said he was 50 feet away from it? Yes, sir. His description of the object was consistent with the description you gave us before? A dark gray or a black cube inside of a clear sphere. Inside of a clear sphere? Yes, sir. And with no self-evident propulsion system? No wings, no IR energy coming off of the vehicle, nothing tethering it to the ground. And that was primarily what we were experiencing out there. I'm over time. Thank you very much for your service, and I yield back to Mr. Chairman. Very good. Mr. Burchett? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is for all three of y'all, starting with Mr. Grays. Why did you come forward on this issue? I came forward because I felt that my colleagues did not have a way to mitigate the safety threat, and I wanted to help them. I was trained as an aviation safety officer by the Navy, and this seemed, it just felt right. I felt like I had to help the folks that were still flying and dealing with this. Mr. Grush? Purely a sense of duty, my first sworn oath when I was a cadet 18 years ago, and I still uphold that even out of the uniform. Commander? I was pestered by a friend, and I asked why, and he said, you're the one person that they can't discredit, and you'll add credibility to the New York Times article, and so after about six times, I said, okay. This town isn't made, unfortunately, by people like y'all. We thank y'all, and I do want to also thank the people in the audience and the people that are watching this that can't be, people all over the world that have kept this issue alive. You've endured criticism and derogatory remarks, and we're trying to get to the bottom of it, and so God bless y'all. Thank y'all so much. We really appreciate you guys and gals. That's why we need term limits. Y'all keep clapping, those politicians just keep talking, so. Let me ask y'all, how can the public contribute to UAP reporting, and what avenues you think are available to the public to report these sightings? Well, right now, I don't think there is a lot of public options for every man to be able to report on this. I think even for professionals that have sensor data, that are seeing these on a regular basis, they're still hesitant to come forward, and so for the general public, I think encouraging the conversations that we're having today, looking for technology solutions that can be distributed, so that objective data can be gathered, is the first place to go. Mr. Goresh? I'll just touch on the whistleblower side of it. I do encourage, you know, current and former military, intelligence community, and industry contractors to come forward in a legal way, either through the IC or DOD or whatever the cognizant IGs are, to lead, you know, join me in this discussion. Commander, and I guess I should say this, for the record, my daddy was United States Marine Corps, 1st Marine Division, so. Hoorah. Yes, sir. He was old school, him and Chesty Puller on Peleliu, so thank you, brother. Wow. Yes, sir. I'm not, I'm not anything like my daddy. He was incredible. I'm very mediocre, to say the least, but go ahead. You seem to be doing fine. Yeah. For me, you know, I was an accident investigator, so the biggest thing that you learn, and I think that witnesses need to do is, one, don't try and make the fish bigger than it was. Stick to the facts, write it down, and don't speculate what you think it is, because it will sway your decision. Just write the facts down. We can get all the facts together, and we can start to investigate and get a real honest story instead of, it was this big. Thank you, Allen. I want to thank everybody. We made history today. Mr. Chairman, I yield. Thank you much, Mr. Garcia. Thank you. I know now we're going to be making some closing remarks, and so I just wanted to say a few things. First, to our witnesses, I want to thank all of you for being here with us today. I know that it takes a lot of courage. You're telling really important information to this committee, and I just want to thank you also for all three of you, your service to our country. I also want to just note that today's hearing was both important but also serious, and I want to thank our subcommittee chairman, Mr. Groffman, I think, for running a very fair and substantive hearing. I do want to thank the committee staff on both sides for the amount of work that it took to put this hearing in place, and certainly to all the members that have been involved in this issue prior to the hearing.
