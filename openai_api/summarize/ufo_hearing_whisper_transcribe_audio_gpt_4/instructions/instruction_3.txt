Lieutenant Ryan Graves, a former Navy F-18 pilot and executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, argues that UAP sightings are frequently witnessed by military and commercial pilots but often go unreported due to fear of professional consequences. He stresses the importance of transparency and the declassification of UAP information in order to advance our understanding of these phenomena and combat speculation. Graves also shares his own experience encountering a UAP during a mission, highlighting the lack of official acknowledgment and the need to address the safety and security concerns surrounding UAPs.

OK. I would also like to add, from a commercial aviation and military aviation perspective, we deal with uncertainty in our operating space as a matter of our professional actions. Identifying friend from foe is very important to us. And so when we have unidentified targets and we continue to ignore those due to a stigma or a fear of what it could be, that's an opening that our adversaries can take advantage of. What steps should we take to better understand and respond to UAP encounters? What steps should we take to better understand and respond to UAP encounters in the interest of national security? There needs to be a location where this information is centralized for processing, and there needs to be a two-way communication loop so the operators on the front end have a feedback and can get best practices on how to process information, what to do, and to ensure that their reporting is being listened to. Right now, there is not a lot of back and forth. Mr. Grush, in your complaint to the intelligence community and Inspector General, you claim that you believe information is being hidden. What kind of information do you think was hidden and do you think it should remain hidden? Yes, I can speak to that very briefly in an unclassified manner, as the preponderance of my complaint was classified to the intelligence communities. Both material acquisition and exploitation activity, also baselining the UAPs but not sharing it with intelligence professionals that are actually doing step briefs to pilots, that kind of information. OK. Thank you very much. Now we'll go to Mr. Garcia. Thank you. Again, thank you all for your service and for testifying today. I want to just talk about the UAPs as it relates to what we're seeing in pilots' interaction with UAPs, particularly Mr. Graves. One of the concerns for members of this committee is this idea that pilots, there's no system to actually report UAPs and the stigma around pilots. And so can you just briefly, you mentioned you're working with 30 pilots right now that have had encounters with UAPs. But you've also, I believe, discussed and know of many more pilots. This is just those that you're currently working with. Is that correct? Can you expand on that? Certainly. I'll break that down in two ways. First, when we were first experiencing these objects off the eastern seaboard in the 2014 to 2015 time period, anyone that had upgraded their radar systems were seeing these objects. So there was a large number of my colleagues that were detecting these objects off the eastern seaboard. They were further correlating that information with their other onboard sensors. And many of them also had their own eye sightings as well of these objects. Now, that was our personal firsthand experience at the time. Since then, as I've engaged this topic, others have reached out to me to share their experiences, both on the military side, as well as the commercial aviation side. On the military aviation side, veterans that have recently got out have shared their stories and have expressed how the objects we were seeing in 2014, 2015, continued all the way to 2019, 2020 and beyond. And so it became a generational issue for Naval aviators on the Eastern Seaboard. This was something we were briefing to new students. This is something that was included in the notice to airmen to ensure that there was no accidents. And now with commercial aviators, they are reaching out because they're having somewhat similar experiences as our military brothers and sisters, but they do not have any reporting system that they can send this to. And let me just add, and both to Mr. Fravor, as well as Mr. Graves, not having the system for reporting, would you both agree that it's harmful to not just our national security interests, but to understand this phenomenon of what's happening with UAPs? I think it's actually, it's a travesty that we don't have a system to correlate this and actually investigate. So if you took the East Coast, there's coastal radars out there that monitor our air defense identification zone, so out to 200 miles, they can track these. So when you see them, they could actually go and pull that data and get maneuvering. And instead of just having the airplanes, there's other data sources out there. And I've talked to other government officials on this. So you need a centrally located repository that these reports go to. So if you just stuck it in DOD, you wouldn't get anything out of the Intelligence Committee because they have a tendency not to talk. But if you had a central location where these reports would come in, not just military, but also commercial aviation, because there's a lot of that going on, especially if you talk to anyone that flies from here to Hawaii, over the Pacific, they see odd lights. So I think you need to develop something that allows you a central point to collect the data in order to investigate. Mr. Graves. I would concur with everything Mr. Fravor said. I'll continue to say that the commercial pilots that have reached out to me through Americans for Safe Aerospace are doing so because they don't feel there's another way for them to report this safety issue. And I think one of the clear outcomes of this hearing already is that there has to be a safe and transparent reporting process for pilots, both on the commercial side and the military side to be able to report UAPs in a way that's also transparent, but also understands the scope of our national security interests and what may be classified or not. But I think there has to be some sort of system. So that's something that I hope can be an outcome that this committee can work on. Is there anything else for just the two of you briefly beyond the reporting system that you think that we can do as a government to encourage and facilitate more civilian reporting? I think we're doing it right now. Okay, great. I think this hearing is going to show the American people that their government takes this topic seriously. And how about civilians that may not be pilots? What kind of process could be in place for civilians who are not pilots, who may have UAP encounters? Do either of you have any suggestions that could facilitate that? My recommendations would be to make that a sensor-centric operation in order to make it as objective as possible. Okay. Sir, is there a favor? No, I agree with Mr. Graves on that. Okay. Just briefly, I also just want to note for, particularly for the two pilots, I have a question for Mr. Grush. One of the things that I found fascinating in our discussion with Mr. Graves last night as well is that you both described UAPs and formations and the way they are observed in space or in our air, and the way that they move is essentially ways in which current technology or aircraft that we know of are unable to actually function or move. And so will you just, for the public record, again, once again, just briefly, just either describe or note that aircraft that are being witnessed, particularly by the 30 folks that you're working with, are essentially outside the scope of anything that we know of today and the technology we have today. Mr. Graves, Mr. Fravor? Yes, the objects that are being seen by commercial pilots are performing maneuvers that are unexplainable due to our current understanding of our technology and our capabilities as a country, and that applies for the military as well. Mr. Fravor? Yeah, I concur with that. We have nothing that can stop in midair and go the other direction, nor do we have anything that can, like in our situation, come down from space, hang out for three hours, and go back up. Thank you. My last question, and sometimes I know you have also said some of these answers in the past, but we're trying to get them on the public record as well, which is really important. Mr. Grish, finally, do you believe that our government is in possession of UAPs? Absolutely, based on interviewing over 40 witnesses over four years. And where? I know the exact locations, and those locations were provided to the Inspector General, and some of which to the Intelligence Committees. I actually had the people with the firsthand knowledge provide a protected disclosure to the Inspector General. Thank you, and Mr. Chairman, I would just say I think that these questions are important questions, and I look forward to being involved in the process to get those answered. I know there'll be a lot of questions from other committee members, so I yield back. Thank you. We'll go to Mr. Richard himself. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Garcia. I would like to have you on my legislation to do just that on the reporting, and we'll get together on that. Maybe you can be my co-sponsor on that. That'd be really cool. Thank you for those great questions. Mr. Graves, again, I'd like to know, how do you know that these were not our aircraft? Some of the behaviors that we saw in a working area, we would see these objects being at 0.0 mach. That's zero airspeed over certain pieces of the ground. So what that means, just like a river, if you throw a bobber in, it's gonna float downstream. These objects were staying completely stationary in category four hurricane winds. These same objects would then accelerate to supersonic speeds, 1.1, 1.2 mach, and they would do so in very erratic and quick behaviors that I don't have an explanation for. Okay, have you spoken to commercial and military pilots that have seen these off of our east coast? I have. Okay. Mr. Fravor, I noticed that in the Tic Tac video, it's Tic Tac, like the candy, not Tic Tac, like the Chinese communist app. That's correct. Yes, sir, I just wanna make that, because my daughter corrected me on that and called me a boomer and said, hey, boomer. And I said, no, baby, it's Tic Tac, like the candy. You're gonna have to just look it up. And, but now I would also like to say, today is a day of many firsts. It's a miracle that we're having this meeting. And it's also a miracle that my wife has put up with me for nine years today. Today is my anniversary. So I wanna tell my wife, happy anniversary, and that I love her very much. As she likes to say, this nine years have been the best two years of her life. So, thank you. Mr. Fravor, what astonished you the most about the flight capabilities of these Tic Tac, very briefly? The performance, absolute performance. And you're not aware of any other objects that anybody in the world has, in this world, that has those capabilities? No, I think it's far beyond, actually, our material science that we currently possess. Are you aware of any other reconnaissance platforms that have tracked or recorded the Tic Tac's maneuvers, maybe the NORAD system or any of the others? I am not. Okay. Mr. Grush, thank you for being here, brother. Thank you all very much. Have you faced any retaliation or reprisals for any of your testimony or anything on these lines? Yeah, I have to be careful what I say in detail because there is an open whistleblower reprisal investigation on my behalf, and I don't wanna compromise that investigation by providing anything that may help provide somebody information. But it was very brutal and very unfortunate, some of the tactics they used to hurt me both professionally and personally, to be quite frank. It's very unfortunate, as they say, when you're off the target, that's when they do the most firing at you. Do you have any personal knowledge of people who've been harmed or injured in efforts to cover up or conceal these extraterrestrial technology? Yes. Personally. Have anyone been murdered that you know of or have heard of, I guess? I have to be careful asking that question. Directed people with that knowledge to the appropriate authorities. Maybe if we could get in a confidential area, a SCIF, we could talk about that, but unfortunately, we were denied access to the SCIF, and that's very unfortunate in this scenario. Mr. Faber, do you believe that you witnessed an additional object under the water in relation to your encounter? I will say we did not see an object. There was something there to cause the whitewater, and when we turned around, it was gone, so there was something there that obviously moved. Okay, it was not the same object, though, that you were looking at, correct? No, we actually joked that the TICTAC was communicating with something when we came back, and because the whitewater disappeared. We were, in another instance, were told about the capabilities of a jamming during viewing when there were some people chasing some of these objects. Did you experience any of that jamming or interrupting your radar or weapons system? My crew that launched after we landed experienced significant jamming to the APG-73 radar, which was what we had on board, which is a mechanically scanned, very high-end system prior to the APG-79, and yes, it did pretty much everything you could do, range, velocity, aspect, and then it spit the lock, and the targeting pod is passive. That's what we were able to get the video on. I'm about to run out of time, but are you aware of any of our enemies that have that capability? No. Okay, I would also like to note for the record that like George Knapp, breaking Area 51, he's the reason I knew about that, and the reason I know about the TICTACs is Leslie Keene from New York Times article, and I would encourage everybody to read that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back to you for no time. Very good. Mr. Raskin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Graves, you reported UAP encounters during training flights, I think, and have since come forward to warn the Pentagon that these encounters may be putting pilots at risk. My first question is, you've identified these as taking place on the East Coast. Is it just on the East Coast where these encounters have been reported? No, since the events initially occurred, I've learned that the objects have been detected essentially where all operations, Navy operations are being conducted across the world, and that's from the All Domain Anomaly Resolutions Office reporting.
