Lieutenant Ryan Graves, a former Navy F-18 pilot and executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, argues that UAP sightings are frequently witnessed by military and commercial pilots but often go unreported due to fear of professional consequences. He stresses the importance of transparency and the declassification of UAP information in order to advance our understanding of these phenomena and combat speculation. Graves also shares his own experience encountering a UAP during a mission, highlighting the lack of official acknowledgment and the need to address the safety and security concerns surrounding UAPs.
