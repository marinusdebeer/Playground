Lieutenant Ryan Graves, who is a former Navy F-18 pilot and executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, believes that there is a lack of transparency and declassification of information regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). He argues that UAP sightings are frequently witnessed by military and commercial pilots but often go unreported due to fear of professional consequences. Graves emphasizes the need for a centralized reporting system and better communication to properly document and address UAP sightings. He shares his own experience encountering a UAP and highlights the lack of official acknowledgment and the need to address safety and security concerns. Graves and others also discuss ongoing safety risks and the need for transparency and clarity in reporting on UAP phenomena. They express concerns about corporate interests prioritizing reputation over public safety and suggest potential misappropriation of funds and government involvement in a disinformation campaign.
