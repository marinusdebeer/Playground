The Subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) begins with the Chair calling the meeting to order and welcoming everyone. It is stated that the Chair may declare a recess at any time and that certain members are waived onto the subcommittee for the purpose of participating in the hearing. The Chair announces that both the Chair and Ranking Member will have 10 minutes for opening remarks, and they may give some of their time to other members. 

The Chair, in their opening remarks, acknowledges the witnesses for their bravery in sharing their stories about engaging with UAPs and expresses gratitude for their dedication to safeguarding the interests of the American people. The lack of transparency regarding UAPs is discussed, along with the speculation and wild debate it has fueled over the years, eroding public trust in institutions meant to protect them. The establishment of entities like the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and NASA's independent study on UAPs is mentioned, but it is noted that there is a pressing demand for transparency and accountability from the government. The handling of the Chinese spy balloon incident and subsequent UAP events by the Biden administration is criticized for its lack of transparency and clarity. The need for Congress to ensure government efficiency, openness, and transparency when it comes to UAPs is emphasized. The Chair concludes by stating that the hearing is not just about debating the existence of UAPs, but also about the principles of transparency and accountability that define the republic. 

Representative Burchett from Tennessee delivers his opening remarks and stresses that UAPs are a nonpartisan issue that goes beyond party politics. He expresses gratitude to his colleagues and individuals like George Knapp and Jeremy Korbel for their support and contributions to understanding UAPs. He highlights the dismissive attitude of the military towards UAPs, as well as the difficulty in bringing this issue to a hearing and facing roadblocks from the intelligence community and Pentagon. Representative Burchett emphasizes the importance of government transparency, reminds the audience that the government works for the people, and calls for an end to the cover-up surrounding UAPs. He thanks the witnesses for their bravery and urges prayers for them and their families. 

Representative Luna from Florida begins her opening remarks by stating that the circumstances surrounding UAPs have captivated the attention of the American people for decades, and that there is a lack of transparency by the government regarding UAPs. She cites polls indicating that the majority of Americans believe the government is hiding information about UAPs and that there is a failure to address the concerns of eyewitnesses, including service members who fear retribution for coming forward. Representative Luna emphasizes the need for an open-minded discussion on UAPs and calls for the release of more information to the American people. 

The Ranking Member Garcia thanks the witnesses for their service and courage in sharing their experiences. He emphasizes the bipartisan nature of the hearing and its relevance to national security. He acknowledges that UAPs pose a serious safety threat and highlights the role of the oversight committee in ensuring transparency and faith in government institutions. He mentions previous reporting on UAPs by the Defense Intelligence Agency and the media.  

Overall, the summary provides an overview of the opening remarks made by the Chair, Representative Burchett, Representative Luna, and the Ranking Member Garcia during the Subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). The importance of transparency, accountability, and government efficiency in dealing with UAPs is highlighted, as well as the need to address public concerns and ensure national security.
Lieutenant Ryan Graves, a former Navy F-18 pilot and executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, begins his opening statement by highlighting three critical issues regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). First, he states that UAP sightings are not rare or isolated, but rather routine and underreported. He mentions that military aircrew and commercial pilots frequently witness UAP but often do not report them due to the stigma and fear of professional repercussions. Second, Graves emphasizes the need for transparency and the declassification of UAP information. He points out that excessive classification practices hinder our understanding of UAP and fuel speculation and mistrust. He notes that all UAP videos since 2021 are classified as secret or above, which impedes progress in understanding the phenomena. Lastly, Graves shares his personal experience as an F-18 pilot, encountering UAP that were officially unacknowledged. He describes an incident where two F-18 Super Hornets were split by a UAP described as a black cube inside a clear sphere, which came within 50 feet of the lead aircraft. The mission was terminated, and a safety report was submitted, but there was no further acknowledgement of the incident. Graves concludes by stating that his organization, Americans for Safe Aerospace, has collected testimonies from over 30 witnesses, many of whom are commercial pilots, and emphasizes the urgent need to address the security and safety concerns surrounding UAP.
Lieutenant Ryan Graves, a former Navy F-18 pilot and executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, raises three key points in his opening statement during the Subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs).

Lieutenant Ryan Graves, a former Navy F-18 pilot and executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, stresses the importance of transparency and the declassification of UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) information. He argues that UAP sightings are frequently witnessed by military and commercial pilots but often go unreported due to fear of professional consequences. He emphasizes the need for a centralized reporting system and two-way communication loop to ensure that UAP sightings are properly documented and addressed. Graves also shares his own experience encountering a UAP during a mission and highlights the lack of official acknowledgment and the need to address safety and security concerns surrounding UAPs.
Lieutenant Ryan Graves discusses his decision to go public with his experience and the ongoing safety risks associated with UAP sightings. He emphasizes the need for transparency and a reporting system that can provide clarity on these phenomena. Lieutenant Graves and Mr. Grush both reflect on the support they have received as well as the intimidation and reprisals they have faced for speaking out. They express concerns about corporate interests prioritizing their reputation over public safety.
