Lieutenant Ryan Graves, a former Navy F-18 pilot and executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, stresses the importance of transparency and the declassification of UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) information. He argues that UAP sightings are frequently witnessed by military and commercial pilots but often go unreported due to fear of professional consequences. He emphasizes the need for a centralized reporting system and two-way communication loop to ensure that UAP sightings are properly documented and addressed. Graves also shares his own experience encountering a UAP during a mission and highlights the lack of official acknowledgment and the need to address safety and security concerns surrounding UAPs.
