Lieutenant Ryan Graves and Mr. Grush testify about their encounters with Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) and the lack of transparency surrounding these incidents. Lieutenant Graves shares a specific incident where he and other pilots witnessed a sequence of four craft in a clear diamond formation, which is similar to a radar sequence observed by him in the United States Congress. One pilot approached the craft and encountered a large orb-like object that disabled their radar and FLIR system. Lieutenant Graves expresses concern about the capabilities of these UAPs and the need for more understanding about their operations. He also highlights the culture of intimidation and suppression faced by pilots who report such incidents. Mr. Grush proposes taking steps to address this issue, including secure meetings and sharing radar images. Ms. Mace asks about repercussions faced by pilots who report UAP encounters and raises the possibility of a government disinformation campaign. She also questions the percentage of unreported UAP sightings and the seriousness with which the Navy handles such incidents. Mr. Langworthy asks Commander Fravor about his encounter with a Tic Tac-shaped object and the lack of propulsion and thermal exhaust. He also questions whether the US or any other nation could have created such a craft. The text concludes with Mr. Alvarez expressing gratitude to the witnesses for their testimony and their bravery in coming forward.
