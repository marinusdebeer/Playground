Lieutenant Ryan Graves, a former Navy F-18 pilot and executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, begins his opening statement by highlighting three critical issues regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). First, he states that UAP sightings are not rare or isolated, but rather routine and underreported. He mentions that military aircrew and commercial pilots frequently witness UAP but often do not report them due to the stigma and fear of professional repercussions. Second, Graves emphasizes the need for transparency and the declassification of UAP information. He points out that excessive classification practices hinder our understanding of UAP and fuel speculation and mistrust. He notes that all UAP videos since 2021 are classified as secret or above, which impedes progress in understanding the phenomena. Lastly, Graves shares his personal experience as an F-18 pilot, encountering UAP that were officially unacknowledged. He describes an incident where two F-18 Super Hornets were split by a UAP described as a black cube inside a clear sphere, which came within 50 feet of the lead aircraft. The mission was terminated, and a safety report was submitted, but there was no further acknowledgement of the incident. Graves concludes by stating that his organization, Americans for Safe Aerospace, has collected testimonies from over 30 witnesses, many of whom are commercial pilots, and emphasizes the urgent need to address the security and safety concerns surrounding UAP.
