The subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), referred to in less scientific circles as UFOs, began with the Chair calling the meeting to order, extending a warm welcome to everyone in attendance. It was laid out at the onset that the Chair had the authority to declare a recess at any given time, and that some members had been waived onto the subcommittee specifically to participate in this hearing.

During these opening remarks, time allocations were announced, the subcommittee Chair and Ranking Member allotted ten minutes each for their introductory addresses. They had the option to share this time with others if they so chose. In the Chair's speech, the witnesses were acknowledged for their courage in sharing their stories and thanked for their unwavering dedication to protecting the interests of the American public. 

The Chair touched on the prevailing issue of the non-disclosure surrounding UAPs, a challenging matter that has led to serious speculation and exacerbated public mistrust in institutions deemed to provide protection over the years. Despite attempts by agencies like the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and NASA's independent research on UAPs to address the issue, it was asserted that the demands from the public for government transparency and accountability remain largely unanswered. The Biden administration's lack of clarity and transparency on this matter, as seen during the handling of the Chinese spy balloon incident and subsequent UAP events, came under criticism. It was emphasized that Congress needs to work harder in ensuring openness, transparency, and governmental efficiency, especially when dealing with UAPs.

Representative Burchett of Tennessee used his allotted time to stress that UAPs are not a partisan matter. He thanked his colleagues and supportive individuals such as George Knapp and Jeremy Korbel, whose contributions have helped in understanding UAPs. He also criticized the military's dismissive attitude towards UAPs, referencing the difficulty in pushing this issue to a congressional hearing due to roadblocks from both the intelligence community and Pentagon. Calling for an end to the UAP cover-up, Burchett reminded everyone that the government should always work for the people.

Conversely, Representative Luna from Florida focused on the long-standing intrigue and lack of governmental transparency on matters related to UAPs. She stated that a majority of Americans believe that the government is hiding information about UAPs, indicating that concerns of eyewitnesses, especially those of service members fearing retribution, haven't been addressed properly. 

Bipartisan nature was at the forefront of Ranking Member Garcia's speech, paralleling his emphasis on the relevance of the hearing to national security. He acknowledged the significant safety threat posed by UAPs and the role of the oversight committee to instill faith in government institutions through transparency. 

During the hearing, several key points were made, one of which was that frequent sightings of UAPs often go unreported due to the fear of professional backlash. Lieutenant Ryan Graves, a former Navy F-18 pilot and current executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace called for more transparency and declassification of information pertaining to UAPs. Graves shared personal encounters with these phenomena and highlighted the drastic need for an understanding of the behaviors and operations of these phenomena, especially given their capabilities.

Despite numerous UAP sightings, many of these cases still lack official acknowledgment, intensifying public concern about the government's ability to ensure safety and security. Intimidation and lack of transparency were also expressed as common frustrations faced by those who come forward with their reports, including the possibility of government-led disinformation campaigns creating further complications.

Given the serious implications of these phenomena for national security and public information, the subcommittee concluded the hearing with an affirmation of the importance of ongoing investigations, public reporting, and accountability. The potential of legislation resulting from the hearing was acknowledged, along with the desire to make more information available to the public. As the meeting ended, members were given additional time to submit any unanswered questions, ensuring that the discussion around Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena continues well beyond the confines of the hearing.
