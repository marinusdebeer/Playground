The speaker acknowledges the witnesses' service and expresses gratitude for their testimony. Critics denounce President Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, citing the losses sustained throughout the 20-year conflict and the subsequent takeover by the Taliban. They suggest that the withdrawal was one of the worse experiences they'd had and reference the fallen soldiers, separated families, trillions spent, and now Taliban training bases as an indication of the mission's failure. The speaker supports the idea that lessons should be learned from the withdrawal. Colonel Crommer then discusses the mistakes made during the withdrawal and the aftermath.
