The US House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing regarding the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, discussing whether there had been enough planning and preparation. The session included testimony from service members and a Gold Star family (a family that has lost a member in military service). The committee recognized the service of the witnesses and thanked the families for their sacrifice. 

The committee discussed the preparedness and decision-making processes related to the withdrawal, with criticisms regarding a lack of adequate planning and ignoring potential consequences. There were also concerns raised about the lack of accountability for the deadly and embarrassing withdrawal, and if there had been a willful ignorance that resulted in needless loss of life. 

The hearing highlighted the decision to close down the Bagram military base in Afghanistan, which some argued led to the disastrous situation in Kabul. Members of the committee pressed for a more detailed unpacking of how these decisions were made, and made a commitment to fight for accountability. 

There was also disagreement about comments made by President Biden and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin about the withdrawal, with some members arguing their statements were misrepresented. Some members also criticized the committee's majority for not calling current administration officials to testify. There was recognition that while mistakes were made, the situation was complex and decisions were made with the information available at the time. 

As a result of the hearing, members committed to ensuring that lessons are learned from this operation to better conduct future military actions.
