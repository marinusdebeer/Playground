The House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a joint meeting where they questioned several experts regarding the U.S.'s military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the actions that led to it. Among those questioned were Command Sergeant Major (Ret.) Eddie Smith, Colonel Mark V. Krumich and Dr. Christopher Kolenda. The meeting centred around the question of whether the decision to withdraw was advisable and whether it might have been handled better.

C.S.M. Smith spoke of meeting with a U.S. embassy site survey team and advising against the use of H Kaya, a position that he later said was not taken into consideration. He also suggested that a larger military presence might have been desirable at H Kaya to stave off the approaching Taliban.

Colonel Krumich reiterated several times throughout the meeting that the execution of the military withdrawal, while successful, did not go as planned due to the lack of cooperation from the Taliban. He stated that the Biden administration ignored the advice of several four-star generals leading to the situations that caused the deaths of several service members in Afghanistan.

Dr. Kolenda stated that there needs to be a national security doctrine in the U.S., as well as an individual in charge of U.S. efforts on the ground during wartime, to prevent the level of miscommunication and lack of coordination that occurred during the Afghan withdrawal. He also called for clearer terms for war termination and the creation of an expert body of knowledge on executing wartime negotiations.

The speakers also addressed other subjects, such as the repercussions of the Doha agreement, the possible expansion of the Afghan adjustment agreement to increase the number of visas provided to Afghans, and the question of whether the withdrawal might have been carried out more effectively.
