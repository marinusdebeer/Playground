The House subcommittee on International Development, International Organizations, and Global Corporate Social Impact hearing focused on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The witnesses, who were involved in the planning and implementation of the withdrawal, included Colonel Seth Krummrich, Colonel Christopher D. Kolenda, and Command Sergeant Major Jacob Smith. The concerns raised during the hearing included a failure to follow the Doha agreement, a selective use of intelligence to support predetermined strategies, poor timing for the withdrawal during the Talibanâ€™s fighting season, and inadequate time for the Department of Defense and agencies to plan and execute the withdrawal. The panelists also noted the impact of hurried withdrawal tactics, which they argued undermined the morale of the Afghan military and facilitated the Taliban's return to power. They recommended thorough oversight and revisions to policy and strategy to prevent repeating past failures in future military interventions.
