The House subcommittee on International Development, International Organizations, and Global Corporate Social Impact discussed issues centered around the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Key witnesses included Colonel Seth Krummrich, Colonel Christopher D. Kolenda, and Command Sergeant Major Jacob Smith. Primary points of contention included the violation of the Doha agreement, misapplication of intelligence, withdrawal timing coinciding with the Talibanâ€™s fighting season, and insufficient planning time for the Department of Defense. There were suggestions that hastened withdrawal strategies demoralized the Afghan military and promoted the Taliban's return to power, with recommendations for policy and strategy updates to avoid similar failures in future interventions.

In a joint meeting between The House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, experts were questioned on the U.S.'s military withdrawal from Afghanistan. Witnesses included Command Sergeant Major (Ret.) Eddie Smith, Colonel Mark V. Krumich, and Dr. Christopher Kolenda. The experts considered the withdrawal ill-advised and poorly managed.

During the meeting, Smith mentioned a disregarded advice against using H Kaya. Krumich stated that the withdrawal didn't proceed as planned due to non-cooperation from the Taliban, adding that the Biden administration ignored advice from four-star generals leading to service members' deaths in Afghanistan. Dr. Kolenda stressed the need for a national security doctrine and the appointment of a person in charge of U.S. efforts on the ground during wartime. He also suggested clearer war termination terms and an expert body to oversee wartime negotiations.

Several other issues were discussed at the hearing, including the repercussions of the Doha agreement, potential expansion of the Afghan adjustment agreement, and more effective execution of the withdrawal. The witnesses were applauded for their service, and criticism emerged about President Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan due to the losses sustained during and after the 20-year conflict. The witnesses sought accountability and adjustments to failed policies in future military interventions. 

The hearing concluded highlighting a lack of discipline, planning, accountability, and support during the Afghanistan withdrawal, expressing strong disappointment and dissatisfaction from the witnesses regarding the perceived lack of leadership and foresight from military and government leaders.
 
In another hearing by the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, criticisms were made concerning inadequate planning and ignoring potential consequences. Inadequacy of accountability for the controversial withdrawal, and the decision to close down the Bagram military base, which allegedly led to the Kaboul disaster, were noted. While statements from President Biden and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin were contested, members acknowledged the complexity of the situation and committed to learning from the operation for better future military actions.
