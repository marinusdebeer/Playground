that it was never much of a country I went to the so-called Palace and I was underwhelmed by the facility that the king had occupied so it doesn't surprise me that it that 20 years later we still had problems during that time I saw rapid corruption including Karzai who he and his brother raped the country of a number of phrase that raped the American taxpayers of billions of dollars we can talk for as long as as anyone is allowed about the failures of Afghanistan but I do want to talk about the subject Azure here for a moment sergeant major you uh you laid out the difference in the facilities one which was defendable one which was able to almost occupy a Siege if necessary but if I'm correct would have required some flexibility in the number of Personnel in other words if you have a mandate of less than a thousand and they have to include the embassy then you really don't have the flexibility to use uh bogram is that correct sir Bagram that being such a large military installation it had 84 guard towers and that takes a significant amount of manpower to man so given maybe double the amount 2 000 or so you could have defended that that error base and that's 2 000 not including the people operating aircraft and other things that might have been left there but Bagram could have been maintained and would have been safer had we had some flexibility from the commander-in-chief as to the number of uh uh a Personnel correct sir if you had 2 000 people Bagram would be a much safer location okay uh Colonels uh I'll I'll address you together for a moment you both went to the war colleges you you both went command and general staff so I'm going to go through a little quick history I'll try to be as quick as possible during Vietnam the now 100 year old Henry Kissinger negotiated what some would call a flawed agreement you know they they had these peace agreements but both during the the time and afterwards isn't it true that when Richard Nixon saw failures to comply saw aggression saw an attempt to take ground by his adversaries being the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong he bombed the out of him is that correct using a technical military term am I am I not remembering history that if if you're non-compliant with it that the commander-in-chief uses his or her authority to essentially let them know that there was a consequence for not obeying an agreement that is my recollection okay so knowing that the commander-in-chief had a history in what people often call that failed withdrawal of Saigon which by the way was long after we had left and our military had left uh and it and it really was a post period we certainly uh could have a discussion about you know failure to to plan a Neo sufficient I'd like to just go on to one other uh Benghazi there are similarities with Benghazi which seems to be there was no plan to withdraw the military didn't know who could do it and the like and the facilities were insufficient in the investigation of Benghazi what did we find we found that the facilities chosen the facilities in which the Ambassador was hunkered down were not compliant with any state department requirements in fact he died because the fuel tank was right next to where he was supposed to be in a safe house so sergeant major I'm going to come back to you the actual loss of 160 human beings plus and 13 of our service members can it be reasonably attributed to the difference in facilities chosen between Bagram versus hkaya so the events that happen on Abby gate um I believe that if that would have that would not have occurred in Bagram the defense that Bagram held the ability to see for you know hundreds of meters and the defense in depth of those control points I do not believe the result would have been the same okay I'm not going to defend the work of the Secretary of State Pompeo in the Doha agreement but I will ask uh Colonel I think I'll start with you am I correct that there roughly were sort of nine months and nine months nine months of the Trump Administration followed by nine months of nearly nine months of the Biden Administration each of each of them had nine months more or less to make decisions on that that plan what would you say were the uh the Fatal flaws during that first nine months did for example the Trump Administration withdraw troops to an artificially low level did they signal in a way that would cause people to uh to evacuate in in you know go through just quickly were their actions during the Trump Administration that you can say absolutely led to the events that cost 13 members lives that you can you can point to today not during the Trump Administration I I don't see a direct causation during that time period and wasn't there during that next nine months plenty of times to make adjustments based on the actions of the Taliban during that next nine or so months in my opinion there was time to make adjustments and were there any adjustments made that you know of during that period of time that said to the Taliban that there would be consequences for their violations no and that was our failure in the Doha agreement we did not hold them accountable to meeting those conditions yet we continue to withdraw okay lastly the closing the the release at the time of that five to seven thousand uh bad guys if you will was that related to the agreement or was that inherently related to the closing of Bagram I suppose I don't know the answer to that question well were they released essentially simultaneous with the closing of the air base sergeant major you were probably the closest to knowing the time schedule sir I do not know the timeline okay uh we'll take that one to find out later Mr chairman thank you very much for your Indulgence thank you Mr ice at this point we'll recognize the gentle lady from Pennsylvania Miss Dean for five minutes good morning thank you chairman and thank you ranking member Crow I thank you our Witnesses for testifying today and of course even more thank you for your service to our country I also recognize the service members in the audience veterans and service members as well as gold star Families my heart is with you our gratitude is with you and it's something we can never repay this 20-year War cost our country so much and while the end was devastatingly heartbreaking we could not continue to send Americans to fight a war no longer in our Vital National interest we owe a tremendous debt to the more than 2400 U.S service members killed in the more than 20 20 000 wounded during the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan and we are here to understand what happened and importantly to learn how do we do better in the future as my Democratic colleagues have said August 2021 did not happen in a vacuum this was a 20-year war and to understand that what happened we need to look at the broader context Colonel crumrich you testified in response to a question from my colleague Mr Kim that prudent steps were taken in 2020 to start withdrawing troops but later when we saw that the conditions weren't being met by the Taliban General Milly and others ceased the drawdown but isn't it true in January of 2021 president Trump further Drew Down U.S troops just days before the change of Administrations I would have to go back and look I don't know the specific answer to that question I believe it is I think maybe Drew down to 2500 literally within days of what we would hope was a peaceful transfer of power do you believe that President Trump knew that the Taliban was not meeting the Doha deal yes which is why there was a halt on the withdrawal in late 2020. and yet a continued withdrawal in January just days before he was to leave office I would have to go back and look at those numbers if you would provide those to the committee that would be really helpful and I think we need the record to be as clear as possible for all of you what lessons should U.S civilian and military leaders take from this war Colonel kalenda at one as you point out what happened in Afghanistan is not unique there was Iraq before that was Vietnam I had two brothers who served during the Vietnam war in the Navy my eldest brother Bob served two terms two tours of Duty in Vietnam on destroyers and Hospital ships I remember as a little girl the devastation of that war and of course of the end of that war how do we prevent another such disaster colonel uh thank you congresswoman and I'm not sure if Minersville Pennsylvania is in your District but one of my Troopers Dave Boris is buried there at the at the cemetery thank you for telling me that I wrote this book zero-sum Victory what we're getting wrong about war to address the exact question that you that you posed I think there are a lot of different reforms that we need to make so we don't have a disaster like this occur again I identified a few of those in my written testimony to include we need the fact that we need to put somebody in charge on the ground in charge of all U.S forces we need a we need the state department to have develop an expert body of knowledge for conducting wartime negotiations in which we're a participant I found that the whole process leading up to the Doha agreement to be deeply troubling where instead of trying to focus on a deal and putting a total withdrawal of U.S troops on the table immediately as participants have told me it happened we should have have instead work this a bit more like the Northern Ireland peace agreement peace process where it was a step-by-step process testing The taliban's Bona fides and intentions to see if they would uphold their commitments and and then you got to make sure that you got accountability and somebody on the ground who is able to make those determinations about accountability um in in the event the adversary doesn't doesn't uphold their terms finally we need something just as basic as a national security Doctrine a set of terms and Concepts so we're all the same terms mean the same things to the same people we don't have that right now so DOD speaks one language state speaks a different language the intelligence Community speaks a third language and um and coordination uh good strategy good policy falls to the cracks I thank you and I see my time has expired again I thank you all for your service and and for those in the audience thank you also I yield back thank you Miss Dean at this point we'll uh recognize the gentleman from Tennessee uh Mr Green for five minutes I thank you chairman for leading this critical oversight tiering and I want to thank chairman Mast for his leadership uh continuing to hold the Biden administration's feet to the fire on one of the biggest strategic failures in American history I also want to thank the gold star families that are here uh thank them for their unprecedented sacrifice to our country I am confident that looking at my fellow veterans and leaders on this diocese we will finally get the record straight I also want to thank our Witnesses for their selfless service to our nation and the people of Afghanistan we will continue to look to your bravery and your Grace Under Pressure for inspiration in the decades to come I find it tragic that the other side keeps going back to the previous administration when we know that during that Administration the Taliban did not gain massive ground because they know he'd bombed the bombed them into Oblivion when the circumstances changed massively on the ground and the military commander said exfil from Bagram Biden told Milly no it's that simple and mistakes made throughout the 20-year 20 years of our time in Afghanistan do not justify stupidity in the end they just don't any other wrong doesn't make a right as I did during the full committee Foreign Affairs Hearing in March I want to say a word to my fellow Afghanistan veterans our service and our sacrifices were not in vain despite the Strategic mistakes made in Washington we kept America safe for a major from a major terrorist attack for over 20 years no one who served and like myself lost friends should ever allow these mistakes we are addressing today to detract in any way from those sacrifices we protected America for 20 years please know accountability is coming my own combat deployment in Afghanistan Illustrated to me the importance of teamwork and dedication to the mission at hand particularly when it comes to planning in Afghanistan we always had our fellow soldiers back no matter what it took and no matter the personal costs we took care of our own including our Afghan brothers in arms because our mission to keep Afghanistan free and America safe required it in one of The Darkest Hours of American foreign policy you all stood in the breach to save the lives of vulnerable American citizens and our Afghan allies from The Vicious Taliban you didn't let the mission down even when the politicians did you were left without proper direction or support from your commander-in-chief but you didn't let that deter you you all stood up and have continued to do so in a way that our state department has been unable or unwilling to do so for two weeks in August of 2021 we basically had no State Department in Afghanistan our active duty service members and our veterans did the essential security and humanitarian work on the ground proving once again that America's greatest resource in any challenge is our men and women in arms you all are a testament to the critical fact we have learned about the United States military and our veterans throughout the global war on terror that even when Washington fails you you rise to every occasion America thanks you for your dedication courage and hearts of service to your fellow man Sergeant Major Smith Command Sergeant Major Smith you testified that after bagram's closure only one single infantry company 113 U.S soldiers and two companies of partner forces was left in Afghanistan to protect hkaya can you give us the detail on how complicated this is and do you feel there was do you fill that number of troops with sufficient and why not Sir with the Turkish forces I need to preface with their involvement in this they manned one gate that that was their area of responsibility it was those the remaining 113 from that company that was responsible for the rest of of that Airfield that includes Manning all the gates and ecps that includes Manning all the towers and all the guard positions it was an exceptionally hard task and uh um there should have been more people there we know that General milley asked for more and was turned down um I have a question now for uh and I hope I'm pronouncing your name right colonel colonel comerick is that correct uh can you explain why you were incredulous to hear senior officials Express surprise at the swiftness of the Afghan government's collapse and the Taliban takeover I think there's there's two aspects to this the first was the underestimation of the taliban's capability over the last 20 years we saw them in 2001 that initial Taliban force was not very proficient compared to what I saw say 10 years later standing next to a bed in Walter Reed with a friend of mine who was a team sergeant that got caught in a green on Blue attack and he described to me the Thousand meter accurate firefights they were having with machine guns with the Taliban the Taliban were getting much much more lethal and it was only going to continue to rise they were improving and they were getting the logistics they needed the training they needed they were a real threat that was on the rise meanwhile on The Afghan government side I think it was crystallized eloquently by uh by Colonel Kalinda um the Afghan government had a kleptocracy had an issue all the way through that is preventing them from being able to achieve what they needed to achieve so you had this very strong Taliban that was always going to be a threat and to your point they were stuck in those 78 districts that were frankly pushed way out to the hinterland they weren't important areas um but once we Telegraph that we were going to leave and the pressure was then put on The Afghan military it was clear that that increasingly lethal Taliban were going to have a serious effect we left immediately absolutely spinning empty chair when our Afghan allies were looking around where did we go when the Red Storm was coming at them from the Taliban and at that point disaster followed I apologize I can't stay for the remainder of this Committee hearing and I'm over my time I'm the chairman of the committee on homeland security and I'm going to a classified briefing on the 14 000 Chinese Nationals who've poured across our Southern border mini with ties to the pla another tragic failure of this Administration so I must leave but thank you for your service to this country thank you so much Mr Green and thank you for your support as well and helping secure our borders you know I want to go back to a couple things that's been said throughout this uh by my colleagues on the left you know you have things where they say well there's no point in us rehashing this you know in the military we call something that's being rehashed as an AAR an after-action review and the whole point of conducting those after Action reviews is to one ensure that these types of incidents don't occur again but also to ensure that accountability is head is held and we can actually go forward and make sure the right people are there you also continue to hear well we need to look at it in its entirety over the last 20 plus years you know as someone who had served in the United States military so as a combat veteran like many of my colleagues who are up here when we take command and we basically go out on operations and those operations go wrong we don't look at the previous command and go well the previous command had them for the last two years and it's their training that happened in the past that's the reason for these actual incidents and mistakes but that's what they want to do to president Trump they want to say that well let's look at its entirety let's not talk about the Obama era let's not talk about the bush era Let's ignore August you know 26th which was under the Biden Administration let's just focus on President Trump I wonder if that has anything to do with the upcoming elections and the fact that he's ahead in the polls and we're playing politics which is why we're sitting here right now over strategy and over actually holding those accountable for the actions that they're responsible for you know I wasn't an officer I was a non-commissioned officer so I worked for a living and the commands of our major understands that all too well the one thing that we know is that when we deploy out whoever doesn't come home with us is on us we don't shuttle that responsibility and that blame on anyone that's exactly whatever it wants to do I want to also just comment on something real quick on August 31st of 2021 President Biden claimed that the Afghan withdrawal and to quote him was an extraordinary success you don't want to play a video if I may and then I want to ask that exact same question if you can please direct your attention [Music] now that was an American who is waving her passport at the gate that the Biden Administration that the department of state Secretary of Lincoln and secretary Austin claims was manned full-time an enablement of trying to help guarantee Americans free access and to quote biting how she said all you have to do is show your blue passport and we'll let you in he also tried to say that there was no chaos in regards to the withdrawal did that look structured as loved ones go through and look through body after body to try and find their deceased loved one who had passed did that look like proper Force protection like we would have found at Bagram Air Base that would have guaranteed the necessary standoff to Hesco barriers that was going to be provided the ability to house the sivs and P1 and P2 so we considered proper medical and Biometrics before just throwing people on an aircraft that they call the greatest successful operational airlift in history even though it's reported that almost 70 percent weren't even properly vetted do we call that an extraordinary success colonel that video is what failure looks like that is failure absolutely you're exactly right commissary major what would you say on that surrender the conditions that the United States military found themselves under I believe that in that chaos and Anarchy the military had a successful Mission the conditions were less than ideal though but to to your exact point and you're right the issue and I say this and I spent you know seven years of my life in Iraq over three years in Afghanistan Kosovo Pakistan Northern Somalia we'll see what roadside IEDs in 2006 in Baghdad twice once with an efp which we're all familiar with those aren't failures by the U.S military and those who are wearing the uniform it's the suits not the boots who are actually responsible for these types of failures and these collapses one of the reasons I ran for Congress because I got tired of people who sit here trying to make decisions that impact us as War fighters on the ground but yet they have no accountability no understanding and no actual on-ground experience themselves you know less than 17 percent of Congress is actually made up of veterans prior to this last election probably the reason why to your point Colonel uh colitis that we have continue to have strategic military failures time and time again this incident that occurred during the botched Afghan withdrawn of the body Administration was because they applied political Optics over military strategy but they're also responsible for that intelligence blindness that you talk about there was credible Intel that we know was provided day after day and I've looked at that in our skiff in the classified briefings and shown the day-to-day where it was giving an update on what was going to occur what was happening where the planning was planning's finished execution getting ready to happen and then August 26 happens and that's why we have 13 of our fallen heroes and 13 new gold star families and I'm here right now and proud and hold this in my pocket so I know I'm not here alone when I've got our young Corporal Sanchez his coin right here with me that was given by his family who I know is looking for the same accountability because his death was preventable but so was the Americans in that video I just showed you know we report our 13 Heroes but the thing that hasn't been reported was all the Americans who were on the other side of that gate waiting to get in whose families still don't have a clue where they're at the reason I know that there's more Americans there is because whenever I heard about what was going on in Afghanistan Congressman Ronnie Jackson called me and told me about a mother and three children that were trapped in Afghanistan that are his Amarillo Texas born and raised natives and he tried to reach out to the state department to get support and they told him well we'll call and see where they're at he's a rear Admiral as well and when he called the dod they told him they couldn't do anything they were in the midst of a withdrawal so I put a team together of former Squadron members and I had the great support of a friend of mine Glenn Devitt from The Sentinel Foundation who we put a team together and flew over there and actually conducted the first successful Overland rescue why was it over land because the Biden administration had thwarted our efforts on three different occasions to rescue Americans even though we had an aircraft that was scheduled to pick up 28 Americans and fly him out you know it's interesting to me when I talk about the Americans on the other side where they're not admitting to them because one was a woman that we were in contact with with her two-year-old son and her father who are Americans who we were in contact with and told to meet at Abby gate who had rehearsed our entire policy of what we were going to do in our operational uh I guess our opcon white paper if you will and when we found out that we weren't going to be able able to come in there and we had to reroute we asked everyone to leave but she still text and told us she thought that she can still get in that was August 26th and when we tried to reach out to her again we never heard from her again so very likely another American and her son who's dead you know you also talked and Colonel I want to just clarify this for the record when we talked about this metric based withdrawal the Doha agreement it was very clear that if the metric was not met the agreement was not met that we were not obligated to remove everyone is that correct that's my understanding and it also prior to president Trump leaving office when he was advised by his generals that we should not go to a zero-sum game of just pulling out everyone and we need to leave advisors behind so that our Afghan Partners can be ready to repel because as we've pointed out they started getting better then he actually changed the decision to leave military in country to ensure that it happens correct that is correct so it sounds to me like President Trump listened to the generals listen to his advisors had an actual withdrawal plan that was based on a conditioned based agreement but yet the Biden Administration continues to say that all these failures as a result of the Trump Administration you know they didn't have any problem removing things like the remaining Mexico agreement they didn't have any problem remembering other Trump policies but this one thing they were just absolutely hamstrung now as all of you have led many men have you ever been when you take command hell to say that I can't do what I'm supposed to do to make changes for my command when I'm in command I'm in command critical artists Kalinda uh sorry uh Mr Mills uh well of course when you're in command you're in command you've got constraints and limitations on you all the time that you deal with but you know the buck stops with uh with you and that's why it's unfortunate that we don't have anybody in charge of our Wars on the ground because the buck doesn't there there's nobody to hold accountable so you've got the three of us here instead of the senior official who should have been on the ground in charge of this uh evacuation and withdrawal you're exactly right commissary major sir I was taught from a very young age as an NCO that you are responsible for everything your soldiers do or fail to do gentlemen I could not agree more with the testimonies that I've heard so far today and I just want to ask a quick Spitfire question if I may and and this is to you colonel kromrick if we held on to Bagram could we have better protected from the country from the Taliban takeover Bagram would have been my personal choice and I think it would have given us a better opportunity would you agree that if we help Bagram that we could have also have had two simultaneous runways running to help with our near and our evacuation as opposed to taking over just hki and giving up auger well I also would build on that and say it's really about the plant when you decide to make your plan all about the embassy and all about H Kaya you've limited yourself and you've taken away any last ability to be able to enforce the Doha agreement and you threaten everything that we tried to build and all the hope that we put in that country was going to get washed away based on that decision I completely agree with you and I would also note that the bite Administration not only tries to puts on the Trump with regards to the actual withdrawal but when the U.S government takes over hki which is a commercial Airway then all the people who are told November 11th is this magical date that we're going to go on who had booked their flights on August 26th who had booked their flights on August 30th who booked their flights on September 1st through Emirates through cam air through Ariana through the other providers the minute the US government takes control over that airport all those commercial flights got canceled which is single-handedly responsible for the entrapment of the Americans that were actually left behind and my last question which I just have because all of you especially you Colonel who is in charge of Socom other nations including the UK Special Forces was actually out there rescuing their citizens to ensure they got out yet the U.S never did why was U.S soft not allowed to rescue Americans this is an unclassified setting I know that us soft was highly engaged and highly active my personal opinion is the scope of what was being asked was so vast and the time that was allowed for that to happen made it an impossibility for us to be able to thoroughly be able to execute exactly what you're talking about thank you so much again it goes back to the original point which is that not only were these 13 Heroes their death preventable with proper planning with proper military strategy with ensuring that if the metric and conditions-based agreement was not adhered to that we weren't just going to fall apart and withdraw and give everything over to the Taliban after 20 plus years of sacrifices trillions of dollars and thousands of lives this was a planning failure on the Biden Administration and that's who needs to be held accountable here and I can promise you that's who will be held accountable here with that I'd like to recognize my good friend from Texas Mr Moran for five minutes thank you Mr chairman and thank you to each of the witnesses for being here today to share your testimony thank you in particular particular for putting national security policy and Foreign Affairs policy ahead of politics I appreciate that your commitment to improving our future Behavior by evaluating our past decisions is underscored by your presence here and the testimony you've given and I deeply appreciate that Colonel crummer I want to start with you you mentioned that in your testimony that the administration's timing and quote selective intelligence blindness were two of the three fundamental flaws that directly directly threaten the military plan and Mission execution that was from your testimony I'd like to know in your opinion what is one of the most Grievous or egregious examples of quote selective intelligence blindness attributable attributable to the blind Administration during the Afghan withdrawal process there's a number to choose from I think the key piece is when you have over a hundred years of experience between those three four-star generals and they're telling you based on all of this experience that we need to hold off on the withdrawal until the conditions are met and these are the reasons why operationally and based on the entire intelligence Community telling you that this is needs to follow the conditions when that was not followed and the decision was to go to this diplomatic Island in Kabul at that point it was the biggest mistake made by the administration they should have listened to those that had been living it those that had had to endure the losses there and failure to do so was catastrophic and the reason why we put those conditions in such agreements is because if they're not followed then the obligation for our activity then goes away it's a basic principle of law in any contractor conditions proceeding if those are not fulfilled then the other party does not have to fulfill its commitment or obligations and in this case you're saying we just ignored the fact that they didn't fulfill their conditions proceeding is that true that is correct well that is correct you also said as well well known that between May and October is Afghanistan fighting season and the Taliban are at their strongest and the Strategic plans for withdrawal that were offered to the administration was this a well known reality related to the administration absolutely there's 20 years of experience the Afghan fighting season everyone was aware of it but it seems like in their execution of plans they ignored that uh reality would you agree with that absolutely how high would you rank timing as a means for a successful Mission when considering the taliban's season of aggression that was well known for decades it's extremely important some people focus on courses of action but I would always argue that the timing of your operation absolutely matters just as much one more question for you and then and I'll move over the dice but to the best of your knowledge what agreements if any did the U.S make with the Taliban after a Kabul fell I am not privy to that answer does anybody at the diocese have an answer to that question Colonel uh Kalinda do you do you know as well or I do not in Sergeant Major I do not either all right uh Colonel colinda I want to I want to come to you and and thank you for uh your testimony you got about a minute and a half but I want to give you uh just the opportunity to to talk about anything that you've not been able to emphasize today uh that we need to take away as a a lesson from this this botch withdrawal as to to what we need to do differently in the future what lessons can we learn that we haven't discussed today we need to take a yes and approach to these disasters we need to of course look at the immediate disaster of the of the withdrawal and evacuation also what what got us there uh because if if we don't we're going to wind up in another war that ends up in disaster so I I offered you know three of the immediate causes of of the collapse and and these rhyme across Vietnam and Afghanistan I mean the first one is the Afghan government never bothered to gain the buy-in of the of the Afghan people as uh uh Colonel Kremlin krumrick said they they became a predatory kleptocracy um government of Thieves where positions were for sale for exorbitant amounts of money a police chief in a big Province might go for as much as 3 million US Dollars and in exchange for that buying their position they were able to use the position to make make the money back through land theft kidnapping for ransom extorting our Aid in development dollars Etc and all these actions pushed Afghans into the arms of insurgents who were targeting and killing our soldiers um a second uh you know a second major reason is uh that is as Colonel krummridge said the the Taliban were much more Innovative we got very complacent over 20 years uh believing you know we in the Afghan government believing that we could do the same thing over and over again and expect similar results but when a Taliban are innovating militarily politically diplomatically eventually by the summer 2021 they had the upper hand and sadly many Afghans saw the Taliban as the lesser of two evils uh and third and finally is we have got to create a a some sort of doctrine that helps us build developing World militaries much more effectively we can't afford to make them in our own image and likeness it doesn't work there are other models that would have made the Afghan military more sustainable able to able to stand on its own and not simply collapse like a house of cards that's our fault uh and we should fix that thank you gentlemen Mr chairman I yield back thank you so much and myself and the ranking member are just agreeing uh on the fact that you're right we can't continue to model everything as if it's the U.S model and then expect that to to go forward so thank you for those that was a great uh layout in your right military Doctrine drives it at this time I'd like to recognize the gentleman from Georgia for five minutes Mr McCormick thank you Mr chair and thank you for the witnesses thank you for your service as I listen to the not just the testimony but the people asking the questions a lot of us have served overseas a lot of us have a lot of joint service all right right around here I'm saying I'm looking at Air Force Navy Marine Army literally right in a row uh people are your brothers in arms asking you questions understanding that that uh you guys were there and you did that and we appreciate your service and appreciate your testimony today um a lot of us when we talk about the withdrawal for example uh when I I remember when the withdrawal was happening it's probably one of the worst adult experiences I've had in my life that may sound over dramatic you know I wasn't even there but but yet anybody who served and understands the people we've lost the friends we've visited the grave sites the time we spent away from our family the months and years even that we spent away from our families all of us the traumatic brain injuries the limbs lost 2 461 deaths trillions of dollars 20 years of investment to give it back to the people who now are harboring I think what 27 bases that are are training terrorists now that hurts and and it I'm not over yet and I don't think any of us are and so when I hear people talk about well we just need to learn lessons you're right we do need to learn lessons and that's what this is about um you've already talked Colonel I really appreciate chroma uh you're talking about some of the different things that we've made mistakes on
