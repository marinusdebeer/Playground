once in June in these meetings I required about the offense of the Taliban had launched in May and the increasing ground they controlled I asked if Neo was going to be held in Bagram due to the taliban's rapid advance that indicated an assault on Kabul the team acknowledged the ground that the Taliban had gained but offered little insight as the to the decision-making process at the embassy honor about June 14th we were given the order to close Bagram by July 4th well short of the originally planned date of September 11th hkaya would remain open and provide a quick reaction force to the Embassy located approximately four driving miles away this was to be an enduring mission all talks of conducting a Neo were ceased it is my understanding that those in the embassy believe that the Taliban would not advance to take a bull and a Neo was unnecessary I exited it as one of the final conventional forces in Bagram on 2 July 2021. my thoughts stayed with the forces that would stay on the ground as the Taliban controlled about 50 percent of Afghanistan on the day I Departed one single U.S infantry company Charlie Company 431 infantry 10th Mountain division led by Captain Swayze Brown and first sergeant Andrew Kelly protected H Kaya for approximately six weeks before things began to unravel in mid-august an area once protected by hundreds of soldiers and contractors was now protected by a hundred and thirteen American soldiers and two companies of our Turkish partner forces approximately 430 other U.S service members and Logistics maintenance air defense and service roles also occupied hkaya this was the only Force left in Afghanistan I will offer this final bit of opinion the mission asked of this company and the subsequent Marines soldiers Airmen Sailors and Coalition forces called to reinforce the smallest security contingent was monumental the military executed this Mission and the closure of Afghanistan with honor integrity and dignity there's no force in the world that have executed such a chaotic and difficult Mission better than our U.S and Coalition forces did under the diarist of circumstances they were asked to control absolute panic and Anarchy they somehow did it I think every single one of them for our sacrifice to our great nation thank you for allowing me to speak here today thank you command sergeant major we're now going to move to questions I'm going to be Begin by recognizing chairman of the full committee chairman McCall for five minutes chairman let me first again acknowledge as a gold star families here and I want to thank the three Witnesses for your moral courage and Clarity in your testimony here today um you know there's an old adage if you plan if you fail to plan you're planning to fail Benjamin Franklin first chairman of this committee Continental Congress he was right there was no plan if you fail to plan you plan to fail we have uncovered that there was a request that came from the state department to the defense department for an evacuation plan however that came on August 17th two days after the fall of Afghanistan the fall of Kabul four days after our Embassy was evacuated and yet the President says we're planned for all contingencies I think Colonel krummick you eloquently talked about how he recklessly disregarded his own National Security Council his own generals and the intelligence community that we were being briefed at the same time well we saw this Rosy narrative by state and that this dire Warning by the rest the dod in the intelligence community and the result was this complete debacle and failure so Colonel chronic my first question is is to you was there a plan have did you ever see an evacuation plan thank you for the question uh chairman the way the process works for planning is we'll get an initial guidance that we need to come up with courses of action so centcom u.s4a built a number of courses of action that were very different they they were very unique in each um you know characteristics of each one it could be timeline it could be conditions troop levels and then the senior military members could you pull that microphone a little bit closer thank you thank you so the senior commanders then will pick one and give them a recommendation and explain why that is now feeding into this is also the intelligence community so this is part operations part intelligence and they'll lay out hey this is the plan we think we should take and in this case General milley General Miller General McKenzie all recommended we should not do the withdrawal until conditions are met because violence had risen in Afghanistan and their concern was the timing is wrong this isn't going to give our um our allies a chance to be able to react accordingly to the Taliban offensive so in the two minutes I I just want to drill this down because sure yeah there was a recommendation and you talked about the failure to meet the Doha agreement but the president disregarded that ignored that he disregarded the advice of his his DOD and IC and National Security Council was there ever an evacuation plan did you see I know there's discussions did you ever see an evacuation plan I did not the discussions were going on at this high level the problem was those that would need to actually plan and rehearse it were extremely busy I think sergeant major captured it eloquently of how busy and how few service members we had on the ground they were not in a position to be able to plan and rehearse now we've issued several subpoena I have not seen an evacuation plan if they had it I think they would have produced it to this committee and this led to the chaos who was in charge you know we heard Sergeant Tyler Vargas Andrew testify that he had the suicide bomber in his sights but they didn't know what the rules of engagement were for God's sakes I mean there's no plan there is there are you know Rules of Engagement are confusing at best they don't know what they are did you know what the rules of engagement were I was not in the ground so I can't speak to the specific Rules of Engagement I know the military had a clear leadership position of who was in charge on the ground what was lacking from my perspective was the Department of State leadership on the ground when I asked who was in charge you know if if you have an evacuation plan state takes over the evacuation correct prior to that the dod is in charge but nobody knows he was really in charge because there's no plan in place and guess what the talbian takes over my last question The Rules of Engagement are you know confusing at best you have mentioned a defensive strike would be a rule of Engagement if you saw a description of the suicide bomber along with your sniper team who confirmed this is the suicide bomber were the Rules of Engagement provide that you could take out the threat as a defensive strike if I saw the suicide bomber and I saw the threat I would absolutely kill that suicide bomber and yet when he contacted his commanding officer who we're going to interview he says I don't have that Authority and they ask who does have that Authority he goes I don't know I'll have to get back to you and then the interim time guess what the bomb goes off killing 13 service men and women 160 Afghans injury 45 additionals U.S servicemen and women massive because one man says you don't have permission to engage we're going to follow up on that chain but I think it all results because there's confusion on the ground nobody knows what the plan and nobody knows who is in charge yes sir so if I could just build on that I think the point that you're making that there's nobody in charge is exactly right there's nobody functionally in charge of our Wars on the ground in theater so what happens if I could just draw a quick um quick picture is we deploy to combat zones in bureaucratic silos so you've got the you've got the president and then National Security Council beneath them of course and then you've got these different bureaucratic silos so it could be uh DOD state Aid uh the IC with their different silos and there's nobody in charge of this group on the ground and had there been somebody in charge of this group on the ground then what you would have seen is a plan that not only synchronized the military withdrawal but also the evacuation so until we get this problem fixed we actually have somebody in charge on the ground of our Wars we're going to continue to have high risk of these kind of disasters I agree and by law they're required to come up with a plan and they did not and that's the point the Chairman's made over and over and I thank you for indulging me thank you chairman thank you for your responses ranking member crows now recognized for five minutes thank you chairman and thank you all for your your testimony and opening I just wanted to provide a little bit of context here and I'm going to ask a few quick questions starting with both the colonel Chrome rich and colonel kolinda from 2016 to 2021 are you aware that the Taliban had increased its control of territory every year for those consecutive five years colonel carmich yes Colonel Kalinda yes absolutely are you aware of any indications in that five-year period that the Taliban was in internally involved in discussions that indicated that they would be willing to enter into a peace agreement with the government of Afghanistan or that they believed that continued combat operations was the key to success either one of you their petitioning their participation in the Doha agreement I'm not talking about the participation I'm talking about intelligence indicating whether or not the Taliban really believed that that that that that the path the success for them was a negotiated peace agreement or whether they were going to continue to press combat operations I did I don't have visibility on the specific intelligence that would lead to their thinking okay uh Mr ranking member I can provide some insight on that yeah uh in 2017 and 2018 I was in a in my personal capacity I was outside of government at that point I was involved in some track two discussions with the Taliban uh leaders their version of diplomats who were in Doha and um and in real life synced here because I have a bunch of other questions to just answer the question yeah you can when when the United States removed the timeline the Taliban at least their Diplomat said we want to start talks because we don't want our country to use their words to turn into another Syria okay so who who started those talks and who uh what president agreed to the Doha agreement those talks started in 2018 I believe under President Trump okay and after that agreement was executed did the Taliban largely stop attacking U.S soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan yes and then um uh after the Taliban stopped attacking soldiers in the ground in Afghanistan U.S soldiers did that allow us to then reduce troop numbers I'll answer that too yeah there were seven provisions for the question after the Taliban stopped offensive operations against U.S military in Afghanistan then did that allow us to reduce troop numbers it did okay and then when did that true production start a specific date rough roughly speaking I know that we had started reducing uh troop numbers uh after the Doha agreement regardless the Taliban were not meeting the conditions required of them for us to be doing those withdrawals and at a certain point there was discussion which we started in 2020 correct correct largely drastically reducing troop numbers in 2020. we did and we were moving are you okay next question are you aware of a provision that me Mr Waltz and Miss Cheney passed in the 2020 ndaa cycle that would restrict the ability of the Trump Administration to reduce troop levels below 2000 unless certain conditions and certain planning and reports were made to Congress are you aware of that provision I'm not but I'm glad you did okay well this passed it became law are you aware that President Trump uh in early January weeks before the transition of the presidency actually waived that provision so that he could reduce numbers below 2000. I know there is a discussion to bring the troops below 2000 and I know General milley and Senior military commanders advised him not to do it and they rescinded that order so he did it correct he did then it was rescinded there were numbers drop below 2000 due to a presidential waiver in January 2021 correct or or if you're not aware then just say you're not I would I would have well that is true [Music] um if if we had not withdrawn by the end of August of 2021 is it uh I want to hear from each of you very briefly is it your belief that the Taliban would have resumed combat operations against U.S soldiers U.S troops in the ground colonel kurmerich I believe I believe if we had not pulled out by that date that they would have had a hard time once the winter started to be able to actually execute that which would have given the Afghan government the time and space to get their feet on your testimony your testimony is that you believe the Taliban would not have resumed combat operations against the United States uh in in the fall of 2021. as long as there was negotiations going at the Taliban where we were telegraphing what our timeline would be I believe that they would have respected it it was the only thing they did out of the entire Doha agreement Colonel Kalinda I think if we did not talk with them and coordinate a new date and it looked like we were violating our end of the agreement then I believe the Taliban would have resumed attacks Sergeant Major Smith sir respectfully I don't have enough information and I'm not in a position to give my opinion on this matter and and had they resumed attacks which most of the intelligence shows they would have would we have been able to adequately defend ourselves with the roughly 1 000 troops we had or would we had to have added troops on the ground what we have had to have surged into Afghanistan again colonel kumrich my recommendation would have been to add all the force protection required so we would have had to have added troops right I wouldn't call it a surge Colonel Kalinda uh I I agree Mr ranking member that we would most likely have had to add troops in order to uh protect ourselves Sergeant mayor Smith sir again I do not have enough information to speak educated my point here is there was a really really hard decision that had to be made that uh President Biden made choosing from extremely difficult Alternatives that would have potentially caused more conflict and more combat operations through 2021 into the present uh thank you for the additional time I yield back absolutely thank you ranking member crowd you consider it a nonsensical question to ask about if something would resume that never ceased right up to the bombing of the Abbey gate but I now recognize uh Miss stefanik for five minutes thank you chairman Mast and chairman McCall for the opportunity to wave on this hearing on this committee today I want to start by thanking our Witnesses for their service sacrifice and your testimony today Command Sergeant Major Smith I'm especially grateful that you took on this tremendous responsibility of testifying as I have the distinct honor of representing Fort Drum home of the 10th Mountain division the most deployed division in the U.S army since 9 11. and I want to make sure in today's hearing that we remember to highlight that although Joe Biden and the Biden Administration made Reckless decisions that resulted in the avoidable tragic deaths of our service members it is important to recognize so many men and women in uniform who served valiantly and bravely in the spring of 2021 Command Sergeant Major Smith you met with the U.S embassy site survey team and they told you they were considering Bagram and H Kaya as two potential evacuation operation sites why did you advise the site survey team against using H Kaya and Warrior concerns taken into consideration ma'am I appreciate you let me speak um as far as the site survey team taken my advice into consideration I I don't know the private conversations they had after they left I I cannot speak on that uh from from my standpoint um Bagram had a much more tactical advantage to conducting Neo out of it was much easier to defend uh the uh the entry control points were very much defended in depth it would have been very easy to to create a filtering process within those entry control points to filter out those that needed to be evacuated and those who didn't it was just a much more tactically advantageous location and meanwhile the Taliban was rapidly advancing on Kabul and every day it became clear that an evacuation would likely be necessary and the recently released State Department after action review shows that the Biden Administration understood that the closure of Bagram meant that the only place this evacuation would be conducted would be H Kaya and we know there were 113 soldiers from Charlie Company 431 of the 10th Mountain division assigned to protect H Kaya as the Taliban was rapidly approaching from your extensive experience in Afghanistan was a company size element adequate to perform the mission the 10th mountain soldiers were assigned ma'am if I was in command I would have had at least a battalion there a battalion that is a big difference from a company this disastrous decision leading up to the Afghanistan withdrawal forced Charlie Company 431 into a mission that was nearly impossible to execute and yet for over a month the brave Soldiers of the 10th Mountain division defended H Kaya as Afghanistan was engulfed in chaos this hearing is important to bring transparency and shed light and ultimately answers to those families particularly our gold starred families of whom I know some are here today we can never thank them enough for their sacrifice thank you for your service and I yield back the balance chairman mast thank you Mr stefanik chair now yields five minutes to Mr Kim thank you Mr chair thank you to the three of you to come on out here Colonel comerich I want to start with you you know we talked a lot about the Doha agreement you were talking about how the you know the seven conditions you know six were not met but I want to just kind of start by taking a step back uh did you agree with the approach of of starting those negotiations with the Taliban to start with it was a it was there was a lot of controversy about that you know should we be engaged in negotiations directly unilaterally with the Taliban without the government of Afghanistan at the table what were your thoughts about that I think uh the it's clear that when you do 20 years of war you have to find an end it starts with open conversations and it starts with having those open channels of communication with the Taliban I think that that was an important step I think it was something that needed to begin so that we could then expand it over time to bring in all the parties that were relevant to the situation so you supported the idea of starting with the Taliban without the government of Afghanistan in there and then trying to see if you can bring in the other parties in my written statement I was clear I'm a realist I know that this has to end at some point it's really when you control the how and the when you have to be very methodical and deliberate about it if that is an open Avenue to begin the process absolutely was it a good deal was a Doha agreement a good deal on paper yeah sure but the Doha agreement is worthless if you can't get both parties to do what is required we operated in good faith to our detriment more importantly the detriment of the Afghan people when you were talking about the challenges in 2021 you were talking about how they were just tactical if I remember correctly you were saying that tactically you know trying to organize a withdrawal in the spring and the summer is just not a good tactical effort is that correct that's correct would you then extend that to the timeline set out in the Doha agreement the Doha agreement was uh agreed to in February 14 months later if conditions were met that there would be withdrawal so that would bring it to May 2021 was it was that sort of a a flaw then in the document to start with no I think if we got to May of 21 and the conditions were met which is critical then the stage would have been set did you did you were responsible withdrawal you you've talked very deeply about your distrust of the of the Taliban did you have a belief that that those conditions actually could have been met all seven conditions realistically we wouldn't get into this conversation if we didn't believe that there was a chance the problem and I think Colonel Glenda hit it too it's so you thought realistically there was a chance that the Taliban would agree to all seven conditions we wouldn't have put him out there if they hadn't I mean you had to you've got to take a leap of trust to say look we're going to give you the opportunity to do it the conditions based portion even if you take a leap of trust I mean you know have some sense of contingency and setting that kind of timetable up front of of May uh look I mean you talked about how there there haven't been these conditions met you know I agree with you there were not the conditions met and you and if I agree if I heard you correctly you said we should not have started troop withdrawals and reductions unless the conditions were met is that correct that's correct yeah so I just want to just make sure that so then the withdrawals that happened you know on October 7th the reductions to less than 5 000 Trump's saying we should try to have the troops home by Christmas so you would disagree with those decisions as well I think there was prudent steps taken when we saw the conditions weren't being met when we began our troop withdrawals and then we saw that there was no intention of the Taliban to actually follow these at that point you know General milley and other senior leaders talk to the president and they halted the withdrawal at that point to make sure that we were making sure that the conditions were driving the decisions yeah Colonel calendar I want to bring you in on this I mean I I hear what I'm just trying to tease out here is uh is that and I think you kind of really hit the nail on the head just these were systemic problems across the board over 20 years for administrations two presidents of either party I mean we recognize there are problems and and mistakes that were made uh leading up to the withdrawal but also you know going backwards would you agree with that kind of statement there in February 14th of 2018 the Taliban issued an open letter to the American people saying they wanted talks and I agree with my my colleague that we've got an obligation fighting a just War to explore those opportunities now you negotiate to secure your interest not to give them away and the dilha agreement seemed to trade make an agreement trading no U.S troops for Promises of no terrorism and then there was no accountability so there's no single person who was able to below the president United States who was able to say the Taliban or material breach we are stopping to withdrawal and we are resuming um you know military operations against them nobody had that Authority and again it's this it's this Silo problem and and a related problem is that um the state department does not have any body of expert knowledge on how to conduct wartime negotiations in which the United States is an active participant this is a major shortfall in the state Department's body of knowledge it's a major shortfall in our national security thinking and one of the Common Sense reforms that that we can make to prevent something like this from happening again Grant thank you I yield back thank you Mr Kim I find it an Amazing Leap to think that President Trump Obama or bush are responsible for what happened in the literal withdrawal of Afghanistan but everybody is entitled to their opinions I now yield to Mr Waltz for five minutes thank you Mr chair and yeah I think we we hear this from the other side of the aisle uh quite a lot well we have to put this all into context and there were a lot of mistakes made in the 20 years of war and and frankly I think that's a sad deflection from the mistakes that were made the debacle that this withdrawal uh was I could fill this room with Think Tank reports and studies some of which you authored uh Mr Kalinda and that I participated in in the Pentagon back under the Bush Administration which by the way talks began in the Bush Administration they continued in the Obama Administration all to to varying degrees uh and then we hear about as we're hearing from the other side about well it was really about Doha and heck we even just saw that in President Biden's after action review but the end of the day and this is the fact that people just can't get over is President Trump's National Security team went into him and said that Taliban are not living up to it and he did not withdraw they didn't live up to their end of the bargain and therefore we stopped and then we hear well we the administration the bite Administration didn't have any choice they had no problem with the getting back into the Paris Accord they had no problem reversing course on Iran they had no problem reversing course On the Border heck they even canceled an entire Pipeline on day one but yet we're supposed to be you know we're supposed to believe that they had no choice when it came to Afghanistan it's a bunch of crap it's a garbage argument and I think deep down my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know it in in their hearts so let's let's just stick to the fact a hand of this withdrawal and how it was handled Colonel kromrick your senior staff officer in in Central Command and you're testifying that President Biden ignored the military of advice of three four-star generals General Miller General McKenzie and general milley correct that is correct and it's probably it's safe to to articulate that our soldiers their loved ones were asked to do two conflicting missions to completely get everything out as fast as possible in a full withdrawal but yet also facilitate an evacuation is that accurate correct that is correct sergeant major you're testifying that your best military advice on using Bagram instead of H Kaya was also ignored is that correct that's not the way it happened sir we did not do it out of Bagram and on Bagram and this is critical to the family sitting behind you was the prison holding seven thousand seven thousand of the most hardened terrorists including the suicide bomber that killed their loved ones at Abbey gate correct that is correct were you aware of any contingency planning the Afghans regarding it but they needed the base for power for life support for supplies were you aware of any contingency planning as the Taliban are closing in on Kabul to deal with those prisoners should that prison fall or should they be released were you aware of any contingency planning either anyone I was not sir hey finally I'll just ask you were you aware of any contingency planning to deal with our sivs key Afghans like Ministry officials journalists women activists people that the Taliban would obviously had targeted for 20 years and would continue were you aware or including heck our own U.S citizens any contingency planning as part of this rapid withdrawal to get those folks out should our assumptions that the Afghan government could hold in the military uh in the Afghan military would hold would fail any contingency planning along those lines no and it became very painfully obvious under extreme duress how big of a gap that that was so this was an utter lack of planning that their loved ones paid the ultimate price for and that our Afghan allies right now today are being hunted down as we speak are still paying the price for and future American soldiers have to go up and to go back and clean up this mess as we've had to do in Iraq from the Obama Administration decisions I mean there's a direct causality there in your opinion thank you and what would happen to a leader in the military who ignored intelligence and failed to plan in this case till the day before resulting in troops killed what would happen they would get court-martialed how does it make you feel that not a single official has resigned been relieved been court-martialed even laterally transferred heck how does that make you feel terrible and I would like wanting to take responsibility you know when JFK I had the Bay of Pigs he came out and said the buck stops with me you know I am not only they're not taking responsibility president of the United States saying it's outstanding success so it should at least secretary blinken with State Department in charge of this operation in your opinion at least resign he's not going to be fired by the President should he at least resign I can't speak of what he should do but I would say that senior leaders definitely need to be held accountable in that organization well they're not under this Administration uh Colonel but this committee will not let this go thank you Mr chairman for your Indulgence both uh both uh both chairman and to to our families we will not let this go as long as I sit in this seat we will drive accountability for you and for your loved ones thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Waltz we now yield five minutes to miss Titus thank you Mr chairman and thank the witnesses and I too honor the gold star families who are here and appreciate them sitting through and having to relive some of this I would point out that uh you've been mentioned about the 7 000 prisoners released part of the Doha agreement was to release 5 000 of those prisoners isn't that right uh colonel krumich I would have to go back and look at the numbers but that was that was part of the Doha agreement if conditions were met and people were acting in good faith that there would be steps taken now as I understand it you were the chief of staff at Special Operations Command Central starting what back in 2019. I wasn't so while you were there uh wow you said over and over and over and over we've heard this there was no plan no plan no plan did you see any planning during the time you were there starting in 2019 leading up to Doha but to be clear us-4a had plans like on the military side and this is something I want to make sure is really clear the military has military plans and they executed them with under great duress and they executed very well both the acting of the withdrawal which was key I mean they did that in an incredible timeline and it's a testament to the planning and the execution given the nature of the plan and the actual Neo itself to get 120 000 people I appreciate that I know how well our military performed and how many people were removed but why then do you keep saying there's no plan no plan no plan no I don't think I said that I said that I said that there was a man up here keep saying it now the plan that we put forth as the military recommended course of action was not chosen and a separate course of action was selected by the administration which focused on the Diplomatic footprint going back to my earlier testimony there was three goals the first was I've got the testimony I can read it uh you know talk about diplomatic Solutions this is a committee that looks at foreign affairs not a military that's uh that's a different committee so I'd like to get back to some of the diplomacy we've heard a lot about how the women and children left in Afghanistan or women and girls are being so mistreated isn't it true that during the negotiations where the Doha plant there were no women at the table no women in the room would that have made a difference in some of the decisions that were made uh doctor could you come on that Dr Kalinda I wasn't in the room at Doha I know on the certainly on the Taliban side there are no women present I think on the American side uh maybe there were um so that's always part of the about as part of the Afghan government as Mr Kim was saying that they weren't in the room either were they no they were not in the room okay okay all right well another thing is it would reform that we this we've got to look at fixing this we've got to look at how to make it better not just keep going over and over and over again about how terrible it was we acknowledged that we there were mistakes made that our hearts go out to those families but let's try to prevent it from happening again maybe one of the reforms that we could make and talk about is expanding that Afghan uh adjustment I think an Afghan agreement act where we look at the number of visas that are provided to get families out can we expand that would that make a difference would that be helpful I was talking with congresswoman I was speaking with one of my former interpreters yesterday who I helped get a special immigrant visa and his family is still in Afghanistan his parents he's got siblings still in Afghanistan under threat and it would be it would be wonderful if immediate family members of our SIV holders could qualify as well well let's do something that that something come from this other than just a rehashing I think that's something that the committee uh should look at you also mentioned that in your written testimony some of the solutions that we systemic Solutions the problem with the silos nobody on the ground would you just lay out for us some of those other Solutions so we can read it but let's put it on the record uh sure congresswoman uh the the first one I mentioned is we need a basic National Security Doctrine at the military called a Doctrine or set of terms and Concepts so we're using across agencies we're using the same terms to mean the same things um I was in the White House situation room listening to people use the word defeat reconciliation um other terms to mean completely different things and that impeded communication undermined our ability to coordinate uh the terms evacuation and withdrawal mean different things to different people if we were speaking the same language within the administ within any Administration across agencies then we would have a much greater chance of improving communication and coordination fewer things falling through the cracks second or related to that is we need to we need to have a Doctrine about war termination the military doesn't have one the state department doesn't have one state Department's got no expert body of knowledge on how to conduct wartime negotiations in which the United States is the active participant and it has not worked out well every single time so that expert body of knowledge is not difficult to create and something that you know could be could be done fairly uh rapidly the the next reform is to actually put somebody in charge on the ground of our Wars so instead of right now all the silos deploying by Silo so the lowest ranking person that anybody on the ground reports to the senior leaders on the ground report too the lowest ranking person they were all report to is the president of the United States I mean you can't run a business that way you certainly can't run a war that way so we need a a congressional equivalent of like a Goldwater Nichols Act for the interagency which gives the president the capability to appoint a senior civilian or military official to um to be in charge of our of our all U.S efforts on the ground and everybody reporting to uh you know to to that individual and that person is then held accountable by the president for achieving U.S aims and can also appear before Congress for proper oversight and accountability it would we're missing that today in this in this hearing there's one no one person Congress can point to and say talk to us about this disastrous evacuation um and then the the final point is we need a much better Doctrine for how we build developing military institutions the way we built the Afghan military was in our own image and likeness because that's what we knew but there are other models for militaries and if we had a greater menu of options and you know what sort of considerations would make one option more advantageous than another we could have built an Afghan military that was much more self-reliant much less dependent upon us and quite frankly I mean I'm a consultant I work with clients and I've got an ethical obligation to make sure that when we part ways which we will always do that my clients are better off and they're able to sort in New Heights on their own um what we did creating such a dependent military was um was uh malpractice thank you very much thank you Mr chairman absolutely Miss Titus and I would think just personally that if the president does a delegate delegate an authority then he has the authority in the individuals report to the president directly should he not delegate somebody in that I now yield five minutes to Mr Isa oh thank you Mr chairman and uh I'll just briefly say the first time I was in Afghanistan was shortly after uh we went in in 01 and I observed that it was a I observed
