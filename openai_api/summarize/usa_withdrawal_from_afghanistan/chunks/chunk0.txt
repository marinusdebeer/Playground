some that are with us in the audience today I want to begin by recognizing Christy shamblin if you wouldn't mind standing we'd love for everybody to see a mother-in-law of Sergeant Nicole G lost at the Abbey gate Alicia Lopez the mother of Corporal Hunter Lopez killed in action at the Abbey gate Coral racino and Alan Doolittle parents of Corporal Humberto Sanchez also killed in action at the Abbey gate thank you for joining us today thank you for raising Patriots and I'm sorry for your loss I'm now going to recognize myself for an opening statement I'm not going to begin by belaboring any points the president's withdrawal was a complete and utter catastrophe the images of people hanging off of planes and desperate parents handing their babies over the airport walls to soldiers are seared into our country's Collective conscience yesterday every member of this Committee in this room Republican and Democrat voted to require the state department to come up with a plan for reimbursing the numerous outside groups who had to get involved to rescue Americans from Afghanistan I can guarantee that private citizens flying seven thousand miles across the world to rescue Americans and those that worked alongside America for 20 years was not a product of the state Department's good planning and order that was a product of chaos and a failure to plan and we have witnesses here today that will be able to give specific pictures of what was happening on the ground that will be clearer and more accurate than any news report that I've seen and frankly I believe that's because the White House and its mouthpieces were lying to the American people as they were narrating what was taking place during the withdrawal of Afghanistan I have no doubt that your eyewitness testimonies will demonstrate a clear failure to predict or plan for the worst case scenarios as we do when we plan military operations I'm grateful to each of you for appearing here today command sergeant major Jake Smith specifically is here in his personal capacity he is an active duty service member and so I would ask members of the committee to refrain from engaging him in political questions the purpose of today's hearing is to examine the failure to plan and the major repercussions that it had on diplomatic efforts and National Security this Administration said time and time again that Afghanistan was not a war that could be won militarily that's the administration's words it could only be one diplomatically if this could only be won diplomatically then there is no other conclusion then the withdrawal was a complete and total loss because that is when we lost all diplomatic options the literal failure to plan was completely completely erased the potential for on-the-ground diplomacy and created a black eye for the United States standing abroad and National Security at home I'm going to say this I wrote black guy in my comments when I wrote this this isn't a black guy it black guy does not come close to constituting what took place what it is for America with the draw withdraw of Afghanistan I don't I don't know the appropriate word to say what exactly that is but it's black eye is not the right one in the words of the administration spokesperson Jennifer saki the mouthpiece the president asked for a review from his National Security team he asked them not to sugarcoat it and he was provided with a clear-eyed assessment about the best path forward these are the words of Jennifer sake she said that the president was the ultimate decision maker he was the decision maker who chose September 11th as the initial drawdown date he was the decision maker who pulled the people with the guns out before the people without the guns the decision maker who collapsed the operations at age to H Kaya airport it was President Joe Biden the ultimate decision maker he decided to to make the decisions and none of those decisions in that process of the withdrawal they weren't made in the Doha agreement that's not when they were made they were made by the ultimate decision maker Joe Biden Americans asked after the withdrawal how could the intelligence have gotten it so wrong but I find it to be clearer each and every day that the intelligence didn't get it as wrong as Americans thought it was the ultimate decision maker that was refusing to listen to the Intelligence being given again in the words of the White House spokesperson Jennifer sake the president believes there is not a military solution this will require a diplomatic solution she said that the president was clear from the beginning that we anticipated and planned to have a diplomatic presence on the ground moving forward why then did we see a repeat of Saigon with diplomatic Personnel being evacuated off of the roof of an embassy though that is exactly what President Biden said would never happen it's because of a failure to plan for Murphy a failure to plan for a situation when things don't go exactly perfect exactly as you plan the basic military a failure to plan meant that the security of diplomatic Personnel could not be guaranteed and as a result there's no diplomatic presence on the ground today again in the words of the administration spokesperson Jennifer saki the United States will retain significant assets in the region as the president talked about Over the Horizon capabilities to counter the potential re-emergence of the terrorist threat that's garbage any Over the Horizon capabilities that we had to deal with terrorist threats were wiped out almost immediately and it has only gotten worse from the onset of the withdrawn the decision to abandon Bagram Airfield our capabilities were diminished in our security deteriorated The Abbey gate bomber was a member of Isis K who had just been released from the Bagram prison now in the two years since Afghanistan has essentially become a Club Med for terrorists Isis is using it as a training ground though fighting with the Taliban the Taliban is sending welfare payments to Al-Qaeda Fighters there are no Over the Horizon capabilities to deal with that it's the opposite our adversaries are literally gaining a foothold there just three months ago leaders from Iran Russia China they met Uzbekistan to discuss what they called quote Regional Solutions rather than Western interference in Afghanistan our Witnesses here today will be able to speak to the situation on the ground and that the failure to plan wiped out any possibility of what the administration said had to be the victory that was diplomatic efforts as a direct result of in my opinion a failure to plan not bad luck bad planning America Mourns 13 of its sons and daughters we have families sitting in our audience who mourn the loss of their sons and daughters I've had numerous conversations with the families and what I've extracted from those conversations is there's nothing that can bring back anybody's children my colleague we've lost friends you all have lost friends there's nothing that can bring back anybody that we've lost we look for Solace and how we don't repeat the mistakes of the past that's to be frank that's what I've heard from the families how do we make sure that something like this never happens again so we're trying to learn so that we don't repeat those past mistakes but from where I see it those that made the mistakes are still in the exact same positions today or they've advanced in the positions that they hold and they are now trying to rewrite history in order to Tout The withdraw of Afghanistan as a success and what that tells me is that as of right now they haven't learned a thing I'm now going to recognize my colleague ranking member Crow the gentleman from Colorado for any opening statement that you may have thank you chairman mast let me Begin by um joining the chairman in recognizing the gold star families Ms shamblin Ms Lopez Ms Racino Mr Doolittle our our country owes you a debt of gratitude that frankly we will never be able to repay your families have made the greatest sacrifice that any family can make for this nation and we owe you a debt of gratitude that even though we can't repay we must attempt to do so by conducting ourselves in a in a way that is worthy of the sacrifice of your children and that requires honesty requires Candor it requires giving answers and that's what I will endeavor to do with my colleagues here in a non-partisan way because that's what you deserve um also I want to recognize Command Sergeant Major Smith in the category of it's a very very small world I was a commander sergeant major Smith's platoon leader in the second ranger battalion uh where uh we did multiple Afghanistan rotations during that time so Command Sergeant mayor Smith it's it's really great to see you all the way um I I do want to say I mean this is an incredibly emotionally a Charged issue as it should be because the consequences were so high and so catastrophic for so many people but to do this right and you know I'm not reading off of prescription remarks here I'm just kind of speaking from the heart frankly um to do this right in my view requires uh honesty and and Candor as I mentioned earlier uh and you know my critiques of the withdrawal my criticism of the withdrawal are lengthy and actually well documented it was I was very clear uh in uh 2021 that I did not think it went the way it should have been that there were a lot of missteps there were a lot of problems and we do owe it to uh the Fallen we do owe it to America we owe to the taxpayers that spent tens of billions of dollars uh the over 3 000 people that gave their lives in Afghanistan all of them to actually have an honest accounting of that but I also want to make it clear that my goal here is that the story of Afghanistan is not the story just of August of 2021. that's not the whole story right and that's not to to Pivot away from having an honest assessment of that month in that withdrawal because we have to have that and the American people deserve that but we have to broaden the aperture right this was a 20-year War this was America's longest war right multiple generations of Americans fought in this war and sacrificed and gave for it four presidencies were responsible for this war ten congresses were responsible for this war and frankly honestly before August of 2021 you asked most members of Congress to find Afghanistan on a map and they couldn't right and there's awful lot of Monday morning quarterbacking now and people sitting back and saying that they they knew what should have happened this is what should have happened and you know having all sorts of opinions where for years nobody even paid attention to it which I know frustrated us right to no end all my fellow Veterans as we as we talked and worked on this and said this was moving in a bad direction for a long time and nobody was listening and paying attention to it so that's the history in the context and I hope that we can have a hearing today that addresses elements of the withdrawal that learns important lessons to make sure that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past but that we also provide context we also understand that there were there's a long history here in in August 2021 just didn't happen on its own that there are years in a lot of things that led us to that moment that are a part of this story here that we have to have an honest accounting of so that's my goal and I look forward to the conversation today I yield back thank you Mr Crowe and I'm pleased to have the chairman of the full committee chairman McCall with us and I recognize you for as much time as you may consume for an opening statement thank you Mr chairman for that generous recognition I want to thank both of you for your service in the Afghanistan war Mr chairman ranking member um I remember traveling as a member spending days and you're spending years and we got a little snapshot of what was going on but you were on the ground fighting and Mr chairman you know your loss of Limbs of sacrifice the that both of you made but Mr chairman particularly you does not go unnoticed by this committee or me as a chairman of the full committee and I just want to thank you for your service and I want to thank the gold star families it's good to see you again we had a very nice visit last week you know Christy shamlin the mother in law of Sergeant Nicole G Alicia Lopez mother of Corporal Hunter Lopez I used by the way Hunter's pen to sign my subpoena for the after action report from the state department that is still yet to be complied with and Alan Doolittle and coral brazino the parents of Corporal Sanchez thank you and the witnesses for your moral courage to come here today to speak the truth about what happened and to the ranking member I agree there are many mistakes made in the 20 years but the ultimate mistake ended 20 years of blood and treasure with now the towel being in charge raising their flag over our Embassy taking seven billion dollars of our weapons leaving the women behind under Sharia law now where they can't even go outside I was with the ambassador of Afghanistan Roy Romani had dinner with her last night and we talked about what happened what how it was stabilized and then it went into chaos because one man made the decision and that is the commander-in-chief and the buck stops here as Harry Truman would say so let's own it and take responsibility and not try to kick it down or go back in time and say it was someone else's fault true leaders own mistakes and this was a mistake of epic proportions this unconditional I withdrawal I call it an unconditional surrender to the Taliban who now have taken over Afghanistan and what's really sad especially when we examine the Abbey gate and we heard from sergeant Tyler Andrew Vargas about the fact that it could have been prevented in many cases that is the hardest thing I know for the families to accept and I was there we were there for the briefings from state from DOD and the IC and for months President Biden ignored warnings from his own generals and his own intelligence community and bipartisan members of Congress about what was happening on the ground as the narrative didn't fit what was happening on the ground coming out of the White House as the chairman so eloquently went through whether it was his spokespersons to him himself about what was happening it was like a blind eye the result of this committee's oversight so far we did get access to The Descent cable from the employees at the embassy they were telling the story about what was happening they were the ones who said Mr President it's going to happen fast they predict by September 1st they got pretty close and they said we're not prepared and you need to prepare for this there's an old adage if you've failed to plan you plan to fail this was a complete failure because we didn't have a plan of action and what they said was disturbing because it predicted exactly what was going to happen if we didn't act fast and yet even with that warning President Biden and secretary blinken failed to change course to the very end rather than prioritizing U.S national security and the safety of thousands of Americans they forced this rapid withdrawal of U.S troops from Afghanistan on an artificial timeline I remember it's going to be September the 11th what an insult to the victims of 9 11 that was going to happen on 9 11. we all know they stopped fighting in the wintertime why wouldn't you why wouldn't you plan it at a time that made sense and then the shutdown of Bagram Air Base our ISR crown jewels to see Russia China and Iran and the terrorists in the region was shut down in the dead of night it was not driven by National Security it was driven by politics you know the idea that you're going to drop troop levels to 650 service members to do this is insane and once we abandoned Bagram I'm sure we'll hear this from Jacob Smith you know 12 000 prisoners are released into Afghanistan Isis cave the suicide bomber released from Bagram seven billion dollars of equipment left behind and now they're selling it to our adversaries and to terrorist Nations and yet we made zero seems to me very little attempts to get the men and women who fought alongside U.S servicemen out of that country to safety and our partners our interpreters are now left behind to be hunted down by the Taliban with a very Biometrics that we created and now they can go door to door to get a fingerprint to confirm if they worked with the United States and then they're executed to me it's sad that after 20 years of blood and treasure where are we now with the women the Taliban in control the geopolitical issues that face you know China now is there for God's sakes and the lithium China will probably get access to Bagram it's hard for me to tell the veterans that and the suicide rate is so high and to them I tell them it was worth it because you made this country safe for 20 years I chaired the homeland security committee we stopped a lot of external operations to kill Americans it's because men and women like these two and your sons and daughters were there getting that intelligence to make this country safe so I wanted to again thank the families for being here I can't imagine the grief that you have but I can tell you that we are going to hold that we're going to uncover what happened we're going to uncover transparency and accountability is very important to me and I think to all members of this committee and we want accountability and I will not rest until we get that and I promise you that while the president wants to sweep this under the rug that I will never forget what happened and I will hold people accountable and we will on this committee ensure that something like this never ever happens again in the United States of America the greatest country in the world so I want to thank the chairman for holding this hearing with that I yield back thank you chairman McCall a little bit of procedure that we have to do here gentlemen first of all I ask unanimous consent that the following members be allowed to sit on the dice and participate in today's hearing

full statements will be made a part of the record and I'll ask each of you to keep your spoken remarks to roughly five minutes to ensure all members have time for questions I now recognize Colonel kromrick for your opening statement good morning I want to start by thanking chairman McColl chairman Mast ranking member Meeks ranking member Crow and the members of the committee and subcommittee I also want to pass a special thanks to the members of the committee who served in Afghanistan and a special thanks to the gold star family members that are here in attendance today I appreciate your invitation to speak today my goal or the goal of my testimony is to help the committee understand how the administration and the military's planning process functioned throughout Afghanistan's withdrawal and illuminate the points of failure that Doom the effort we're all painfully aware of the terrible Optics of our departure and the utter failure in Afghanistan My Hope Is this testimony provides Clarity highlighting what worked what failed and how we can avoid making the same mistakes in the future it's important to acknowledge our three strategic objectives and end States for the withdrawal the first was to maintain an ongoing diplomatic presence the second was to support Afghan Security Forces people and the government and the third was prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a safe haven for terrorism we were not successful I'll separate our planning efforts into two categories first strategic decision failures and second the planning process and its effect on Mission execution four critical strategic decision failures set the conditions in the environment from the entire withdrawal first failure to follow the Doha agreement fundamental to our Doha agreement were seven conditions that the Taliban had to meet that would trigger our full withdrawal from Afghanistan an agreement only works if both sides participate the Taliban failed six of seven conditions example one key provision was the reduction of Violence by both sides we greatly curtailed our air support to the Afghan forces weakening their offensive capability while the Taliban increased their attacks by up to 70 percent yet we still began our withdrawal giving no incentive for the Taliban to follow any of the Doha agreement provisions therefore both sides failed the Taliban to follow the basics of the agreement and we failed to enforce the agreement the statement we held up our end of the bargain Rings Hollow and naive when our duplicitous partner never tried or intended to support the agreement second selective intelligence blindness senior decision makers rely heavily on intelligence to make the right decision both for what to do and when to do it the Trap decision makers fall into is selectively choosing intelligence to support their favorite course of action rather than letting the intelligence and inform and shape their decisions a five-month full retrograde operation with a transition of power to a questionable Afghan government only makes sense if you believe the Taliban will not threaten the outcome and the Afghan government is ready to lead the administration made that determination based on intelligence that overestimated the Afghan government's capabilities and wished away the taliban's capabilities there is very little Intel evidence to suggest that the Biden administration's plan would work and a mountain range of evidence to suggest the plan would fail General milley General Miller and general McKenzie all recommended not withdrawing until the Doha agreement conditions were met these seasoned experts were ignored and the best case scenario plan to withdraw immediately started the domino effect to catastrophe third bad timing the withdrawal window made of September of 21 was planned during the peak of the well-known Afghan fighting season the Taliban were at their strongest most aggressive and logistically capable during this time period why would we leave fragile Afghan governments vulnerable to the taliban's strongest advantage why did the tactically meaningless 20-year anniversary of 9 11 Drive the timeline ripping out U.S military support with little to no warning at the height of December fighting season led to disastrous results with the aggressive Taliban on the March the U.N reported Afghanistan suffered its highest civilian casualty count on record not because of international military action but because of Afghan on Afghan violence and number four limited time for DOD and interagency to fully plan and execute the withdrawal Mission and the subsequent and separate Neo mission the military has a planning Maxim one third time to plan two-thirds time to rehearse before we execute the operation there was no time for traditional military planning to include looking at worst case scenarios in real detail to meet the 11th September timeline we had to plan immediately and execute now Prudence in patients were replaced by speed of action without the time to study the consequences and mitigate those risks shifting to the plan the bottom line is the administration controlled how we withdrew and when we withdrew making them the majority stakeholder of many guilty parties in the failure and collapse of Afghanistan in the current Taliban rule how the plan was chosen the new Administration Administration discussed options between February and April of 21 with the National Security Council u.s4a and centcom offer their best experience advice in the form of courses of action that provided the administration distinct options based on troop levels timelines conditions and end States the president's decision to ignore the best military advice and execute an immediate military withdrawal was a shock and a rude awakening for all the planners there was a sense of dread and cynicism based on the timeline and the enemy threat given the strict guidance centcom executed a fast retrograde to provide the best Force protection for our service members reducing their exposure to any potential enemy action it was impressive in scope and scale achieving success by mid-july but the unintended consequence of an unannounced and immediate departure of a trusted Ally was the demoralizing impact it had in Afghan units at the height of the taliban's fighting season the brittle Afghan military collapsed many units quit those that stayed and fought found their reinforcements resupply and air support had abandoned them damning them to be captured or executed by the Taliban I highly recommend watching the documentary retrograde which captures this horror first hand the Neo by mid-july and the successful withdrawal of our military the Taliban tripled the number of districts they controlled from 78 to over 200 of Afghanistan's 419 districts and just two months they achieved irreversible momentum to take Kandahar and ultimately Cobble in the next month while centcom was hyper focused on executing the withdrawal the NSC level tabletop exercises in DC lacked the granular detail required to identify the Achilles heel of the Neo the state Department's broken special immigrant Visa process that would directly lead to the humanitarian crisis at the hkiah gates again our military executed an unprecedented airlift of over a hundred twenty thousand U.S citizens and Visa holders largest in U.S history however the Afghan allies who plan to stay and run the government could not secure a visa to leave the country and were trapped with their families at the chaotic H Kyle walls pop-up ad hoc groups like Pineapple Express and the Afghan Evac and x-fill network sprung up to help our Afghan friends when our government failed and abandoned our allies I provide a first-hand account in my written testimony of Brigadier General Latif as families experience as an example looking at these decisions in total it becomes clear our Hasty actions set the conditions for the Afghan government's collapse the Taliban slingshot to power and the loss of 20 years of Hope and progress in the Afghan people in conclusion fighting a war and establishing a sovereign government means we have the moral responsibility to end the conflict and withdraw our military in a deliberate and responsible manner we failed the enemy rules Afghanistan we owe our killed in action wounded in action gold star family members combat veterans their families our allies and the current bill payers the men and women still trapped in Afghanistan under the heel of the Taliban especially the women and the girls a full accounting of our missteps and a commitment to never let this happen again thank you for the opportunity to speak today I look forward to answering your questions thank you Colonel comrick I now recognize Colonel kolenda for your opening statement thank you so much for the opportunity and the honor to be here and I also want to recognize our gold star families and uh devastated by your loss of what happened at the at the Abbey gate I know we're talking about a different date but July 27th which is today is very uh important day for me 16 years ago today my unit was involved in the biggest fire fight we had in the 450-day deployment in Afghanistan hundreds of insurgent Fighters attempted to trap one of our units in a valley floor in uh nuristan Province Eastern neristan Province or the border of Pakistan staff sergeant Ryan fritchie while reconordering a place to employ his Squad against the enemy was shot and killed he was awarded the Bronze Star for Valor and is buried outside of Indianapolis Indiana and Hall Indiana a few minutes later Captain Tom Bostic now Major Tom Bostic was leading this company and his command post came under overwhelming attack he directed the members of his command post to move to a different position where they could could continue taking the fight to the enemy Tom single-handedly counter-attacked by fire this large enemy Force he was killed by a rocket-propelled grenade it's a boom I still hear he was awarded the distinguished service cross for his actions that day we lost four more soldiers that Thomas buried at Arlington gravesite 87-55 he's originally from Llano Texas we lost four other soldiers in that 450-day deployment private first class Chris Pfeiffer buried in Spaulding Nebraska Sergeant Adrian hike buried in Carroll Iowa specialist Jacob Lowell who's buried at the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery outside of Chicago Illinois and Captain Dave Boris who was who is buried in Minersville Pennsylvania watching the collapse of Afghanistan in August of 20 21 and I had a number of emotions just like everybody else here I watched with sadness and horror at the attack on Abby gate that cost 13 of our service members lives I was angry we've been at this for 20 years we've spent over two trillion dollars more than 2 300 service members killed tens of thousands with wounds both seen and unseen and it all came crashing down like a house of cards I was disgusted disgusted knowing that Afghan military commanders were creating ghost soldiers so they could take their the pay uh they were selling their soldiers food Fuel and ammunition on the black market as a part of the uh the kleptocracy that had become the Afghan government and to see the fact that Afghan senior officials just seemed to Take the Money and Run and I was disappointed disappointed that another war ended in disaster I mean Vietnam Iraq Afghanistan you know one disaster is a horrible accident two disasters is a tragic coincidence three disasters in these large-scale interventions fighting insurgencies is a disturbing Trend that suggests that we are not learning from experience in fact I wrote this book zero-sum Victory what we're getting wrong about war it looks at the three conflicts and the repeated errors The Chronic errors that we make in each one at the policy and strategy level that are increasing the risk that these wars turn into disasters you know in each case our troops fight valiantly they do exactly what they're told they do it to a very high standard but too often the policy and strategy are not worthy of their sacrifice and that's got to change I agree that we have an opportunity not to repeat the mistakes of the past but if we don't address these policy and strategy errors that we continue making then we are likely to have a fourth disaster in our next military major military intervention and that I find totally unacceptable in my written testimony I talk about three of the immediate causes of the collapse in Afghanistan I also address some of the systemic failures that are common to the three uh recent Wars that I mentioned and also some low-cost High payoff reforms that we can make today that reduce the risk of another disaster while increasing the probability that we're going to be successful in our next conflict and I'll be delighted to take questions about those uh in during a q a thank you very much for the opportunity thank you Colonel that well you said very much stuck with me in my mind too often the policy and strategy are not worthy of their sacrifice we need to make sure that it always is always and I think we're all United in that and I now recognize Command Sergeant Major Smith for your opening statement members of the committee it's an honor to be able to come here today and speak before you and uh to the gold star families it's an honor to be in your presence it truly is my name is Command Sergeant sergeant major Jake Smith I use my rank and title only to identify myself and my position to speak on this matter I tested by before before you not in His official representative of the United States Army but as a citizen I must preface my testimony by making it abundantly clear that I am not here to place blame on any organization or individual for the results of our Nations and days in Afghanistan it is not my place as a soldier to do so it is merely my duty to present this committee with the facts I know to be true so that you may make a well-informed decision I want to make it known that I have little insight into the overarching strategic planning of the Afghanistan withdrawal by every area of expertise comes from the Tactical planning and execution of the closure of Bagram Air Base and the recommendations I made to members of the U.S embassy in Kabul regarding a non-combat combatant evacuation I will stick to the facts and circumstances I personally personally witnessed and offer minimal of personal opinion I very respectfully ask that any questions you ask of me keep to the facts of the matter and shy away from any personal beliefs or opinions I may hold from October 11 2020 to 2 July 2021 I served as the area support group of Afghanistan or ASG command sergeant major the duties and responsibilities of ASG included all base life support functions for the remaining nine U.S military installations in Afghanistan these functions included billeting dining facilities Public Works Sanitation and emergency response a particular importance to my testimony is my understanding of the life support capabilities of Bagram and H Kaya in May 2021 I was given the additional duty to serve as the Bagram senior enlisted advisor this Duty included the oversight of all Force protection measures and entry control points on Bagram of particular importance to my testimony was my understanding of the security posture of Bagram and its capabilities it was sometime in the spring that we received the first tentative date to work towards in finalizing our go to zero effort September 11 2021. the order came to begin to close all the smaller bases but two were left in question Bagram and H Kaya for those two installations there was a looming a question of whether or not they would close part of General Miller's guidance was to main order discipline and dignity as we collapse we would not just up and leave we would hand over exceptionally orderly bases to the Afghan government we are instructed to get as small as we could but still function on the chance that Bagram would be used in future efforts this presented a significant issue to Bagram as we could not collapse to the point of inoperability we would have to have the Personnel vital to running power security and sanitation if we began to close the base infrastructure too aggressively we would not be able to function and maintain Security on Bagram if it was to remain open it was sometime in March or April that I first met with planners from the U.S embassy four planners came to Bagram to conduct a site survey to determine if Bagram was the appropriate spot to conduct a non-combatant evacuation in this conversation I was told that H Kaya would be the other option prior to this meeting I had reviewed the contingency plan for a Neo that had been created years prior the contingency plan accounted for forty five thousand to fifty thousand persons that would need to be evacuated it was members of the embassy team who informed me that the actual number would be anywhere from 120 000 to 140 000. I advise the embassy team against using H Kaya for the following reasons Bagram could house 35 000 people without overloading the infrastructure whereas H Kaya could only hold roughly three thousand H Kyle was a shared Airfield it was not completely controlled by the military it had significant weak points in the security Bagram had a completely secure Airfield that would require a massive military offenses to overrunner breach hko was surrounded by the the city of Kabul and is 4.4 million residents if there was to be a fight it would be in an urban environment and exceptionally difficult to undertaken control Bagram had a small town on the western edge an open train in the majority of the north east and west movement of any kind could be detected controlled or eliminated very early the defend ability of Bagram was exponentially that greater than that of age Kaya Bagram held the logistical capability to meet the requirements of 130 000 people Bagram had over 35 000 bed spaces and could create more using cots within the air Airfield hangers if necessary Bagram had four dining facilities and food that could have fed those fleeing Bagram had tens of thousands of gallons of potable water and on-site water for purification capabilities H Kaya did not Bagram had a rule 3 Hospital meaning that it had the greatest life-saving capability of any Hospital remaining in Afghanistan hkiah had a roll to hospital meaning that it had a degraded capability to that of Bagram finally Bagram had four industrial size incinerators it had two industrial size material shredders it had the mechanical capability to destroy sensitive equipment on an industrial scale in a short amount of time H Kaya did not when I laid out all my points to the site survey team they verbally agreed with my assessment I met twice more with this site survey team once in May and
