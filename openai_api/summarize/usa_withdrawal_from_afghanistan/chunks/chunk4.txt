I was not there but I can say that these contingencies were very well rehearsed and planned for in Bagram how many air strips at Bagram how many runways there are two main runways that you can take off from that I am aware of was it practice that they may be down to one Runway at H Kaya I don't know that it was a lot of these questions that we can ask about what was practiced what was planned for what was prepared for and as I think about the the hundreds of those that I can ask largely the answer comes back to it wasn't thought about whether it was because there wasn't given the time to think about it or if somebody thought about it somebody didn't want to hear about it they wanted maybe they wanted a plausible deniability I won't pretend to put myself into somebody else's mind but there was a a willful ignorance that took place with this withdrawal cost the lives of service members it looked like you had a comment on that before I finish up I'm happy to hear you out Mr crummer or Mr colonel I thought I saw your head school you know it appeared to me as though there was a willful ignorance I think the facts bear that out and I can't say anything more than what my colleagues have already said on this other than that it cost unnecessarily the lives of our service members and it leaves those that are still serving and those that are still mourning with the question of what has changed and I can't come away after several hours of questioning with you all and tell them this is what has changed this is who learned the lesson and who would say yes I would absolutely do that differently and that's not what I want to be left with that's all I can say on that for now in that I'm going to we did have somebody else join us very good Mr Banks I recognize you for five minutes I thank the chairman for holding this hearing it's so important and to this point no one has yet been held accountable for the disastrous deadly embarrassing withdrawal from Afghanistan in fact last year General Frank McKenzie then uh General retired General um in charge of centcom said he himself had many regrets about what happened in Afghanistan in March of this year I asked secretary Austin before the house armed services committee sir do you have any regrets General McKenzie has regrets General Austin secretary of defense for the United States of America overseeing this withdrawal do you have any regrets he said I have no regrets and I wonder from each of you how does that make you feel when you hear the top leader of our Pentagon of our military say he has no regrets about what will happen in Afghanistan Colonel we'll start with you extremely frustrated and let down you know I lost six soldiers for my unit in Afghanistan in 2007 and the fact that there has not been a examination of why these failures Vietnam Iraq Afghanistan why these failures keep happening um is is very frustrating to me because it seems that the next time we get into one of these interventions we're going to make the same basic mistakes and it's going to heighten the risk of another disaster and that that I find unacceptable sir this is my current leadership and I am not in a position to speak on the matter of this question understood hopefully one day you'll be able to tell us what you really think a colonel respond to secretary Austin though I mean the the arrogance to say that I mean the families behind you of who lost loved ones the heroes that we lost that that deadly day and other deadly days in Afghanistan to say that you have no regrets I mean to me it was as a veteran of the war in Afghanistan who served with others who Heroes that we lost to say I have no regrets and yeah okay respond to that colonel all combat veterans have regrets you know I've been very fortunate where the VA has been able to help me and I've got a support team that helps me work through that every day but I find that comment tone deaf and not Tethered to reality you have to have regrets you should it looks like September 10 2001 there now it's only getting worse there's nothing but regret and pain and struggle there so I find that statement to be wildly um painful for everyone who's had to put in Blood Sweat and Tears for the families that lost their family members I mean it's it's got me absolutely livid I don't know what I would say to him um but I strongly disagree on every level yeah can you unpack more about what happened leading up to the withdrawal there's been a lot a lot of discussion today about the decision to close down Bagram and rely on the very public airport in Kabul to withdraw but can you can you tell us more about for someone for for General Austin who led troops in Afghanistan to say has no regrets can you talk more about that that decision to close down Bagram that led to the deadly the devastation that happened in Kabul um how could how could he say he has no regrets when obviously those were terrible decisions that were made I can't speak for secretary Austin I can explain why that happened from a planner's perspective because this idea and this concept that we would be able to run this diplomatic Island in perpetuity and Kabul was something that the administration decided that's what was going to happen and they forgot that the enemy gets a vote and that they wished away a lot of these other issues that clearly came to pass that everybody was warning not just the military leadership but also the interagency and the intelligence Community was just telegraphing this every day um I I find it um I guess I just cannot figure out the decision making um I know why they picked HK because it was close to the Embassy and they just fell in love with their plan yeah I spent a lot of time in both places Bagram and um the north North Kaya throughout Kabul it's a decision that will never make sense to me and I hope one day we can unpack it more I want to finish with one quick question my time is almost expired representative Mills dug into this question president Trump let us down a path to withdraw from Afghanistan but to keep a light footprint of Special Operation Forces there in place and I wonder Colonel if if we would have adopted that plan that course of action would those lives likely have been saved that day speaking as a retired Greenbrier myself um I have no doubt in my mind that if we had Green Berets seals Air Force Special Operations marshock out holding the picket line with our Afghan especially the Afghan soft that were there we would have studied we would have studied much much greater chance to build time and space to work on all the things that needed to be worked on in Kabul yeah thank you for that answer to the families who are here I will spend the rest of my time in Congress fighting for accountability for those who made this ridiculous and stupid decisions that led to the loss of your loved ones I promise you that with that Mr chairman I yield back thank you my friend I'm now going to recognize Mr Crowe for five minutes for a closing statement thank you chairman and thank you to all the witnesses for coming in today um there was a lot of ground covered I appreciate uh your your candor and your testimony and your work uh and again I want to recognize the gold star families for being here um I I can't imagine how challenging it is to listen to this and to rehash this and to see some of those videos which of course we needed to see right the American people and we all need to see that we can't shy away from the reality uh but uh for being here today I'm grateful I'm going to do two things I first want to address some issues that I I think were incorrect but that some of my colleagues uh made some statements and then the second is I want to provide some context about the timeline and the situation as I see it number one a lot of comments about the president's statement uh classifying the the withdrawal as a success and criticism of that statement that statement to be clear was within the context of him applauding the work of the military and and our troops and our soldiers right in in applauding their sacrifice and their service for with the with the withdrawal and that's the same type of statement that I would make that they they worked hard under extraordinarily difficult circumstances under circumstances that uh they largely shouldn't have had to have addressed but they did their job and they did it well and they did they did it remarkably and that's what the president was talking about uh second a couple of folks have mentioned you know that we haven't had any testimony from officials involved in the withdrawal or even active Administration officials that have come before this committee um that's because the majority hasn't called them right so uh you know your testimony has been great and I've appreciated it at all but if the majority wants to hear from those folks it's the majority that can call a panel of uh sitting officials so I think that criticism is a non-sequitur as well um a second is is you can you can disagree about the logistics in the timeline but there's also been a number of comments that have outright Sid that Administration and certain officials and including lifelong service members people who have dedicated their life to this country accuse them of lying of covering things up of executing the truth listen there's just no indication that anyone's acting in bad faith and has lied now I disagree with folks all the time I have my disagreement with uniform people I have my disagreement with the administration sometimes in a variety of issues whether it's Afghanistan or Ukraine because I have an independent obligation as a member of Congress to to uphold My Views right and I'm not just going to rubber stamp anybody but to be clear I I've never I've never for an instant thought that anyone's acting in bad faith or wanted U.S soldiers to be killed or put into a difficult situation or lied about anything so let's just be real about that right I think we owe it to folks to have disagreements and debate about um the facts but accusing people of bad faith is just not appropriate so for my part I I did disagree with the timeline I I was very vocal in 2021 that the withdrawal and the evacuation should have started earlier uh I I uh we talked about it in the media I pressed folks for it I thought that as soon as the president announced in April of 2021 that we were going to abide by the Doha agreement and and withdrawal that that withdrawal should have happened earlier and we could have spread it out and could have done it in a more methodical way so that's my disagreement that's my view but the situation was a tough one and I do want to provide that perspective very quickly in the time that I have president Trump engaged his representatives in the Taliban to negotiate the Doha agreement the Doha agreement was agreed to and we started our reduction of troops as a result of that the and I want to enter into the record an open statement before this Committee in June of 2021 by Deputy special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation Ambassador Molly fee if I may and in this statement which is in the record I won't read the whole thing it says very clear that there's no indication that that the prior Administration took into account the taliban's compliance with that agreement when they made the unilateral decision to withdraw troops this is the ambassador who was in the room uh said this no indication that was going to happen so we had a situation where the Taliban knew we were pulling out that Pollard had already started we were at the lowest troop levels in years the Taliban was advancing taking provinces taking capitals had the momentum was on the March and in January of 2021 when President Biden came into office they had no transition Because by the way the prior Administration actually wasn't even recognizing this Administration as the lawful president so they didn't even they didn't even transition with their people on noon on January 20th 2021 so they walked in knowing nothing having no transition having no briefings no plans in place they embarked on a two-month process to try to get their hands around the issue and figure out what was going on then they made the decision to abide by the agreement because we had very few troops there we were we were being told and the intelligence was showing that the Taliban was going to start attacking us again if we didn't withdraw on time so the decision the president had to make was one of two things withdrawal under the timeline and do it as quickly as possible or stay there and fight and fight hard and fight harder than we would have had to have fought for years and U.S soldiers would have been fighting and dying then too tough decisions so yes things could have been done differently I'm very clear about that and there are Lessons Learned and we will make sure with the chairman and working with my colleagues we learn these lessons and do it better but there is a broader context that was important and it's not as simple as some folks would like you to believe it is I yield back I think the ranking member for his closing statement I recognize myself for a closing statement we tend to go after each other from time to time but I don't think it wanes on our recognition of each other's service proud to have chewed the same dirt as you I hope that you would join me in an invitation to the ultimate decision maker to sit before us and answer questions about this I would certainly offer that invitation I do disagree I believe that there were people literally working I would say speaking in bad faith and I say that as I was doing my preparation for this hearing and this didn't just take place in this week I've done timeline after timeline over the years but specifically in preparation for this hearing I have probably a dozen Pages at least of the comments the remarks from the White House from Jennifer sake and I know when I layer those on top of what was actually going on at the time what she was telling the American people in representation of President Biden was not what was taking place day after day daily coming to the to the Press pool speaking saying something was happening or going to happen and then it's simply not being the reality of what the ultimate decision makers knew what was really taking place and we know I guess we could say we have testimony that there was selective reading of the intelligence as is always the case intelligence comes in varying degrees of confidence and we didn't really get into the confidence of the intelligence that was presented today maybe there's another day that we'll get into it but in my personal opinion there was not inadequate amount of planning that was done and there was not planning that was done to take into account what was probable and what was possible it was planning at the smallest level to take into account what was hoped for and I've said this before and I will say it again now is my closing remarks I'm well aware of the fact that sometimes in war there is just bad luck a bullet is an inch or two inches to the left or right if it could have gone the other way you don't even know that something would have happened in RPG and a piece of fragmentation little piece of aluminum fragmentation catches a person a soldier in the wrong place a mortar hits too close to some place you're too close to a vehicle born IED all the possible hazards that exist in war sometimes it is bad luck in my assessment what happened in the withdrawal of Afghanistan was not bad luck it was bad planning it was bad objectives it was a failure to practice and it resulted in incredibly bad results for some of our very best and for the United States of America and our allies as a whole in that I will conclude my closing remarks I will thank each of you Witnesses for your testimonies I found it to be frank forthright and I feel as though I am better informed for having listened to you each of you today so I thank you for that I thank our gold star families for again for joining us as all of our colleagues have to thank you thank you and and rightly so you raised Patriots and we've had an opportunity to speak about the pain that you've gone through I wouldn't begin to say that I could understand it because I couldn't put myself in that place I don't even like to see my boys or my little girls stub their toe I couldn't imagine what you deal with day in Day Out but I know I'm thankful to you for what you shared with this country those that you love the most and in that I will say whatever the formal part of this tells me to say pursue it to committee rules all members may have five days to submit statements questions and extraneous materials for the record subject to the length of limitations without objection the committee stands adjourned thank you
