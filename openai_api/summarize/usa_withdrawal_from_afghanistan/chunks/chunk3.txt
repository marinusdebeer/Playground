the timing the Manning the location all of the witnesses have talked about one of the things that we haven't really um totally addressed in my opinion was the command climate and this goes all the way to the top I'm an ER doctor I'm also a military pilot military ER doctors matter of fact both in the ER and in the cockpit when things start going wrong I've empowered everybody in the room to stop me I don't like to land here I don't feel comfortable there's something wrong with this the way we're approaching there's something wrong with the way we're doing our mission in the ER if I'm given the wrong drug or give me the wrong command anybody in the room can question me at the time that's a command climate which keeps me from making mistakes the question is as you commanders or boots on the ground we're executing the mission as you saw it but you're giving feedback I assume in the same command climate I don't feel comfortable with this do you feel like you are empowered and had been heard and acknowledged in your concerns I'll start with the kernels within the military structure and the plan there is a lot of transparency on the options that we presented and then the directive that we and the orders that we received that we needed to execute as I had remarked earlier there was some shock or there's a lot of shock there's some cynicism because a lot of us had a really bad feeling of what was going to happen however I will say that the military leaders General McKenzie general milley you know they do what we do in the military they followed orders they did the best that they could with this and we executed the best that we had the ability to do it and there were some tough days you know having to watch Joe McKenzie get on TV and talk about Abby gate was really really difficult and he had a serious burden to carry on his shoulders um and I think what gets you through that is knowing that we're doing the best that we can in the military we executed too and FDR said no we're going to go into North Africa um Truman disagreed with MacArthur about about the atomic bomb so so it's not unusual for leaders to take all that in because they have to look at a wider aperture and maybe make an unpopular decision so I'm just speaking historically I'm not so let's get into that real quick if I may uh because we're running short on time but it's interesting you're right and and when we make the right decision we're all held for it right but when we make the wrong decision the only way to learn from it is to say I made the wrong decision the problem is in this case command sergeant major I know that you would look at the board your command your command structure all the way to the very top who's at the top of your chain of command that's the president of the United States president of the United States commander-in-chief now we can say when McClellan and Lincoln disagreed we can say when Ike or anybody else disagree can talk about when generals are relieved and we can learn from those lessons but we cannot learn from a lesson when it's an abject failure and no admission of any mistakes we talk about learning when our when I when they when my my friends across the aisle say we just need to learn from this we need to stop playing politics with it but we cannot learn if we do not admit it stakes and that's the problem I'm talking about the command climate I can't learn if my patient dies on the table and nobody can tell me that I did anything wrong in the ER I can't learn certainly if I crash my helicopter and anybody dies from my mistake in this case I feel like we crashed and learned nothing because we can't even admit the mistakes that we made from the very top and that's my concern because if we're going to go into this look we even have a problem right now we continue policy and we don't talk about this very much but we're continuing to spend billions of dollars now this doesn't have to do with the withdrawal directly this has to do with what's happening right now the American people need to know the Afghan fun which is basically subsequently been transferred 3.5 billion in seized assets from the fund with the purpose of stabilizing the Afghan uh Central banking system of course the Taliban basically takes that and used it for whatever they want to we're supporting a terrorist organization essentially in the idea that we're doing something right this is continued failed policy because we haven't learned from our mistakes this is what drives me crazy we have a command climate inside of our own government that doesn't listen to our military leaders who know what they're doing doesn't listen to Congress or anybody else because they think they know best and they continue to screw it up that's a bad command climb I don't care if we're talking politics or militar or anything else and that's what we have to learn from that's what we're here for today and with that I thank you Mr chair and I yield now I recognize Mr Perry for five minutes thanks Mr chairman gentlemen thanks for your service thanks for coming I'm over here look I will tell you um I still haven't gotten over the withdrawal from Iraq and the 4 500 plus lives lost there for what seems to be nothing and what to say to those families of course Afghanistan's right up there and you know I was around watching as a young man or a young boy the Huey leaving the the top of the embassy in Hanoi and I remember the rhetoric this time where it was not going to be like that it was not going to be like leaving Vietnam we weren't going to see that scene and we didn't see that scene right it was a chinook flying with the mountains in the background or a C-17 with Afghans hanging off the bottom of it and falling to their death it is it is unimaginable to people like me and I imagine to folks like you who wore the uniform and you know look we all know the mantra ours is not to question why or is it just to do and die and we get that right we all get that we signed up for that but at the same time the American people demand accountability for their lost for the blood that's lost for their family members that are never coming back for the equipping of the largest terrorist organization on the planet at the uh you know at the the heel of the American taxpayer and so we got to do our job here we understand that you're carrying out orders and they're imperfect and you don't know what the answer is and policy makers sometimes don't know what the answer is we get that right nobody's perfect we all fall short of the grace of God but when we make mistakes we've got to learn from them so we don't continue the same failed policy it is our job to get accountability not just to assign blame but so that we don't make the same dumb mistakes again because lives are precious and nobody's going to join the service nobody's going to join Uniform service if they know that no one here gives a damn whether they live or die right we all love our country we all want to do the right things sergeant major I I'm just so I and I was at the time and I still remain concerned about using hkia as opposed to as opposed to Bagram or yeah Bagram was there a pre-existing backup plan do you know or was it always that plan and and I know that you had to collapse but still stay operable but you couldn't collapse to the to the extent that you had to and stay operable plus you're also required to secure the embassy which is not on the same location knowing that you didn't have the forces available to secure both or probably either one was there a plan so there there was a pre-existing uh Neo plan that neoplan uh I'm not sure when it was uh penned exactly I want to say it was around 2012 but in that plan the plan was to conduct a Neo out of Bagram and and when was it to be what was there was it just a backup that it was going to be a choice of either location or was it we're going to use this one and if this one fails we're going to go to that one do you know what the determination what was the determining factor of which one to use because everything was set up for Bagram but nothing was set up for hkia so the uh the plan for Bagram um you know being it was uh written in 2012 um we couldn't predict what was going to happen in the future right the enemy always gets a vote right all no plan survives first Contact correct so what the the exact triggers were in that plan it never from my recollection of that plan it was about an 800 page document I do not recall what the uh the triggers specifically were to launch in Neo well it just seems look you know we none of us here want a Monday Morning Quarterback especially if you weren't there even those of us who have worn the uniform but in retrospect well as it was happening all of us I think that have worn the uniform were scratch in our heads saying that was the hard point that was the place where we were most prepared to make a stand and to evacuate from that's where we're operating out of that's where everything was located that's where we're familiar why in the hell did we not do that and and look there was a lot of lives lost we don't want to focus solely on the ones that were lost in the final days when it seems like it's for nothing absolutely because every single one of them is precious in my remaining time Mr krumrick I think you mentioned the concept of selective intelligence and the issues that it posed on the mission what if you know now after the fact what was not mentioned what was if you know exactly ignored through the selective intelligence blindness and what can we learn from that the plan that was order to the military to execute goes back to the first objective of the withdrawal and the post withdrawal which was having that diplomatic base set in Kabul and that looked like the embassy and then about the four miles over to H Kaya the problem with that is it ignored all of the Taliban threat which we have described here today of which had only been getting steadily more refined uh and more dangerous over 20 years and so when you pick that plan but you choose to not acknowledge or protect against this red storm that's coming it just leaves you flabbergasted of how did you think this was going to go and my times expired and they're good people that have been waiting to ask a question I just got to follow up with one quick one based on that because that's what everyone else sees why why did that why did we just ignore and and why and who who made the decision to ignore if you can pinpoint it and and look we can't ascribe motives but what do you pretend or what do you suppose is the motive to ignore it I was not in the room I know what was recommended as the course of action and I know what was given back to us to execute and what was given back to us to execute was not what we recommended so someone above the four-star level is the one who made the decision to Do It ultimately it resides with the president um so somewhere in there would be the uh the person that you're trying to identify Roger God bless you thank you thank you Mr Perry we're now going to go to Mr Crane for five minutes thank you Mr chairman for allowing me to join the diocese today thank you everyone who's shown up here as Witnesses and I also want to thank them especially thank the families the gold star families that are here today I want to agree with a couple of my colleagues that have spoke already on this topic Congressman Mills and Congressman Walsh who have talked about this argument on the other side of the aisle that's complete garbage that this administration had no choice because they were basically just tracking with what the administration prior had been leading up to and I also want to double tap on some of the things that they said because clearly this Administration did not continue the policies of the previous administration when it came to our border energy economics and so many other things so I want to debunk and fact check that false claim right now because that's exactly what it is I also want to acknowledge that this Administration did not listen to the leaders on the ground the generals that were recommending against their plan many of the witnesses have testified so far that that's one of the main mistakes we've made in previous Wars where people in suits back in Washington do not listen to commanders on the ground I also want to acknowledge that we left behind seven billion in equipment and gear 40 000 Vehicles 300 000 weapons all comms equipment and this is the thing that scares me the most is somebody who's served in the SEAL Teams nearly all night vision equipment and anybody who's ever done Special Operations in Modern Warfare knows how dangerous this is going to be to the next group of Americans or next group of allies that goes in there to deal with some unfriendly individuals all biometric equipment which is now being used to hunt down our allies I cannot even believe that that when I when I read that report I was like oh my God even for this Administration that's appalling now I want to point out something that bothers me severely when John Kirby the White House spokesman on April 6 2023 made the quote in a press conference all this talk of chaos I just didn't see it Colonel krumrick did you hear John Kirby say that I did not hear him say that but I wildly disagree with that statement Colonel kolinda did you hear him say that did you watch that on TV I did not see it on TV but that sentiment makes me uh sick to my stomach yep 13 dead soldiers let me ask you guys something do the soldiers that have lost their lives and these families these gold star families especially the ones in the room today do they deserve that this Administration and our leaders take ownership of the leadership failures that led to this catastrophe Colonel Chrome I'll start with you the Sacrifice by the gold star families and the loss of the 13 service members is something that haunts all of us um you know I had a chance to talk to them before we came in here and I did tell them the story of General Latif and his family who they saved and are now living in the United States and are a success story for what happens when you bring these folks out um but their loss is something that I'll never accept thank you that is not what I asked you sir I asked you if they deserve that our leaders who were in charge of this debacle take ownership absolutely how about you Colonel Cole Linda in terms of ownership there's both accepting responsibility for decisions and also determining cause for why these disasters right this particular disaster happen and why they keep happening and that's where I'd like to see the accountability sergeant major do these families in these marines and these soldiers deserve that leadership take accountability sir I have a son and a daughter if uh something were to happen to them in this same regard I would want answers absolutely Mr chairman I've got two more questions I'll make them quick to the family sitting behind you that are still clearly Mourning by a NADA your head yes or no do you feel like this Administration has taken ownership and accountability yes or no I didn't think so neither do the American people the last thing I want to ask you gentlemen is this Colonel krumwick are you worried about this current chain of commands response that is responsible for This Disaster are you worried about them being able to be successful in the war that we are now careening towards in Ukraine are you are you worried about their ability to be successful in that war because we've talked a lot today about avoiding past mistakes we've seen what they're capable of are you guys concerned about it I am concerned about the administration's ability to do it I am not concerned about the military leaders we have because they're the finest cut of the American fabric thank you sir what about you Colonel colinder I'm not an expert on the Ukraine fight so I can't give you a good answer okay thank you I yield back thank you very much we are now going to move to Mr Gonzalez for five minutes uh thank you chairman mass for for hosting this event thank you Witnesses for coming up many of the people that have spent time in this room today is what I call part of the warrior warrior class and the warrior class is is built on uh fighting and winning wars that our Nations fought uh part of that is honoring the fallen and I want to start by mentioning all 13 names we don't mention the 13 soldiers Sailors that were killed uh about a year ago so Corman Maxton Slovak 22 years old from Berlin Heights Ohio staff sergeant Darwin Hoover 31 years old from Salt Lake City Utah Sergeant Johnny picardo 25 from Lawrence Massachusetts Sergeant Nicole G 23 from Sacramento California Corporal Hunter Lopez 22 from Indio California Corporal Degen Peg 23 page 23 from Omaha Nebraska Corporal Humberto Sanchez 22 from Logansport Indiana Marine Corporal Lance Lance corporal Espinoza from Rio Bravo Texas Lance corporal Schmidt 20 from Saint Charles Missouri Lance corporal McCullum 20 years old from Jackson Wyoming Lance corporal miliola from Rancho cucamanda Cucamonga California Lance corporal Kareem nakui from Norco California staff sergeant Ryan now's 23 from Corryton Tennessee so we honor our dead we honor those that have fallen for our country we also as Leaders make sure we don't have to read names at a hearing and part of that is I'm concerned with um I'm concerned with what happened no doubt I spent 20 years in the military I'm a retired Navy Master Chief I spent five years in Iraq and Afghanistan like many of us in this room Afghanistan is very personal to us I grew up there like a lot of us who spent time there but I'm also a Navy Navy Master Chief I don't believe in excuses I believe in results and I'm focused it's an absolute tragic tragedy what happened we also have soldiers Sailors amarons and Marines in Syria in Iraq and throughout the world we're going to continue to fight these War these wars there are going to be times when we have withdrawals it's the way the world works so we have to learn from what happened to to make sure that we don't read more names when we withdraw from pick a place part of that is you Gentlemen please continue to tell your story complete continue to be an advocacy in this group uh in this in this sphere so that way we can prevent future incidents from occurring it's also on us as legislators to do our part and make sure those are held accountable and we are prepared in every form or fashion so I just wanted to spend my time honoring those that have fallen and also mention it is our responsibility to make sure that that the next conflict the current conflict we don't have the same debacles that we have the fact that we I had to read 13 names clearly shows that there's an issue there's an issue there but once again less about less about excuses more about results and it's going to be the warrior class that determines that we we fight through the politics in this all thank you gentlemen and I yield back chairman I yield back thank you Mr Gonzalez we're now going to yield to Mr Nunn for five minutes thank you Mr chair I appreciate that Mr Mass thank you Mr chair thank you very much for the families who are here first and foremost to those of you who were the final Safeguard the breach if you will that stood the line and helped evacuate as many as Americans our allies and our friends who it's been decades serving with us this nation owes you a grant a debt of gratitude you know I've flown more missions over Iraq and Afghanistan than I care to remember but the reality is is that whether you're the command pilot or whether you're that first term Airman who's just operating a sign box on the back of a Recon plane when you land you all do an after action and you're all equals you all have the opportunity to decide what worked and what did not work today you are the front line and perhaps the only that we are hearing out of the administration on what that after action looks like for the withdrawal of Afghanistan I don't think any of us should have to look back and think that what happened in August should ever happen to any of our sons daughters brothers or combat allies ever again when President Biden said this will be no Afghanistan or this will be no Vietnam this would be no helicopters lifting off buildings he was absolutely correct it was far worse we had an Afghan government caught completely by surprise by the lack of information provided we had a U.S government that chose as you've highlighted today selective intelligence to share not only with our allies not only with our five eyes our closest partners for the men and women who are on the front line men and women like Corporal Deacon Paige from my district a young Marine one of 13 whose family now stands as gold star families because he gave the ultimate sacrifice charged with defending Abigail deciding who got to live and who got left behind he was provided critical Intel gaps arguably selectively by an Administration who wanted to drive a timeline based on a calendar date not by facts on the ground he gave his life his family is proud We Are honored and so many Americans live today because of his sacrifice and the sacrifice of so many other families like that to you we can never salute you enough but we stand here in the breach so this does not happen again Friends when the helicopters left Afghanistan it saved maybe their president but so many more Afghan allies fell off the tread tires of c-17s leaving H Kaya something that arguably could have been avoided and so in today's testimony I'd like to go into detail here on how we got to a point where we abandoned Bagram Air Force Base Colonel I'm going to start with you do you believe the top Pentagon brass such as Austin Millie Miller McKinsey could have and should have done more to push back against President Biden after we rejected their advice to leave a residual true presence of 2500 in Afghanistan primarily protecting Bagram I've thought a lot about this question and I've gone back and forth on it they I can speak for the military leadership they were in a very difficult position where they gave the president their best course of action recommendation and it was not chosen and they have a decision at that point do you continue to follow what the president said or do you step away I commend them for holding the line because we would have still done it and they were in the best position to try to do it as responsible as we can in the very strict guard rails that were put on that course of action and they had to be the face of it which I don't think was fair but they were man enough to stand up there and look right down the barrel of the camera as things fell apart and give some responsibility for something they didn't recommend understood so let me ask the next question what would have been the impact if the United States had been able to keep Bagram and not been committed to an artificial deadline but shared the Intelligence on the ground of the real threat and been able to get more Americans more allies and ultimately protect Bagram Air Force Base so that we could have the evacuation that could have resulted in success rather than failure Colonel for you I can only guess because that's not what happened but I know that we would have had more space and time to be able to try to set the conditions for Afghan allies to get their feet set for what was coming it wouldn't have been this immediate rip out that left them looking where did we go in the middle of the fighting season they would have had a chance I'm not saying the outcome would have changed I don't know that there's no way that I could read the Tea Leaves of the future if it had gone the other way but we did when we didn't give them a chance then we damned them to exactly what happened Command Sergeant Major Smith I understand that you have delayed your deployment to centcom so that you could be here today it is both admirable and greatly appreciated you highlighted the fact that by transitioning out of Bagram we left a well-defended base with thousands of troops to be able to support and defend a rear guard action in the face of what was known to be an Insurgent Taliban force that in any day could march on the capital but instead you and your team were part of as you noted just over a hundred infantrymen and Marines defending an International Airport Under Siege from all sides in your testimony you cited that the site selection team by U.S state Department raised a personal comfort as a consideration of whether to use Bagram could you please elaborate that on that specifically did State Department give the impression that they were reluctant to move Embassy officials there because the space was let's say less comfortable at a military base like Bagram sir that's a correct indication yes is it your further belief that state department made choices that were most convenient for State Department officials rather than Mission essential items evacuating U.S Personnel the destruction of classified information and sensitive items going forward sirs I'm not privy to the decision-making process that occurred at the embassy I cannot fully answer that question thank you Mr chair I would like to just end with an appreciation for those who have served including those who continue to serve as so many on this committee have stood up to be able to stand in the breach with you including our own team in task force Argo that evacuated over 3 000 Americans and our allies by civilian airline with no help from the U.S state Department this after action is the only Insight we have into what's happening and while I praise you for being here there are men far above your station that should be in this room justifying their actions today so they can never happen again with that Mr chair I thank you and I see my time back thank you Mr Nunn for your service thank you for your questions I would just say right now I see something happening that I've actually never seen here before and it makes me proud and it is I have colleagues that are sitting down there with our service members and with gold star families just to let them know that they're not sitting above them they're not detached from them but that they're with them and they were part of the same fight and and chewed the same dirt in a sense and and showing that connectivity and honestly I've never seen it before in my time in Congress and it makes me proud to see that I'll say that very very truly it makes me proud to see it we have one other two more individuals Mr Van Orden and then I have myself yet but Mr van Norton I yield you five minutes thank you Mr chairman um I want to thank all you guys to be here or for being here I appreciate it command sergeant major uh rock on dude take care of the boys when you get overseas and girls um I appreciate your efforts uh my personal history with Afghanistan I didn't get there until 2003 for my first tour I held one of my friends hands as he died in the old cache when it was a tent we had a satellite phone next to his ear listening to his wife uh cry out to him and to God because she knew that she'd never see her husband alive again um when this started happening I could not sleep my wife told me just to go back to Afghanistan so I linked up with one of the groups we referred to in your testimony and I wound up in Abu Dhabi in Dubai processing people that civilians extracted with the help of a foreign government because our government willfully and knowingly abandoned American citizens and our allies to terrorists so I got a couple questions for you guys was there a written plan for this exfiltration colonel I did not see a written plan for the exfiltration for this specific Mission I'm sure the order is given though right reading through here you're planning and act you're building an airplane flight okay we had x amount of years to figure this out everybody from the Biden Administration says their hands were tied because the Doha agreement so they should have known that something was happening and when I say the Biden Administration I mean secretary blanken uh General Austin now sectef and general Millie they are all culpable in the deaths of all of these people because they are incapable of doing their jobs everybody I'm a retired Navy SEAL sorry I should have thrown that out there so I understand that NEOS are the purview of the state department and they waited so long to turn this Neo authority over to the dod to activate it they're responsible for all these people's deaths that is a fact um have any of you in your vast military experience ever heard of a plan where you would intentionally withdraw all the military forces that are protecting civilians out before you would pull the civilians up anybody no Colonel other Colonel rather the Douglas MacArthur said that every military disaster can be described in two words too late very well that's our major no sir okay um why did the Biden Administration in your opinion command sergeant major I will not ask you this question why in your opinion did the Biden Administration continue to lie about the number of American citizens that they willfully abandoned to terrorists in Afghanistan I couldn't even begin to speculate are you willing to accept the fact that the Biden Administration kept moving the ball and lying about the amount of American citizens they abandoned to terrorists in Afghanistan knowingly and willingly I'll say that the statements that came out from the administration did not match the fact that we were clearly seeing on the ground okay Colonel I was very troubled that I believe 90 percent of the evacuees were not people who had served worked were not Afghans who had worked for the US government or the U.S military I've got um interpreters who are still on the ground that we're trying to get their sivs trying to get them out and the fact that this withdrawal often was the withdrawal of the well-connected and not the people who are SIV holders I think deserves serious examination very well thank you Colonel uh how many of our native allies that have been fighting this fight for a long time since 2003 when the lithuanians were trying to get into NATO how many of our NATO allies wanted to uh follow this timeline and get out of Afghanistan on the arbitrary timeline that the Biden Administration set how many of our NATO allies wanted to go on that timeline to the best of your knowledge colonel none that I know of Colonel I'm not privy to that okay I am the answer is zero nobody wanted to leave from NATO this has been a NATO fight for a very long period of time and you guys didn't even address this so this would have fractured NATO it's unbelievably irresponsible that the Biden Administration would completely blow off all of our NATO allies none of them wanted to leave and then everybody quotes that we'd have 2500 U.S forces in the country that's not enough that's not true there would have been 10 to 12 000 forces of multi uh multi-cultural excuse me a multi it would have been an mnd again so combined joint Special Operations task force that I was with we would have the same thing cjtf 180 all the guys your 10th Mountain it would have been the same type of thing so they're lying and here's the most important question I can ask anybody here who has been fired for this no one Colonel to your knowledge uh no one that I know of okay so this is the most disgraceful thing that I can think of that the United States government has ever done in our entire history and zero people have been held accountable from the Biden Administration zero right how about the military writ large zero who was the Ground Force Commander what's he doing now you guys know do you do you know who it was yeah Admiral Weasley and then it was General Donahue I will say in their defense they were given an impossible situation and they showed extraordinary leadership when the every single aspect of what was going on turned into total chaos for things that were outside of their control I get it Senator Tom Cotton when he was questioning uh General milley asked him one thing he said why have you not resigned yet and general milley said he thought it would be a profoundly political statement I wish it my friend Tom Cotton who I respect gratefully did one more follow-up question General milley if intentionally abandoning American citizens and our allies to terrorists many of them to certain death is not worth making a political statement what in your estimation General Millie is none of these people that are there and we're giving them passes I'm not these General officers and flag officers should have resigned on the spot gone on television and said this is wrong you know what that takes that takes courage we have so many things wrong with our military at the senior levels and in the Biden Administration it's embarrassing these people I'm calling for them to resign General merely should not have a retirement he should not General Austin should be I don't know what that you should be doing but he sure as hell should not be leading our military he's a disgrace Mr chairman I appreciate you allowing me to speak my piece here and I yield back thank you for joining us today Mr Bernard and now recognize myself for five minutes I've heard a lot of things today I appreciate every bit of what I've heard I appreciate you all offering us your candor and your honesty and I'd ask that you bear with me for a couple more minutes of questioning I want to talk about the sivs the planning the operations as we've done in large when I think about planning I think about you come up with an objective that you want to meet and after you have an objective that you want you come up with a strategy and tactics by which you think you're going to accomplish that objective and then you do something really important you practice it so you can see what goes right and what goes wrong how things play out when the metal hits the meat as they say let me start with a broad question Colonel crumrick to your knowledge what level of practice took place is a very general question to the whole of the the withdraw to your knowledge what level of practice took place there is no time when the order was given to start withdrawing when the announcement came out on the 14th of April one may we sell water rolling basically suck down the drain from all those ad stations in Afghanistan were coming back to do an extraordinarily difficult task there was no time to be able to go through a full rehearsal it had to happen now so let me ask some of the specifics on this was it then not practiced if a a suicide bomber uh person a vehicle-born IED something else went off at one of the the access points units have that already baked into what they do for their battle drills for their standing operating procedures one of the reasons the speed was so important with the withdrawal from a planning perspective was to try to limit the exposure area for our service members that would be frankly vulnerable during the time period of withdrawal the reason I ask about practice for that sergeant major you brought up that you were looking at the level of services that were available at Bagram versus H Kaya and you mentioned that the the level of service there was maybe a level two Hospital in your opinion did it matter that it was a level two medical facility and not a level three medical facility sir if one of my soldiers were to get wounded I would want a level three there why for the greater life-saving ability let me ask some more planning and practice questions was it ever practiced that there would be thousands evacuated on civilian flights that pulled cash out of their wallet and flew Halfway Around the World to get people out of what was effectively a still a a standing war zone Colonel Chrome no was it practice that an Airfield could be overrun by a thousand people no not in this situation it's anybody's knowledge or overrun by 10 000 people sir I can speak on the back I've done the behalf of Bagram that was practiced my problem that that was a scenario that was exercised continually and you offered analysis based on you practice this at Bagram but what with h Kaya so I don't know I I am not privy to uh to what happened at H Kaya
