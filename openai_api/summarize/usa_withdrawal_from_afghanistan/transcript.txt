some that are with us in the audience
today
I want to begin by recognizing
Christy shamblin if you wouldn't mind
standing we'd love for everybody to see
a
mother-in-law of Sergeant Nicole G
lost at the Abbey gate
Alicia Lopez
the mother of
Corporal Hunter Lopez
killed in action at the Abbey gate
Coral racino
and Alan Doolittle
parents of Corporal Humberto Sanchez
also killed in action at the Abbey gate
thank you for joining us today
thank you for raising Patriots
and I'm sorry for your loss
I'm now going to
recognize myself for an opening
statement
I'm not going to begin by belaboring any
points
the president's withdrawal was a
complete and utter catastrophe
the images of people hanging off of
planes and desperate parents handing
their babies over the airport walls to
soldiers are seared into our country's
Collective conscience
yesterday every member of this Committee
in this room Republican and Democrat
voted to require the state department to
come up with a plan for reimbursing the
numerous outside groups who had to get
involved to rescue Americans from
Afghanistan
I can guarantee that private citizens
flying seven thousand miles across the
world to rescue Americans and those that
worked alongside America for 20 years
was not a product of the state
Department's good planning and order
that was a product of chaos and a
failure to plan
and we have witnesses here today that
will be able to give specific pictures
of what was happening on the ground that
will be clearer and more accurate
than any news report that I've seen and
frankly I believe that's because the
White House and its mouthpieces were
lying to the American people as they
were narrating what was taking place
during the withdrawal of Afghanistan
I have no doubt that your eyewitness
testimonies will demonstrate a clear
failure to predict or plan for the worst
case scenarios as we do when we plan
military operations I'm grateful to each
of you for appearing here today command
sergeant major Jake Smith specifically
is here in his personal capacity he is
an active duty service member and so I
would ask members of the committee to
refrain from engaging him in political
questions
the purpose of today's hearing is to
examine the failure to plan and the
major repercussions that it had on
diplomatic efforts and National Security
this Administration said time and time
again that Afghanistan was not a war
that could be won militarily that's the
administration's words it could only be
one diplomatically
if this could only be won diplomatically
then there is no other conclusion then
the withdrawal was a complete and total
loss
because that is when we lost all
diplomatic options the literal failure
to plan was completely completely erased
the potential for on-the-ground
diplomacy and created a black eye for
the United States standing abroad and
National Security at home I'm going to
say this I wrote black guy in my
comments when I wrote this this isn't a
black guy it
black guy does not come close
to constituting what took place what it
is for America with the draw withdraw of
Afghanistan I don't I don't know the
appropriate word to say what exactly
that is but it's black eye is not the
right one
in the words of the administration
spokesperson Jennifer saki the
mouthpiece the president asked for a
review from his National Security team
he asked them not to sugarcoat it and he
was provided with a clear-eyed
assessment about the best path forward
these are the words of Jennifer sake she
said that the president was the ultimate
decision maker he was the decision maker
who chose September 11th as the initial
drawdown date he was the decision maker
who pulled the people with the guns out
before the people without the guns the
decision maker who collapsed the
operations at age to H Kaya airport it
was President Joe Biden the ultimate
decision maker he decided to to make the
decisions and none of those decisions in
that process of the withdrawal they
weren't made in the Doha agreement
that's not when they were made they were
made by the ultimate decision maker Joe
Biden
Americans asked after the withdrawal how
could the intelligence have gotten it so
wrong
but I find it to be clearer each and
every day that the intelligence didn't
get it as wrong as Americans thought it
was the ultimate decision maker that was
refusing to listen to the Intelligence
being given again in the words of the
White House spokesperson Jennifer sake
the president believes there is not a
military solution this will require a
diplomatic solution she said that the
president was clear from the beginning
that we anticipated and planned to have
a diplomatic presence on the ground
moving forward
why then did we see a repeat of Saigon
with diplomatic Personnel being
evacuated off of the roof of an embassy
though that is exactly what President
Biden said would never happen
it's because of a failure to plan for
Murphy a failure to plan for a situation
when things don't go exactly perfect
exactly as you plan the basic military a
failure to plan meant that the security
of diplomatic Personnel could not be
guaranteed and as a result there's no
diplomatic presence on the ground today
again in the words of the administration
spokesperson Jennifer saki the United
States will retain significant assets in
the region as the president talked about
Over the Horizon capabilities to counter
the potential re-emergence of the
terrorist threat that's garbage
any Over the Horizon capabilities that
we had to deal with terrorist threats
were wiped out almost immediately and it
has only gotten worse from the onset of
the withdrawn the decision to abandon
Bagram Airfield our capabilities were
diminished in our security deteriorated
The Abbey gate bomber was a member of
Isis K who had just been released from
the Bagram prison
now in the two years since
Afghanistan has essentially become a
Club Med for terrorists Isis is using it
as a training ground though fighting
with the Taliban the Taliban is sending
welfare payments to Al-Qaeda Fighters
there are no Over the Horizon
capabilities to deal with that it's the
opposite our adversaries are literally
gaining a foothold there just three
months ago leaders from Iran Russia
China they met Uzbekistan to discuss
what they called quote Regional
Solutions rather than Western
interference in Afghanistan
our Witnesses here today will be able to
speak to the situation on the ground
and that the failure to plan wiped out
any possibility of what the
administration said had to be the
victory that was diplomatic efforts
as a direct result
of in my opinion a failure to plan not
bad luck
bad planning
America Mourns 13 of its sons and
daughters
we have families sitting in our audience
who mourn the loss of their sons and
daughters
I've had numerous conversations with the
families
and what I've extracted from those
conversations is there's nothing that
can bring back anybody's children my
colleague we've lost friends you all
have lost friends there's nothing that
can bring back anybody that we've lost
we look for Solace and how we don't
repeat the mistakes of the past
that's
to be frank that's what I've heard from
the families how do we make sure that
something like this never happens again
so we're trying to learn so that we
don't repeat those past mistakes
but from where I see it those that made
the mistakes
are still in the exact same positions
today
or they've advanced
in the positions that they hold
and they are now trying to rewrite
history
in order to Tout The withdraw of
Afghanistan as a success
and what that tells me
is that as of right now
they haven't learned a thing
I'm now going to recognize my colleague
ranking member Crow the gentleman from
Colorado
for any opening statement that you may
have
thank you chairman mast
let me Begin by
um joining the chairman in recognizing
the gold star families Ms shamblin Ms
Lopez Ms Racino Mr Doolittle
our our country owes you a debt of
gratitude that frankly we will never be
able to repay
your families have made the greatest
sacrifice that any family
can make for this nation
and we owe you a debt of gratitude that
even though we can't repay we must
attempt to do so by conducting ourselves
in a in a way that is worthy of the
sacrifice
of your children
and that requires honesty requires
Candor it requires giving answers
and that's what I will endeavor to do
with my colleagues here in a
non-partisan way because that's what you
deserve
um also I want to recognize Command
Sergeant Major Smith
in the category of it's a very very
small world I was a commander sergeant
major Smith's platoon leader in the
second ranger battalion uh where uh we
did multiple Afghanistan rotations
during that time so Command Sergeant
mayor Smith it's it's really great to
see you
all the way
um
I I do want to say I mean this is an
incredibly emotionally a Charged issue
as it should be because the consequences
were so high and so catastrophic for so
many people
but to do this right
and you know I'm not reading off of
prescription remarks here I'm just kind
of speaking from the heart frankly
um to do this right in my view requires
uh honesty and and Candor as I mentioned
earlier uh and you know my critiques of
the withdrawal my criticism of the
withdrawal are lengthy and actually well
documented it was I was very clear uh in
uh 2021 that I did not think it went the
way it should have been that there were
a lot of missteps there were a lot of
problems and we do owe it to uh the
Fallen we do owe it to America we owe to
the taxpayers that spent tens of
billions of dollars uh the over 3 000
people that gave their lives in
Afghanistan all of them to actually have
an honest accounting of that
but I also want to make it clear that
my goal here is that the story of
Afghanistan is not the story just of
August of 2021. that's not the whole
story right and that's not to to Pivot
away from having an honest assessment of
that month in that withdrawal because we
have to have that and the American
people deserve that
but
we have to broaden the aperture
right this was a 20-year War this was
America's longest war
right multiple generations of Americans
fought in this war and sacrificed and
gave for it four presidencies
were responsible for this war ten
congresses were responsible for this war
and frankly honestly before August of
2021 you asked most members of Congress
to find Afghanistan on a map and they
couldn't
right and there's awful lot of Monday
morning quarterbacking now and people
sitting back and saying that they they
knew what should have happened this is
what should have happened and you know
having all sorts of opinions where for
years nobody even paid attention to it
which I know frustrated us right to no
end all my fellow Veterans as we as we
talked and worked on this and said this
was moving in a bad direction for a long
time
and nobody was listening and paying
attention to it so that's the history in
the context and I hope that we can have
a hearing today that addresses elements
of the withdrawal that learns important
lessons to make sure that we don't
repeat the mistakes of the past but that
we also provide context we also
understand that there were there's a
long history here in in August 2021 just
didn't happen on its own that there are
years in a lot of things that led us to
that moment that are a part of this
story here that we have to have an
honest accounting of so that's my goal
and I look forward to the conversation
today I yield back
thank you Mr Crowe and I'm pleased to
have the chairman of the full committee
chairman McCall with us and I recognize
you for as much time as you may consume
for an opening statement thank you Mr
chairman for that generous
recognition I want to thank both of you
for your service in the Afghanistan war
Mr chairman ranking member
um
I remember traveling as a member
spending days and you're spending years
and we got a little snapshot of what was
going on but you were on the ground
fighting and Mr chairman you know your
loss of Limbs of sacrifice the that both
of you made but Mr chairman
particularly you does not go unnoticed
by this committee or me
as a chairman of the full committee and
I just want to thank you
for your service and I want to thank the
gold star families it's good to see you
again we had a very nice visit last week
you know Christy shamlin the mother in
law of Sergeant Nicole G
Alicia Lopez mother of Corporal Hunter
Lopez
I used by the way Hunter's pen to sign
my subpoena for the after action report
from the state department that is still
yet to be complied with
and Alan Doolittle and coral brazino the
parents of Corporal Sanchez thank you
and the witnesses for your moral courage
to come here today to speak the truth
about what happened and to the ranking
member I agree there are many mistakes
made in the 20 years but
the ultimate mistake ended
20 years of blood and treasure
with now the towel being in charge
raising their flag over our Embassy
taking seven billion dollars of our
weapons leaving the women behind under
Sharia law now where they can't even go
outside I was with the ambassador of
Afghanistan
Roy Romani had dinner with her last
night
and we talked about what happened
what how it was stabilized and then it
went into chaos because one man made the
decision and that is the
commander-in-chief
and the buck stops here as Harry Truman
would say so let's own it
and take responsibility and not try to
kick it down or go back in time and say
it was someone else's fault true leaders
own mistakes
and this was a mistake of epic
proportions
this unconditional I withdrawal I call
it an unconditional surrender
to the Taliban who now have taken over
Afghanistan
and what's really sad especially when we
examine the Abbey gate and we heard from
sergeant
Tyler
Andrew Vargas about the fact that it
could have been prevented
in many cases that is the hardest thing
I know for the families to accept
and I was there we were there for the
briefings from state from DOD and the IC
and for months President Biden ignored
warnings from his own generals
and his own intelligence community and
bipartisan members of Congress
about what was happening on the ground
as the narrative didn't fit what was
happening on the ground coming out of
the White House as the chairman so
eloquently went through
whether it was his spokespersons to him
himself about what was happening it was
like a blind eye
the
result of this committee's oversight so
far we did get access to The Descent
cable
from the employees at the embassy they
were telling the story about what was
happening they were the ones who said Mr
President it's going to happen fast
they predict by September 1st they got
pretty close
and they said we're not prepared
and you need to prepare for this there's
an old adage if you've failed to plan
you plan to fail
this was a complete failure because we
didn't have a plan of action
and what they said was disturbing
because it predicted exactly what was
going to happen
if we didn't act fast
and yet even with that warning President
Biden and secretary blinken failed to
change course to the very end
rather than prioritizing U.S national
security and the safety of thousands of
Americans they forced this rapid
withdrawal of U.S troops from
Afghanistan on an artificial timeline I
remember it's going to be September the
11th what an insult to the victims of 9
11 that was going to happen on 9 11. we
all know they stopped fighting in the
wintertime why wouldn't you why wouldn't
you plan it at a time that made sense
and then the shutdown of Bagram Air Base
our ISR crown jewels to see Russia China
and Iran and the terrorists in the
region was shut down in the dead of
night
it was not driven by National Security
it was driven by politics
you know the idea that you're going to
drop troop levels to 650 service members
to do this
is insane
and once we abandoned Bagram I'm sure
we'll hear this from
Jacob Smith
you know 12
000 prisoners
are released into Afghanistan Isis cave
the suicide bomber released from Bagram
seven billion dollars of equipment left
behind and now they're selling it to our
adversaries and to terrorist Nations
and yet we made zero
seems to me very little attempts to get
the men and women who fought alongside
U.S servicemen out of that country to
safety
and our partners our interpreters are
now left behind to be hunted down by the
Taliban with a very Biometrics that we
created and now they can go door to door
to get a fingerprint to confirm if they
worked with the United States
and then they're executed
to me it's sad
that after 20 years of blood and
treasure where are we now with the women
the Taliban in control
the geopolitical
issues that face you know China now is
there for God's sakes
and the lithium
China will probably get access to Bagram
it's hard for me to tell the veterans
that
and the suicide rate is so high
and to them I tell them it was worth it
because you made this country safe for
20 years I chaired the homeland security
committee we stopped a lot of external
operations to kill Americans it's
because
men and women like these two and your
sons and daughters were there
getting that intelligence to make this
country
safe so I wanted to again
thank the families for being here
I can't imagine the grief that you have
but I can tell you that we are going to
hold that we're going to uncover what
happened
we're going to uncover transparency and
accountability is
very important to me and I think to all
members of this committee and we want
accountability
and I will not rest until we get that
and I promise you that while the
president wants to sweep this under the
rug that I will never forget what
happened and I will hold people
accountable
and we will on this committee ensure
that something like this never
ever happens again
in the United States of America the
greatest country
in the world
so I want to thank the chairman for
holding this hearing with that I yield
back thank you chairman McCall
a little bit of procedure that we have
to do here gentlemen first of all I ask
unanimous consent that the following
members be allowed to sit on the dice

thank you for being here today your full
statements will be made a part of the
record and I'll ask each of you to keep
your spoken remarks to roughly five
minutes to ensure all members have time
for questions I now recognize Colonel
kromrick for your opening statement
good morning
I want to start by thanking chairman
McColl chairman Mast ranking member
Meeks ranking member Crow and the
members of the committee and
subcommittee I also want to pass a
special thanks to the members of the
committee who served in Afghanistan
and a special thanks to the gold star
family members that are here in
attendance today
I appreciate your invitation to speak
today
my goal or the goal of my testimony is
to help the committee understand how the
administration and the military's
planning process functioned throughout
Afghanistan's withdrawal and illuminate
the points of failure that Doom the
effort
we're all painfully aware of the
terrible Optics of our departure and the
utter failure in Afghanistan My Hope Is
this testimony provides Clarity
highlighting what worked what failed and
how we can avoid making the same
mistakes in the future
it's important to acknowledge our three
strategic objectives and end States for
the withdrawal the first was to maintain
an ongoing diplomatic presence the
second was to support Afghan Security
Forces people and the government and the
third was prevent Afghanistan from once
again becoming a safe haven for
terrorism we were not successful
I'll separate our planning efforts into
two categories first strategic decision
failures and second the planning process
and its effect on Mission execution
four critical strategic decision
failures set the conditions in the
environment from the entire withdrawal
first failure to follow the Doha
agreement fundamental to our Doha
agreement were seven conditions that the
Taliban had to meet that would trigger
our full withdrawal from Afghanistan an
agreement only works if both sides
participate the Taliban failed six of
seven conditions example one key
provision was the reduction of Violence
by both sides we greatly curtailed our
air support to the Afghan forces
weakening their offensive capability
while the Taliban increased their
attacks by up to 70 percent
yet we still began our withdrawal giving
no incentive for the Taliban to follow
any of the Doha agreement provisions
therefore both sides failed
the Taliban to follow the basics of the
agreement and we failed to enforce the
agreement
the statement we held up our end of the
bargain Rings Hollow and naive when our
duplicitous partner never tried or
intended to support the agreement
second selective intelligence blindness
senior decision makers rely heavily on
intelligence to make the right decision
both for what to do and when to do it
the Trap decision makers fall into is
selectively choosing intelligence to
support their favorite course of action
rather than letting the intelligence and
inform and shape their decisions
a five-month full retrograde operation
with a transition of power to a
questionable Afghan government only
makes sense if you believe the Taliban
will not threaten the outcome and the
Afghan government is ready to lead
the administration made that
determination based on intelligence that
overestimated the Afghan government's
capabilities and wished away the
taliban's capabilities
there is very little Intel evidence to
suggest that the Biden administration's
plan would work and a mountain range of
evidence
to suggest the plan would fail
General milley General Miller and
general McKenzie all recommended not
withdrawing until the Doha agreement
conditions were met
these seasoned experts were ignored and
the best case scenario plan to withdraw
immediately started the domino effect to
catastrophe
third bad timing the withdrawal window
made of September of 21 was planned
during the peak of the well-known Afghan
fighting season the Taliban were at
their strongest most aggressive and
logistically capable during this time
period
why would we leave fragile Afghan
governments vulnerable to the taliban's
strongest advantage
why did the tactically meaningless
20-year anniversary of 9 11 Drive the
timeline
ripping out U.S military support with
little to no warning at the height of
December fighting season led to
disastrous results
with the aggressive Taliban on the March
the U.N reported Afghanistan suffered
its highest civilian casualty count on
record
not because of international military
action but because of Afghan on Afghan
violence
and number four limited time for DOD and
interagency to fully plan and execute
the withdrawal Mission and the
subsequent and separate Neo mission
the military has a planning Maxim
one third time to plan two-thirds time
to rehearse before we execute the
operation
there was no time for traditional
military planning to include looking at
worst case scenarios in real detail
to meet the 11th September timeline we
had to plan immediately and execute now
Prudence in patients were replaced by
speed of action without the time to
study the consequences and mitigate
those risks
shifting to the plan the bottom line is
the administration controlled how we
withdrew and when we withdrew making
them the majority stakeholder of many
guilty parties in the failure and
collapse of Afghanistan in the current
Taliban rule
how the plan was chosen the new
Administration Administration discussed
options between February and April of 21
with the National Security Council u.s4a
and centcom offer their best experience
advice in the form of courses of action
that provided the administration
distinct options based on troop levels
timelines conditions and end States
the president's decision to ignore the
best military advice and execute an
immediate military withdrawal was a
shock and a rude awakening for all the
planners
there was a sense of dread and cynicism
based on the timeline and the enemy
threat
given the strict guidance centcom
executed a fast retrograde to provide
the best Force protection for our
service members reducing their exposure
to any potential enemy action
it was impressive in scope and scale
achieving success by mid-july
but the unintended consequence of an
unannounced and immediate departure of a
trusted Ally was the demoralizing impact
it had in Afghan units at the height of
the taliban's fighting season the
brittle Afghan military collapsed many
units quit those that stayed and fought
found their reinforcements resupply and
air support had abandoned them damning
them to be captured or executed by the
Taliban
I highly recommend watching the
documentary retrograde which captures
this horror first hand
the Neo by mid-july and the successful
withdrawal of our military the Taliban
tripled the number of districts they
controlled from 78 to over 200 of
Afghanistan's 419 districts and just two
months
they achieved irreversible momentum to
take Kandahar and ultimately Cobble in
the next month
while centcom was hyper focused on
executing the withdrawal the NSC level
tabletop exercises in DC lacked the
granular detail required to identify the
Achilles heel of the Neo the state
Department's broken special immigrant
Visa process that would directly lead to
the humanitarian crisis at the hkiah
gates
again our military executed an
unprecedented airlift of over a hundred
twenty thousand U.S citizens and Visa
holders largest in U.S history however
the Afghan allies who plan to stay and
run the government could not secure a
visa to leave the country and were
trapped with their families at the
chaotic H Kyle walls
pop-up ad hoc groups like Pineapple
Express and the Afghan Evac and x-fill
network sprung up to help our Afghan
friends when our government failed and
abandoned our allies
I provide a first-hand account in my
written testimony of Brigadier General
Latif as families experience as an
example
looking at these decisions in total it
becomes clear our Hasty actions set the
conditions for the Afghan government's
collapse the Taliban slingshot to power
and the loss of 20 years of Hope and
progress in the Afghan people
in conclusion
fighting a war and establishing a
sovereign government means we have the
moral responsibility to end the conflict
and withdraw our military in a
deliberate and responsible manner we
failed the enemy rules Afghanistan
we owe our killed in action wounded in
action gold star family members combat
veterans their families our allies and
the current bill payers the men and
women still trapped in Afghanistan under
the heel of the Taliban especially the
women and the girls a full accounting of
our missteps and a commitment to never
let this happen again thank you for the
opportunity to speak today I look
forward to answering your questions
thank you Colonel comrick I now
recognize Colonel kolenda for your
opening statement
thank you so much for the opportunity
and the honor to be here and I also want
to recognize our gold star families and
uh
devastated by your loss of what happened
at the at the Abbey gate I know we're
talking about
a different date but July 27th which is
today is very uh important day for me
16 years ago today my unit was involved
in the biggest fire fight we had in the
450-day deployment
in Afghanistan hundreds of insurgent
Fighters attempted to trap one of our
units in a valley floor
in uh
nuristan Province Eastern neristan
Province or the border of Pakistan
staff sergeant Ryan fritchie while
reconordering a place to employ his
Squad against the enemy was shot and
killed
he was awarded the Bronze Star for Valor
and is buried outside of Indianapolis
Indiana and Hall Indiana
a few minutes later
Captain Tom Bostic now Major Tom Bostic
was
leading this company and his command
post came under overwhelming attack
he directed the members of his command
post to move to a different position
where they could could continue taking
the fight to the enemy Tom
single-handedly counter-attacked by fire
this large enemy Force he was killed by
a rocket-propelled grenade it's a boom I
still hear
he was awarded the distinguished service
cross
for his actions that day
we lost four more soldiers that Thomas
buried at Arlington gravesite 87-55 he's
originally from Llano Texas
we lost four other soldiers in that
450-day deployment
private first class Chris Pfeiffer
buried in Spaulding Nebraska
Sergeant Adrian hike buried in Carroll
Iowa
specialist Jacob Lowell who's buried at
the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery
outside of Chicago Illinois
and Captain Dave Boris who was who is
buried in Minersville Pennsylvania
watching the collapse of Afghanistan in
August of 20
21 and I had a number of emotions just
like everybody else here
I watched with sadness and horror at the
attack on Abby gate that cost 13 of our
service members lives
I was angry
we've been at this for 20 years we've
spent over two trillion dollars more
than 2 300 service members killed tens
of thousands with wounds both seen and
unseen
and it all came crashing down like a
house of cards
I was disgusted
disgusted knowing that Afghan military
commanders were creating ghost soldiers
so they could take their the pay
uh they were selling their soldiers food
Fuel and ammunition on the black market
as a part of the uh the kleptocracy that
had become the Afghan government
and to see the fact that Afghan senior
officials just seemed to
Take the Money and Run
and I was disappointed
disappointed that another war ended in
disaster
I mean Vietnam Iraq Afghanistan
you know one disaster
is a horrible accident
two disasters
is a tragic coincidence
three disasters
in these large-scale interventions
fighting insurgencies
is a disturbing Trend that suggests that
we are not learning from experience
in fact I wrote this book zero-sum
Victory what we're getting wrong about
war it looks at the three conflicts and
the
repeated errors The Chronic errors that
we make in each one at the policy and
strategy level that are increasing the
risk that these wars turn into disasters
you know in each case our troops fight
valiantly
they do exactly what they're told they
do it to a very high standard but too
often the policy and strategy
are not worthy of their sacrifice
and that's got to change
I agree that we have an opportunity not
to
repeat the mistakes of the past but if
we don't address these policy and
strategy errors that we continue making
then we are likely
to have a fourth disaster in our next
military major military intervention and
that I find totally unacceptable
in my written testimony I talk about
three of the immediate causes of the
collapse in Afghanistan
I also address some of the systemic
failures that are common to the three uh
recent Wars that I mentioned and also
some low-cost High payoff reforms that
we can make today
that reduce the risk of another disaster
while increasing the probability that
we're going to be successful in our next
conflict and I'll be delighted to take
questions about those uh in during a q a
thank you very much for the opportunity
thank you Colonel that
well you said very much stuck with me in
my mind too often the policy and
strategy are not worthy of their
sacrifice we need to make sure that it
always is always and I think we're all
United in that and I now recognize
Command Sergeant Major Smith for your
opening statement
members of the committee it's an honor
to be able to come here today and speak
before you and uh to the gold star
families it's an honor to be in your
presence it truly is
my name is Command Sergeant sergeant
major Jake Smith I use my rank and title
only to identify myself and my position
to speak on this matter
I tested by before before you not in His
official representative of the United
States Army but as a citizen
I must preface my testimony by making it
abundantly clear that I am not here to
place blame on any organization or
individual for the results of our
Nations and days in Afghanistan
it is not my place as a soldier to do so
it is merely my duty to present this
committee with the facts I know to be
true so that you may make a
well-informed decision
I want to make it known that I have
little insight into the overarching
strategic planning of the Afghanistan
withdrawal
by every area of expertise
comes from the Tactical planning and
execution of the closure of Bagram Air
Base
and the recommendations I made to
members of the U.S embassy in Kabul
regarding a non-combat combatant
evacuation
I will stick to the facts and
circumstances I personally personally
witnessed and offer minimal of personal
opinion
I very respectfully ask that any
questions you ask of me keep to the
facts of the matter and shy away from
any personal beliefs or opinions I may
hold
from October 11 2020 to 2 July 2021 I
served as the area support group of
Afghanistan or ASG command sergeant
major
the duties and responsibilities of ASG
included all base life support functions
for the remaining nine U.S military
installations in Afghanistan
these functions included billeting
dining facilities Public Works
Sanitation and emergency response
a particular importance to my testimony
is my understanding of the life support
capabilities of Bagram and H Kaya
in May 2021 I was given the additional
duty to serve as the Bagram senior
enlisted advisor
this Duty included the oversight of all
Force protection measures and entry
control points on Bagram
of particular importance to my testimony
was my understanding of the security
posture of Bagram and its capabilities
it was sometime in the spring that we
received the first tentative date to
work towards in finalizing our go to
zero effort September 11 2021.
the order came
to begin to close all the smaller bases
but two were left in question
Bagram and H Kaya
for those two installations there was a
looming a question of whether or not
they would close
part of General Miller's guidance was to
main order discipline and dignity as we
collapse
we would not just up and leave
we would hand over exceptionally orderly
bases to the Afghan government
we are instructed to get as small as we
could
but still function on the chance that
Bagram would be used in future efforts
this presented a significant issue to
Bagram as we could not collapse to the
point of inoperability
we would have to have the Personnel
vital to running power security and
sanitation
if we began to close the base
infrastructure too aggressively we would
not be able to function and maintain
Security on Bagram if it was to remain
open
it was sometime in March or April that I
first met with planners from the U.S
embassy
four planners came to Bagram to conduct
a site survey to determine if Bagram was
the appropriate spot to conduct a
non-combatant evacuation
in this conversation I was told that H
Kaya would be the other option
prior to this meeting I had reviewed the
contingency plan for a Neo that had been
created years prior
the contingency plan accounted for forty
five thousand to fifty thousand persons
that would need to be evacuated
it was members of the embassy team who
informed me that the actual number would
be anywhere from 120 000 to 140 000.
I advise the embassy team against using
H Kaya for the following reasons
Bagram could house 35 000 people without
overloading the infrastructure whereas H
Kaya could only hold roughly three
thousand
H Kyle was a shared Airfield it was not
completely controlled by the military it
had significant weak points in the
security
Bagram had a completely secure Airfield
that would require a massive military
offenses to overrunner breach
hko was surrounded by the the city of
Kabul and is 4.4 million residents
if there was to be a fight it would be
in an urban environment and
exceptionally difficult to undertaken
control
Bagram had a small town on the western
edge an open train in the majority of
the north east and west
movement of any kind could be detected
controlled or eliminated very early
the defend ability of Bagram was
exponentially that greater than that of
age Kaya
Bagram held the logistical capability to
meet the requirements of 130 000 people
Bagram had over 35 000 bed spaces and
could create more using cots within the
air Airfield hangers if necessary
Bagram had four dining facilities and
food that could have fed those fleeing
Bagram had tens of thousands of gallons
of potable water and on-site water for
purification capabilities H Kaya did not
Bagram had a rule 3 Hospital meaning
that it had the greatest life-saving
capability of any Hospital remaining in
Afghanistan
hkiah had a roll to hospital meaning
that it had a degraded capability to
that of Bagram
finally Bagram had four industrial size
incinerators
it had two industrial size material
shredders it had the mechanical
capability to destroy sensitive
equipment on an industrial scale in a
short amount of time
H Kaya did not
when I laid out all my points to the
site survey team they verbally agreed
with my assessment
I met twice more with this site survey
team once in May and once in June
in these meetings I required about the
offense of the Taliban had launched in
May and the increasing ground they
controlled I asked if Neo was going to
be held in Bagram due to the taliban's
rapid advance that indicated an assault
on Kabul
the team acknowledged the ground that
the Taliban had gained but offered
little insight as the to the
decision-making process at the embassy
honor about June 14th we were given the
order to close Bagram by July 4th
well short of the originally planned
date of September 11th
hkaya would remain open and provide a
quick reaction force to the Embassy
located approximately four driving miles
away
this was to be an enduring mission
all talks of conducting a Neo were
ceased
it is my understanding that those in the
embassy believe that the Taliban would
not advance to take a bull and a Neo was
unnecessary
I exited it as one of the final
conventional forces in Bagram
on 2 July 2021.
my thoughts stayed with the forces that
would stay on the ground as the Taliban
controlled about 50 percent of
Afghanistan on the day I Departed
one single U.S infantry company Charlie
Company 431 infantry 10th Mountain
division led by Captain Swayze Brown and
first sergeant Andrew Kelly
protected H Kaya for approximately six
weeks before things began to unravel in
mid-august
an area once protected by hundreds of
soldiers and contractors was now
protected by a hundred and thirteen
American soldiers and two companies of
our Turkish partner forces
approximately 430 other U.S service
members and Logistics maintenance air
defense and service roles also occupied
hkaya
this was the only Force left in
Afghanistan
I will offer this final bit of opinion
the mission asked of this company
and the subsequent Marines soldiers
Airmen Sailors and Coalition forces
called to reinforce the smallest
security contingent was monumental
the military executed this Mission and
the closure of Afghanistan with honor
integrity and dignity
there's no force in the world that have
executed such a chaotic and difficult
Mission better than our U.S and
Coalition forces did under the diarist
of circumstances
they were asked to control absolute
panic and Anarchy they somehow did it
I think every single one of them for our
sacrifice to our great nation
thank you for allowing me to speak here
today
thank you command sergeant major
we're now going to move to questions
I'm going to be Begin by recognizing
chairman of the full committee chairman
McCall for five minutes
chairman let me first again
acknowledge as a gold star families here
and I want to thank the three Witnesses
for your moral courage
and Clarity in your testimony here today
um
you know there's an old adage
if you plan if you fail to plan you're
planning to fail
Benjamin Franklin
first chairman of this committee
Continental Congress he was right
there was no plan
if you fail to plan you plan to fail
we have uncovered that there was
a request that came from the state
department
to the defense department for an
evacuation plan
however that came on August 17th two
days after the fall of Afghanistan the
fall of Kabul four days after our
Embassy was evacuated
and yet the President says we're planned
for all contingencies I think Colonel
krummick you eloquently talked about how
he recklessly disregarded his own
National Security Council his own
generals and the intelligence community
that we were being briefed at the same
time
well we saw this Rosy narrative by state
and that this dire Warning by the rest
the dod in the intelligence community
and the result was this complete debacle
and failure
so Colonel chronic my first question is
is to you
was there a plan have did you ever see
an evacuation plan
thank you for the question uh
chairman the way the process works for
planning is we'll get an initial
guidance that we need to come up with
courses of action
so centcom u.s4a built a number of
courses of action that were very
different they they were very unique in
each
um you know characteristics of each one
it could be timeline it could be
conditions troop levels and then the
senior military members could you pull
that microphone a little bit closer
thank you thank you
so the senior commanders then will pick
one and give them a recommendation and
explain why that is now feeding into
this is also the intelligence community
so this is part operations part
intelligence and they'll lay out hey
this is the plan we think we should take
and in this case
General milley General Miller General
McKenzie all recommended we should not
do the withdrawal until conditions are
met because violence had risen in
Afghanistan and their concern was the
timing is wrong this isn't going to give
our
um our allies a chance
to be able to react accordingly to the
Taliban offensive so in the two minutes
I I just want to drill this down because
sure yeah there was a recommendation and
you talked about the failure to meet the
Doha agreement but the president
disregarded that ignored that he
disregarded the advice of his his DOD
and IC and National Security Council
was there ever an evacuation plan did
you see I know there's discussions did
you ever see an evacuation plan
I did not the discussions were going on
at this high level
the problem was those that would need to
actually plan and rehearse it were
extremely busy I think sergeant major
captured it eloquently of how busy and
how few service members we had on the
ground they were not in a position to be
able to plan and rehearse now we've
issued several subpoena I have not seen
an evacuation plan
if they had it I think they would have
produced it to this committee
and this led to the chaos
who was in charge
you know we heard Sergeant Tyler Vargas
Andrew testify that he had the suicide
bomber in his sights but they didn't
know what the rules of engagement were
for God's sakes
I mean
there's no plan
there is there are you know Rules of
Engagement are confusing at best
they don't know what they are
did you know what the rules of
engagement were
I was not in the ground so I can't speak
to the specific Rules of Engagement I
know the military had a clear leadership
position of who was in charge on the
ground what was lacking from my
perspective was the Department of State
leadership on the ground when I asked
who was in charge you know if if you
have an evacuation plan state takes over
the evacuation correct prior to that the
dod is in charge but nobody knows he was
really in charge because there's no plan
in place and guess what the talbian
takes over my last question
The Rules of Engagement are you know
confusing at best you have mentioned a
defensive strike would be a rule of
Engagement if you saw a description of
the suicide bomber along with your
sniper team who confirmed this is the
suicide bomber
were the Rules of Engagement provide
that you could take out the threat as a
defensive strike
if I saw the suicide bomber and I saw
the threat I would absolutely kill that
suicide bomber and yet when he contacted
his commanding officer who we're going
to interview he says I don't have that
Authority and they ask who does have
that Authority he goes I don't know I'll
have to get back to you and then the
interim time guess what
the bomb goes off killing
13 service men and women 160 Afghans
injury 45 additionals U.S servicemen and
women massive
because one man says you don't have
permission to engage we're going to
follow up on that chain but I think it
all results because there's confusion on
the ground nobody knows what the plan
and nobody knows who is in charge yes
sir
so if I could just build on that I think
the point that you're making that
there's nobody in charge is exactly
right there's nobody functionally in
charge of our Wars on the ground in
theater so what happens if I could just
draw a quick um quick picture
is we deploy to combat zones in
bureaucratic silos so you've got the
you've got the president and then
National Security Council beneath them
of course and then you've got these
different bureaucratic silos so it could
be uh DOD
state
Aid uh the IC with their different silos
and
there's nobody
in charge of this group on the ground
and had there been somebody in charge of
this group on the ground then what you
would have seen is a plan that not only
synchronized the military withdrawal but
also the evacuation so until we get this
problem fixed we actually have somebody
in charge on the ground of our Wars
we're going to continue to have high
risk of these kind of disasters I agree
and by law they're required to come up
with a plan and they did not and that's
the point the Chairman's made over and
over and I thank you for indulging me
thank you chairman thank you for your
responses ranking member crows now
recognized for five minutes
thank you chairman and thank you all for
your your testimony and opening I just
wanted to provide a little bit of
context here and I'm going to ask a few
quick questions starting with both the
colonel Chrome rich and colonel kolinda
from 2016 to 2021 are you aware that the
Taliban had increased its control of
territory every year for those
consecutive five years colonel carmich
yes Colonel Kalinda yes absolutely are
you aware of any indications in that
five-year period that the Taliban was in
internally involved in discussions that
indicated that they would be willing to
enter into a peace agreement with the
government of Afghanistan or that they
believed that continued combat
operations was the key to success
either one of you
their petitioning their participation in
the Doha agreement I'm not talking about
the participation I'm talking about
intelligence indicating whether or not
the Taliban really believed that that
that that that the path the success for
them was a negotiated peace agreement or
whether they were going to continue to
press combat operations
I did I don't have visibility on the
specific intelligence that would lead to
their thinking okay uh Mr ranking member
I can provide some insight on that yeah
uh in 2017 and 2018 I was in a in my
personal capacity I was outside of
government at that point I was involved
in some track two discussions with the
Taliban
uh leaders their version of diplomats
who were in Doha and
um and in real life synced here because
I have a bunch of other questions to
just answer the question yeah you can
when when the United States removed the
timeline the Taliban at least their
Diplomat said we want to start talks
because we don't want our country to use
their words to turn into another Syria
okay so who who started those talks and
who uh what president agreed to the Doha
agreement
those talks started in 2018 I believe
under President Trump okay and after
that agreement was executed did the
Taliban largely stop attacking U.S
soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan
yes
and then
um uh after the Taliban stopped
attacking soldiers in the ground in
Afghanistan U.S soldiers
did that allow us to then reduce troop
numbers
I'll answer that too yeah
there were seven provisions
for the question after the Taliban
stopped offensive operations against U.S
military in Afghanistan then did that
allow us to reduce troop numbers it did
okay
and then when did that true production
start
a specific date rough roughly speaking I
know that we had started reducing uh
troop numbers uh after the Doha
agreement regardless
the Taliban were not meeting the
conditions required of them for us to be
doing those withdrawals and at a certain
point there was discussion which we
started in 2020 correct correct largely
drastically reducing troop numbers in
2020. we did and we were moving are you
okay next question are you aware of a
provision that me Mr Waltz and Miss
Cheney passed in the 2020 ndaa cycle
that would restrict the ability of the
Trump Administration to reduce troop
levels below 2000 unless certain
conditions and certain planning and
reports were made to Congress
are you aware of that provision
I'm not but I'm glad you did okay well
this passed it became law are you aware
that President Trump uh in early January
weeks before the transition of the
presidency actually waived that
provision so that he could reduce
numbers below 2000.
I know there is a discussion to bring
the troops below 2000 and I know General
milley and Senior military commanders
advised him not to do it and they
rescinded that order so he did it
correct he did then it was rescinded
there were numbers drop below 2000 due
to a presidential waiver in January 2021
correct
or or if you're not aware then just say
you're not I would I would have well
that is true
[Music]
um
if
if we had not withdrawn
by the end of August of 2021
is it uh I want to hear from each of you
very briefly is it your belief that the
Taliban would have resumed combat
operations against U.S soldiers U.S
troops in the ground colonel kurmerich
I believe
I believe if we had not pulled out by
that date
that they would have had a hard time
once the winter started to be able to
actually execute that which would have
given the Afghan government the time and
space to get their feet on your
testimony your testimony is that you
believe the Taliban would not have
resumed combat operations against the
United States uh in in the fall of 2021.
as long as there was negotiations going
at the Taliban where we were
telegraphing what our timeline would be
I believe that they would have respected
it it was the only thing they did out of
the entire Doha agreement Colonel
Kalinda
I think if we did not
talk with them and coordinate a new date
and it looked like we were violating our
end of the agreement then I believe the
Taliban would have resumed attacks
Sergeant Major Smith
sir respectfully I don't have enough
information and I'm not in a position to
give my opinion on this matter and and
had they resumed attacks which most of
the intelligence shows they would have
would we have been able to adequately
defend ourselves with the roughly 1 000
troops we had or would we had to have
added troops on the ground
what we have had to have surged into
Afghanistan again colonel kumrich
my recommendation would have been to add
all the force protection required so we
would have had to have added troops
right I wouldn't call it a surge Colonel
Kalinda
uh I I agree Mr ranking member that we
would most likely have had to add troops
in order to uh protect ourselves
Sergeant mayor Smith
sir again I do not have enough
information to speak educated my point
here is there was a really really hard
decision that had to be made
that uh President Biden made choosing
from extremely difficult Alternatives
that would have potentially caused more
conflict and more combat operations
through 2021 into the present uh thank
you for the additional time I yield back
absolutely thank you ranking member
crowd you consider it a nonsensical
question to ask about if something would
resume that never ceased
right up to the bombing of the Abbey
gate but I now recognize uh Miss
stefanik for five minutes
thank you chairman Mast and chairman
McCall for the opportunity to wave on
this hearing on this committee today I
want to start by thanking our Witnesses
for their service sacrifice and your
testimony today Command Sergeant Major
Smith I'm especially grateful that you
took on this tremendous responsibility
of testifying as I have the distinct
honor of representing Fort Drum home of
the 10th Mountain division the most
deployed division in the U.S army since
9 11. and I want to make sure in today's
hearing that we remember to highlight
that although Joe Biden and the Biden
Administration made Reckless decisions
that resulted in the avoidable tragic
deaths of our service members
it is important to recognize so many men
and women in uniform who served
valiantly and bravely in the spring of
2021 Command Sergeant Major Smith you
met with the U.S embassy site survey
team and they told you they were
considering Bagram and H Kaya as two
potential evacuation operation sites why
did you advise the site survey team
against using H Kaya and Warrior
concerns taken into consideration
ma'am I appreciate you let me speak
um as far as the site survey team taken
my advice into consideration I I don't
know the private conversations they had
after they left I I cannot speak on that
uh from from my standpoint
um
Bagram had a much more tactical
advantage to conducting Neo out of it
was much easier to defend uh the uh the
entry control points were very much
defended in depth it would have been
very easy to to create a filtering
process within those entry control
points to filter out those that needed
to be evacuated and those who didn't it
was just a much more tactically
advantageous location and meanwhile the
Taliban was rapidly advancing on Kabul
and every day it became clear that an
evacuation would likely be necessary and
the recently released State Department
after action review shows that the Biden
Administration understood that the
closure of Bagram meant that the only
place this evacuation would be conducted
would be H Kaya and we know there were
113 soldiers from Charlie Company 431 of
the 10th Mountain division assigned to
protect H Kaya as the Taliban was
rapidly approaching from your extensive
experience in Afghanistan was a company
size element adequate to perform the
mission the 10th mountain soldiers were
assigned
ma'am if I was in command I would have
had at least a battalion there a
battalion that is a big difference from
a company this disastrous decision
leading up to the Afghanistan withdrawal
forced Charlie Company 431 into a
mission that was nearly impossible to
execute and yet for over a month the
brave Soldiers of the 10th Mountain
division defended H Kaya as Afghanistan
was engulfed in chaos this hearing is
important to bring transparency and shed
light and ultimately answers to those
families particularly our gold starred
families of whom I know some are here
today we can never thank them enough for
their sacrifice thank you for your
service and I yield back the balance
chairman mast
thank you Mr stefanik chair now yields
five minutes to Mr Kim
thank you Mr chair thank you to the
three of you to come on out here Colonel
comerich I want to start with you you
know we talked a lot about the Doha
agreement you were talking about how the
you know the seven conditions you know
six were not met but I want to just kind
of start by taking a step back uh did
you agree with the approach of of
starting those negotiations with the
Taliban to start with it was a it was
there was a lot of controversy about
that you know should we be engaged in
negotiations directly unilaterally with
the Taliban without the government of
Afghanistan at the table what were your
thoughts about that
I think uh the it's clear that when you
do 20 years of war you have to find an
end it starts with open conversations
and it starts with having those open
channels of communication with the
Taliban I think that that was an
important step I think it was something
that needed to begin so that we could
then expand it over time to bring in all
the parties that were relevant to the
situation so you supported the idea of
starting with the Taliban without the
government of Afghanistan in there and
then trying to see if you can bring in
the other parties in my written
statement I was clear I'm a realist I
know that this has to end at some point
it's really when you control the how and
the when you have to be very methodical
and deliberate about it if that is an
open Avenue to begin the process
absolutely was it a good deal
was a Doha agreement a good deal on
paper yeah sure but the Doha agreement
is worthless if you can't get both
parties to do what is required we
operated in good faith to our detriment
more importantly the detriment of the
Afghan people
when you were talking about the
challenges in 2021 you were talking
about how they were just tactical if I
remember correctly you were saying that
tactically you know trying to organize a
withdrawal in the spring and the summer
is just not a good tactical effort is
that correct that's correct would you
then extend that to the timeline set out
in the Doha agreement the Doha agreement
was uh agreed to in February 14 months
later if conditions were met that there
would be withdrawal so that would bring
it to May 2021 was it was that sort of a
a flaw then in the document to start
with no I think if we got to May of 21
and the conditions were met which is
critical then the stage would have been
set did you did you were responsible
withdrawal you you've talked very deeply
about your distrust of the of the
Taliban did you have a belief that that
those conditions actually could have
been met all seven conditions
realistically
we wouldn't get into this conversation
if we didn't believe that there was a
chance
the problem and I think Colonel Glenda
hit it too it's so you thought
realistically there was a chance that
the Taliban would agree to all seven
conditions
we wouldn't have put him out there if
they hadn't I mean you had to you've got
to take a leap of trust to say look
we're going to give you the opportunity
to do it the conditions based portion
even if you take a leap of trust I mean
you know have some sense of contingency
and setting that kind of timetable up
front of of May uh look I mean you
talked about how there there haven't
been these conditions met you know I
agree with you there were not the
conditions met and you and if I agree if
I heard you correctly you said we should
not have started troop withdrawals and
reductions unless the conditions were
met is that correct that's correct yeah
so I just want to just make sure that so
then the withdrawals that happened you
know on October 7th the reductions to
less than 5 000 Trump's saying we should
try to have the troops home by Christmas
so you would disagree with those
decisions as well
I think there was prudent steps taken
when we saw the conditions weren't being
met when we began our troop withdrawals
and then we saw that there was no
intention of the Taliban to actually
follow these at that point you know
General milley and other senior leaders
talk to the president and they halted
the withdrawal at that point to make
sure that we were making sure that the
conditions were driving the decisions
yeah Colonel calendar I want to bring
you in on this I mean I I hear what I'm
just trying to tease out here is uh is
that
and I think you kind of really hit the
nail on the head just these were
systemic problems across the board over
20 years for administrations two
presidents of either party I mean we
recognize there are problems and and
mistakes that were made uh leading up to
the withdrawal but also you know going
backwards would you agree with that kind
of statement there
in February 14th of 2018 the Taliban
issued an open letter to the American
people saying they wanted talks
and I agree with my my colleague that
we've got an obligation
fighting a just War to
explore those opportunities
now you negotiate to secure your
interest not to give them away and the
dilha agreement seemed to trade make an
agreement trading no U.S troops for
Promises of no terrorism and then there
was no accountability so there's no
single person who was able to below the
president United States who was able to
say the Taliban or material breach we
are stopping to withdrawal and we are
resuming
um you know military operations against
them nobody had that Authority and again
it's this it's this Silo problem and and
a related problem is that
um the state department does not have
any body of expert knowledge on how to
conduct wartime negotiations in which
the United States is an active
participant this is a major shortfall in
the state Department's body of knowledge
it's a major shortfall in our national
security thinking and one of the Common
Sense reforms that that we can make to
prevent something like this from
happening again Grant thank you I yield
back thank you Mr Kim I find it an
Amazing Leap to think that President
Trump Obama or bush are responsible for
what happened in the literal withdrawal
of Afghanistan but everybody is entitled
to their opinions I now yield to Mr
Waltz for five minutes thank you Mr
chair and yeah I think we we hear this
from the other side of the aisle uh
quite a lot well we have to put this all
into context and there were a lot of
mistakes made in the 20 years of war and
and frankly I think that's a sad
deflection
from the mistakes that were made the
debacle that this withdrawal uh was I
could fill this room with Think Tank
reports and studies some of which you
authored uh Mr Kalinda and that I
participated in in the Pentagon back
under the Bush Administration which by
the way talks began in the Bush
Administration they continued in the
Obama Administration all to to varying
degrees uh and then we hear about as
we're hearing from the other side about
well it was really about Doha and heck
we even just saw that in President
Biden's
after action review but the end of the
day and this is the fact that people
just can't get over is President Trump's
National Security team went into him and
said that Taliban are not living up to
it and he did not withdraw
they didn't live up to their end of the
bargain and therefore we stopped and
then we hear well we the administration
the bite Administration didn't have any
choice
they had no problem with the getting
back into the Paris
Accord they had no problem reversing
course on Iran they had no problem
reversing course On the Border heck they
even canceled an entire Pipeline on day
one but yet we're supposed to be you
know we're supposed to believe that they
had no choice when it came to
Afghanistan it's a bunch of crap it's a
garbage argument and I think deep down
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle know it in in their hearts so
let's let's just stick to the fact a
hand of this withdrawal and how it was
handled Colonel kromrick your senior
staff officer in in Central Command and
you're testifying that President Biden
ignored the military of advice of three
four-star generals General Miller
General McKenzie and general milley
correct
that is correct and it's probably it's
safe to to articulate that our soldiers
their loved ones were asked to do two
conflicting missions to completely get
everything out as fast as possible in a
full withdrawal
but yet also facilitate an evacuation is
that accurate correct
that is correct
sergeant major you're testifying that
your best military advice on using
Bagram instead of H Kaya was also
ignored is that correct
that's not the way it happened sir we
did not do it out of Bagram
and on Bagram and this is critical to
the family sitting behind you was the
prison holding seven thousand seven
thousand of the most hardened terrorists
including the suicide bomber that killed
their loved ones at Abbey gate correct
that is correct were you aware of any
contingency planning the Afghans
regarding it but they needed the base
for power for life support for supplies
were you aware of any contingency
planning as the Taliban are closing in
on Kabul to deal with those prisoners
should that prison fall or should they
be released were you aware of any
contingency planning either
anyone I was not sir
hey
finally I'll just ask you
were you aware of any contingency
planning to deal with our sivs
key Afghans like Ministry officials
journalists women activists people that
the Taliban would obviously had targeted
for 20 years and would continue were you
aware or including heck our own U.S
citizens any contingency planning as
part of this rapid withdrawal to get
those folks out should our assumptions
that the Afghan government could hold in
the military uh in the Afghan military
would hold would fail any contingency
planning along those lines no and it
became very painfully obvious under
extreme duress how big of a gap that
that was
so this was an utter lack of planning
that their loved ones paid the ultimate
price for and that our Afghan allies
right now today are being hunted down
as we speak are still paying the price
for and future American soldiers have to
go up and to go back and clean up this
mess as we've had to do in Iraq from the
Obama Administration decisions
I mean there's a direct causality there
in your opinion
thank you and what would happen to a
leader in the military who ignored
intelligence and failed to plan in this
case till the day before resulting in
troops killed what would happen
they would get court-martialed how does
it make you feel that not a single
official has resigned been relieved been
court-martialed even laterally
transferred heck how does that make you
feel
terrible and I would like wanting to
take responsibility you know when JFK I
had the Bay of Pigs he came out and said
the buck stops with me you know I am not
only they're not taking responsibility
president of the United States saying
it's outstanding success so it
should at least secretary blinken with
State Department in charge of this
operation in your opinion at least
resign he's not going to be fired by the
President should he at least resign
I can't speak of what he should do but I
would say that senior leaders definitely
need to be held accountable in that
organization
well they're not under this
Administration uh Colonel but this
committee will not let this go thank you
Mr chairman for your Indulgence both uh
both uh both chairman and to to our
families we will not let this go as long
as I sit in this seat we will drive
accountability for you and for your
loved ones thank you Mr chairman thank
you Mr Waltz we now yield five minutes
to miss Titus
thank you Mr chairman and thank the
witnesses and I too honor the gold star
families who are here and appreciate
them sitting through and having to
relive some of this I would point out
that uh you've been mentioned about the
7 000 prisoners released part of the
Doha agreement was to release 5 000 of
those prisoners isn't that right uh
colonel krumich
I would have to go back and look at the
numbers but that was that was part of
the Doha agreement if conditions were
met and people were acting in good faith
that there would be steps taken now as I
understand it you were the chief of
staff at Special Operations Command
Central starting what back in 2019. I
wasn't so while you were there uh
wow you said over and over and over and
over we've heard this there was no plan
no plan no plan did you see any planning
during the time you were there starting
in 2019 leading up to Doha
but to be clear
us-4a had plans like on the military
side and this is something I want to
make sure is really clear the military
has military plans and they executed
them with under great duress and they
executed very well both the acting of
the withdrawal which was key I mean they
did that in an incredible timeline and
it's a testament to the planning and the
execution given the nature of the plan
and the actual Neo itself to get 120 000
people I appreciate that I know how well
our military performed and how many
people were removed but why then do you
keep saying there's no plan no plan no
plan
no I don't think I said that I said that
I said that there was a man up here keep
saying it now the plan that we put forth
as the military recommended course of
action was not chosen and a separate
course of action was selected by the
administration which focused on the
Diplomatic footprint going back to my
earlier testimony there was three goals
the first was I've got the testimony I
can read it uh you know talk about
diplomatic Solutions this is a committee
that looks at foreign affairs not a
military that's uh that's a different
committee so I'd like to get back to
some of the diplomacy we've heard a lot
about how the women and children left in
Afghanistan or women and girls are being
so mistreated isn't it true that during
the negotiations where the Doha plant
there were no women at the table no
women in the room would that have made a
difference in some of the decisions that
were made uh doctor could you come on
that Dr Kalinda I wasn't in the room at
Doha I know on the certainly on the
Taliban side there are no women present
I think on the American side uh maybe
there were
um
so that's always part of the about as
part of the Afghan government as Mr Kim
was saying that they weren't in the room
either were they no they were not in the
room okay okay all right well another
thing is it would reform that we this
we've got to look at fixing this we've
got to look at how to make it better not
just keep going over and over and over
again about how terrible it was we
acknowledged that we there were mistakes
made that our hearts go out to those
families but let's try to prevent it
from happening again maybe one of the
reforms that we could make and talk
about is expanding that Afghan uh
adjustment I think an Afghan agreement
act where we look at the number of visas
that are provided to get families out
can we expand that would that make a
difference would that be helpful I was
talking with congresswoman I was
speaking with one of my former
interpreters
yesterday who I helped get a special
immigrant visa and his family is still
in Afghanistan his parents he's got
siblings still in Afghanistan under
threat and it would be it would be
wonderful if
immediate family members of our SIV
holders could qualify as well well let's
do something that that something come
from this other than just a rehashing I
think that's something that the
committee uh should look at you also
mentioned that in your written testimony
some of the solutions that we systemic
Solutions the problem with the silos
nobody on the ground would you just lay
out for us some of those other Solutions
so we can read it but let's put it on
the record uh sure congresswoman uh the
the first one I mentioned is we need a
basic National Security
Doctrine at the military called a
Doctrine or set of terms and Concepts so
we're using across agencies we're using
the same terms to mean the same things
um I was
in the White House situation room
listening to people use the word defeat
reconciliation
um other terms to mean completely
different things and that impeded
communication undermined our ability to
coordinate uh the terms evacuation and
withdrawal mean different things to
different people if we were speaking the
same language within the administ within
any Administration across agencies then
we would have a much greater chance of
improving communication and coordination
fewer things falling through the cracks
second or related to that is
we need to we need to have a Doctrine
about war termination the military
doesn't have one the state department
doesn't have one state Department's got
no expert body of knowledge on how to
conduct wartime negotiations in which
the United States is the active
participant and it has not worked out
well every single time so that expert
body of knowledge is not difficult to
create and something that you know could
be could be done fairly uh rapidly the
the next
reform is to actually put somebody in
charge on the ground of our Wars so
instead of right now all the silos
deploying by Silo so the lowest ranking
person that anybody on the ground
reports to
the senior leaders on the ground report
too the lowest ranking person they were
all report to is the president of the
United States I mean you can't run a
business that way you certainly can't
run a war that way so we need a a
congressional equivalent of like a
Goldwater Nichols Act
for the interagency which gives the
president the capability to appoint a
senior civilian or military official
to
um to be in charge of our of our all U.S
efforts on the ground and everybody
reporting to uh you know to to that
individual and that person is then held
accountable by the president for
achieving U.S aims and can also appear
before Congress
for proper oversight and accountability
it would
we're missing that today in this in this
hearing there's one no one person
Congress can point to and say talk to us
about this disastrous evacuation
um and then the the final point is we
need a much better
Doctrine for how we build developing
military institutions
the way we built the Afghan military was
in our own image and likeness because
that's what we knew but there are other
models for militaries and if we had a
greater menu of options and you know
what sort of considerations would make
one option more advantageous than
another we could have built an Afghan
military that was much more self-reliant
much less dependent upon us and quite
frankly I mean I'm a consultant I work
with clients and I've got an ethical
obligation to make sure that when we
part ways which we will always do that
my clients are better off and they're
able to sort in New Heights on their own
um
what we did creating such a dependent
military was
um was uh malpractice
thank you very much thank you Mr
chairman absolutely Miss Titus and I
would think just personally that if the
president does a delegate delegate an
authority then
he has the authority in the individuals
report to the president directly should
he not delegate somebody in that I now
yield five minutes to Mr Isa oh thank
you Mr chairman and uh
I'll just briefly say the first time I
was in Afghanistan was shortly after uh
we went in in 01 and I observed that it
was a
I observed that it was never much of a
country I went to the so-called Palace
and I was underwhelmed by the facility
that the king had occupied so it doesn't
surprise me that it that 20 years later
we still had problems
during that time I saw rapid corruption
including Karzai who he and his brother
raped the country of a number of phrase
that raped the American taxpayers of
billions of dollars
we can talk for as long as as anyone is
allowed about the failures of
Afghanistan but I do want to talk about
the subject Azure here for a moment
sergeant major you uh you laid out the
difference in the facilities one which
was defendable one which was able to
almost occupy a Siege if necessary but
if I'm correct would have required some
flexibility in the number of Personnel
in other words if you have a mandate of
less than a thousand and they have to
include the embassy then you really
don't have the flexibility to use uh
bogram is that correct
sir Bagram that being such a large
military installation it had 84 guard
towers and that takes a significant
amount of manpower to man so given maybe
double the amount 2 000 or so you could
have defended that that error base and
that's 2 000 not including the people
operating aircraft and other things that
might have been left there but Bagram
could have been maintained and would
have been safer had we had some
flexibility from the commander-in-chief
as to the number of uh uh a Personnel
correct sir if you had 2 000 people
Bagram would be a much safer location
okay uh Colonels uh I'll I'll address
you together for a moment you both went
to the war colleges you you both went
command and general staff so I'm going
to go through a little quick history
I'll try to be as quick as possible
during Vietnam
the now 100 year old Henry Kissinger
negotiated what some would call a flawed
agreement you know they they had these
peace agreements but both during the the
time and afterwards isn't it true that
when Richard Nixon saw failures to
comply saw aggression saw an attempt to
take ground by his adversaries being the
North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong he
bombed the out of him is that
correct using a technical military term
am I am I not remembering history that
if if you're non-compliant with it that
the commander-in-chief
uses his or her authority to essentially
let them know that there was a
consequence for not obeying an agreement
that is my recollection okay so knowing
that the commander-in-chief had a
history in what people often call that
failed withdrawal of Saigon which by the
way was long after we had left and our
military had left uh and it and it
really was a post period
we certainly uh could have a discussion
about you know failure to to plan a Neo
sufficient
I'd like to just go on to one other uh
Benghazi there are similarities with
Benghazi which seems to be there was no
plan to withdraw the military didn't
know who could do it and the like
and the facilities were insufficient in
the investigation of Benghazi what did
we find we found that the facilities
chosen the facilities in which the
Ambassador was hunkered down were not
compliant with any state department
requirements in fact he died because the
fuel tank was right next to where he was
supposed to be in a safe house so
sergeant major I'm going to come back to
you
the actual loss of 160 human beings plus
and 13 of our service members
can it be reasonably attributed to the
difference in facilities chosen between
Bagram versus hkaya
so the events that happen on Abby gate
um I believe that if that would have
that would not have occurred in Bagram
the defense that Bagram held
the ability to see
for you know
hundreds of meters and the defense in
depth of those control points I do not
believe the result would have been the
same
okay
I'm not going to defend the work of the
Secretary of State Pompeo in the Doha
agreement but I will ask uh Colonel I
think I'll start with you
am I correct that there roughly were
sort of nine months and nine months nine
months of the Trump Administration
followed by nine months of nearly nine
months of the
Biden Administration each of each of
them had nine months more or less to
make decisions on that that plan what
would you say were the uh the Fatal
flaws during that first nine months did
for example the Trump Administration
withdraw troops to an artificially low
level did they signal in a way that
would cause people to uh
to evacuate in in you know go through
just quickly were their actions during
the Trump Administration that you can
say absolutely led to the events that
cost 13 members lives that you can you
can point to today
not during the Trump Administration I I
don't see a direct causation during that
time period and wasn't there during that
next nine months plenty of times to make
adjustments based on the actions of the
Taliban during that next nine or so
months
in my opinion there was time to make
adjustments and were there any
adjustments made that you know of during
that period of time that said to the
Taliban that there would be consequences
for their violations no and that was our
failure in the Doha agreement we did not
hold them accountable to meeting those
conditions yet we continue to withdraw
okay lastly the closing the the release
at the time of that five to seven
thousand uh bad guys if you will was
that related to the agreement or was
that inherently related to the closing
of Bagram
I suppose I don't know the answer to
that question well were they released
essentially simultaneous with the
closing of the air base
sergeant major you were probably the
closest to knowing the time schedule
sir I do not know the timeline okay uh
we'll take that one to find out later
Mr chairman thank you very much for your
Indulgence
thank you Mr ice at this point we'll
recognize the gentle lady from
Pennsylvania Miss Dean for five minutes
good morning thank you chairman and
thank you ranking member Crow I thank
you our Witnesses for testifying today
and of course even more thank you for
your service to our country
I also recognize the service members in
the audience veterans and service
members as well as gold star Families my
heart is with you our gratitude is with
you and it's something we can never
repay
this 20-year War cost our country so
much
and while the end was devastatingly
heartbreaking we could not continue to
send Americans to fight a war no longer
in our Vital National interest we owe a
tremendous debt to the more than 2400
U.S service members killed
in the more than 20 20 000 wounded
during the 20-year conflict in
Afghanistan and we are here to
understand what happened and importantly
to learn how do we do better in the
future
as my Democratic colleagues have said
August 2021 did not happen in a vacuum
this was a 20-year war and to understand
that what happened we need to look at
the broader context Colonel crumrich you
testified in response to a question
from my colleague Mr Kim that prudent
steps were taken in 2020 to start
withdrawing troops but later when we saw
that the conditions weren't being met by
the Taliban General Milly and others
ceased the drawdown
but isn't it true in January of 2021
president Trump further Drew Down U.S
troops just days before the change of
Administrations
I would have to go back and look I don't
know the specific answer to that
question I believe it is I think maybe
Drew down to 2500 literally within days
of what we would hope was a peaceful
transfer of power
do you believe that President Trump knew
that the Taliban was not meeting the
Doha deal
yes which is why there was a halt on the
withdrawal in late 2020.
and yet a continued withdrawal in
January just days before he was to leave
office
I would have to go back and look at
those numbers if you would provide those
to the committee that would be really
helpful and I think we need the record
to be as clear as possible for all of
you what lessons should U.S civilian and
military leaders take from this war
Colonel kalenda at one as you point out
what happened in Afghanistan is not
unique there was Iraq before that was
Vietnam I had two brothers who served
during the Vietnam war in the Navy my
eldest brother Bob served two terms two
tours of Duty in Vietnam on destroyers
and Hospital ships I remember as a
little girl the devastation of that war
and of course of the end of that war how
do we prevent another such disaster
colonel uh thank you congresswoman and
I'm not sure if Minersville Pennsylvania
is in your District but one of my
Troopers Dave Boris is buried there at
the at the cemetery thank you for
telling me that
I wrote this book zero-sum Victory what
we're getting wrong about war to address
the exact question that you that you
posed I think there are a lot of
different
reforms that we need to make so we don't
have a disaster like this occur again I
identified a few of those in my written
testimony to include we need the fact
that we need to put somebody in charge
on the ground in charge of all U.S
forces we need a we need the state
department to have develop an expert
body of knowledge for conducting wartime
negotiations in which we're a
participant I found that the whole
process leading up to the Doha agreement
to be deeply troubling where instead of
trying to focus on a deal and putting a
total withdrawal of U.S troops on the
table immediately as participants have
told me it happened we should have have
instead
work this a bit more like the Northern
Ireland peace agreement peace process
where it was a step-by-step process
testing The taliban's Bona fides and
intentions to see if they would uphold
their commitments and and then you got
to make sure that you got accountability
and somebody on the ground who is able
to make those determinations about
accountability
um in in the event the adversary doesn't
doesn't uphold their terms finally we
need something just as basic as a
national security Doctrine a set of
terms and Concepts so we're all
the same terms mean the same things to
the same people we don't have that right
now so DOD speaks one language state
speaks a different language the
intelligence Community speaks a third
language and
um
and coordination uh good strategy good
policy falls to the cracks I thank you
and I see my time has expired again I
thank you all for your service and and
for those in the audience thank you also
I yield back
thank you Miss Dean at this point we'll
uh recognize the gentleman from
Tennessee uh Mr Green for five minutes
I thank you chairman for leading this
critical oversight tiering and I want to
thank chairman Mast for his leadership
uh continuing to hold the Biden
administration's feet to the fire on one
of the biggest strategic failures in
American history
I also want to thank the gold star
families that are here uh thank them for
their unprecedented sacrifice to our
country
I am confident that looking at my fellow
veterans and leaders on this diocese we
will finally get the record straight
I also want to thank our Witnesses for
their selfless service to our nation and
the people of Afghanistan we will
continue to look to your bravery and
your Grace Under Pressure for
inspiration in the decades to come
I find it tragic
that the other side keeps going back to
the previous administration when we know
that during that Administration the
Taliban did not gain massive ground
because they know he'd bombed the bombed
them into Oblivion
when the circumstances changed massively
on the ground and the military commander
said exfil from Bagram Biden told Milly
no it's that simple
and mistakes made throughout the 20-year
20 years of our time in Afghanistan do
not justify stupidity in the end they
just don't
any other wrong doesn't make a right
as I did during the full committee
Foreign Affairs Hearing in March I want
to say a word to my fellow Afghanistan
veterans
our service and our sacrifices were not
in vain
despite the Strategic mistakes made in
Washington
we kept America safe for a major from a
major terrorist attack for over 20 years
no one who served and like myself lost
friends should ever allow these mistakes
we are addressing today to detract in
any way from those sacrifices
we protected America for 20 years
please know accountability is coming
my own combat deployment in Afghanistan
Illustrated to me the importance of
teamwork and dedication to the mission
at hand particularly when it comes to
planning in Afghanistan we always had
our fellow soldiers back no matter what
it took and no matter the personal costs
we took care of our own including our
Afghan brothers in arms because our
mission to keep Afghanistan free and
America safe required it
in one of The Darkest Hours of American
foreign policy you all stood in the
breach to save the lives of vulnerable
American citizens and our Afghan allies
from The Vicious Taliban
you didn't let the mission down even
when the politicians did
you were left without proper direction
or support from your commander-in-chief
but you didn't let that deter you you
all stood up and have continued to do so
in a way that our state department has
been unable or unwilling to do so
for two weeks in August of 2021 we
basically had no State Department in
Afghanistan our active duty service
members and our veterans did the
essential security and humanitarian work
on the ground proving once again that
America's greatest resource in any
challenge is our men and women in arms
you all are a testament to the critical
fact we have learned about the United
States military and our veterans
throughout the global war on terror that
even when Washington fails you you rise
to every occasion America thanks you for
your dedication courage and hearts of
service to your fellow man
Sergeant Major Smith Command Sergeant
Major Smith
you testified that after bagram's
closure only one single infantry company
113 U.S soldiers and two companies of
partner forces was left in Afghanistan
to protect hkaya can you give us the
detail on how complicated this is
and do you feel
there was do you fill that number of
troops with sufficient and why not
Sir with the Turkish forces I need to
preface with their involvement in this
they manned one gate that that was their
area of responsibility it was those the
remaining 113 from that company that was
responsible for the rest of of that
Airfield that includes Manning all the
gates and ecps that includes Manning all
the towers and all the guard positions
it was an exceptionally hard task and uh
um
there should have been more people there
we know that General milley asked for
more and was turned down
um
I have a question now for uh and I hope
I'm pronouncing your name right colonel
colonel comerick is that correct uh can
you explain why you were incredulous to
hear senior officials Express surprise
at the swiftness of the Afghan
government's collapse and the Taliban
takeover
I think there's there's two aspects to
this the first was the underestimation
of the taliban's capability over the
last 20 years we saw them in 2001 that
initial Taliban force was not very
proficient compared to what I saw say 10
years later standing next to a bed in
Walter Reed with a friend of mine who
was a team sergeant that got caught in a
green on Blue attack and he described to
me the Thousand meter accurate
firefights they were having with machine
guns with the Taliban the Taliban were
getting much much more lethal and it was
only going to continue to rise they were
improving and they were getting the
logistics they needed the training they
needed they were a real threat that was
on the rise meanwhile on The Afghan
government side I think it was
crystallized eloquently by uh by Colonel
Kalinda
um
the Afghan government had a kleptocracy
had an issue all the way through that is
preventing them from being able to
achieve what they needed to achieve so
you had this very strong Taliban that
was always going to be a threat and to
your point they were stuck in those 78
districts that were frankly pushed way
out to the hinterland they weren't
important areas
um
but once we Telegraph that we were going
to leave and the pressure was then put
on The Afghan military it was clear that
that increasingly lethal Taliban were
going to have a serious effect we left
immediately
absolutely spinning empty chair when our
Afghan allies were looking around where
did we go
when the Red Storm was coming at them
from the Taliban and at that point
disaster followed I apologize I can't
stay for the remainder of this Committee
hearing and I'm over my time I'm the
chairman of the committee on homeland
security and I'm going to a classified
briefing on the 14
000 Chinese Nationals who've poured
across our Southern border mini with
ties to the pla another tragic failure
of this Administration so I must leave
but thank you for your service to this
country
thank you so much Mr Green and thank you
for your support as well and helping
secure our borders
you know I want to go back to a couple
things that's been said throughout this
uh by my colleagues on the left
you know you have things where they say
well there's no point in us rehashing
this
you know in the military we call
something that's being rehashed as an
AAR an after-action review and the whole
point of conducting those after Action
reviews is to one ensure that these
types of incidents don't occur again
but also to ensure that accountability
is head is held and we can actually go
forward and make sure the right people
are there you also continue to hear well
we need to look at it in its entirety
over the last 20 plus years
you know as someone who had served in
the United States military so as a
combat veteran like many of my
colleagues who are up here
when we take command
and we basically go out on operations
and those operations go wrong we don't
look at the previous command and go well
the previous command had them for the
last two years and it's their training
that happened in the past that's the
reason for these actual incidents and
mistakes
but that's what they want to do to
president Trump
they want to say that well let's look at
its entirety let's not talk about the
Obama era let's not talk about the bush
era Let's ignore August you know 26th
which was under the Biden Administration
let's just focus on President Trump I
wonder if that has anything to do with
the upcoming elections and the fact that
he's ahead in the polls and we're
playing politics which is why we're
sitting here right now over strategy and
over actually holding those accountable
for the actions that they're responsible
for
you know I wasn't an officer I was a
non-commissioned officer so I worked for
a living
and the commands of our major
understands that all too well
the one thing that we know is that when
we deploy out
whoever doesn't come home with us is on
us
we don't shuttle that responsibility and
that blame on anyone that's exactly
whatever it wants to do
I want to also just comment on something
real quick on August 31st
of 2021
President Biden claimed that the Afghan
withdrawal and to quote him was an
extraordinary success
you don't want to play a video if I may
and then I want to ask that exact same
question if you can please direct your
attention
[Music]
now that was an American
who is waving her passport at the gate
that the Biden Administration that the
department of state Secretary of Lincoln
and secretary Austin claims was manned
full-time an enablement of trying to
help
guarantee Americans free access and to
quote biting how she said all you have
to do is show your blue passport and
we'll let you in
he also tried to say that there was no
chaos
in regards to the withdrawal did that
look structured
as
loved ones go through and look through
body after body to try and find their
deceased loved one who had passed
did that look like proper Force
protection like we would have found at
Bagram Air Base
that would have guaranteed the necessary
standoff to Hesco barriers that was
going to be provided the ability to
house
the sivs and P1 and P2 so we considered
proper medical and Biometrics before
just throwing people on an aircraft that
they call the greatest successful
operational airlift in history
even though it's reported that almost 70
percent weren't even properly vetted
do we call that an extraordinary success
colonel
that video is what failure looks like
that is failure absolutely you're
exactly right commissary major what
would you say on that
surrender the conditions that the United
States military found themselves under
I believe that in that chaos and Anarchy
the military had a successful Mission
the conditions were less than ideal
though but to to your exact point and
you're right
the issue and I say this and I spent you
know seven years of my life in Iraq over
three years in Afghanistan Kosovo
Pakistan Northern Somalia
we'll see what roadside IEDs in 2006 in
Baghdad twice
once with an efp which we're all
familiar with
those aren't failures by the U.S
military and those who are wearing the
uniform it's the suits
not the boots who are actually
responsible for these types of failures
and these collapses
one of the reasons I ran for Congress
because I got tired of people who sit
here
trying to make decisions that impact us
as War fighters on the ground
but yet they have no accountability no
understanding
and no actual on-ground experience
themselves
you know less than 17 percent of
Congress is actually made up of veterans
prior to this last election
probably the reason why to your point
Colonel uh colitis that we have continue
to have strategic military failures time
and time again
this incident that occurred
during the botched Afghan withdrawn of
the body Administration
was because they applied political
Optics over military strategy
but they're also responsible
for that intelligence blindness that you
talk about there was credible Intel that
we know was provided day after day
and I've looked at that in our skiff in
the classified briefings and shown the
day-to-day where it was giving an update
on what was going to occur what was
happening where the planning was
planning's finished execution getting
ready to happen and then August 26
happens
and that's why we have 13
of our fallen heroes and 13 new gold
star families and I'm here right now and
proud and hold this in my pocket so I
know I'm not here alone
when I've got
our young Corporal Sanchez his coin
right here with me that was given by his
family
who I know is looking for the same
accountability because his
death was preventable
but so was the Americans in that video I
just showed
you know we report our 13 Heroes but the
thing that hasn't been reported was all
the Americans who were on the other side
of that gate waiting to get in
whose families still don't have a clue
where they're at
the reason I know that there's more
Americans there is because
whenever I heard about what was going on
in Afghanistan Congressman Ronnie
Jackson called me and told me about a
mother and three children that were
trapped in Afghanistan that are his
Amarillo Texas born and raised natives
and he tried to reach out to the state
department to get support and they told
him well we'll call and see where
they're at
he's a rear Admiral as well
and when he called the dod they told him
they couldn't do anything they were in
the midst of a withdrawal
so I put a team together of former
Squadron members and I had the great
support of a friend of mine Glenn Devitt
from The Sentinel Foundation
who we put a team together and flew over
there and actually conducted the first
successful Overland rescue why was it
over land
because the Biden administration had
thwarted our efforts on three different
occasions to rescue Americans even
though we had an aircraft that was
scheduled to pick up 28 Americans
and fly him out
you know it's interesting to me when I
talk about the Americans on the other
side where they're not admitting to them
because one was a woman that we were in
contact with with her two-year-old son
and her father
who are Americans
who we were in contact with and told to
meet at Abby gate who had rehearsed our
entire policy of what we were going to
do in our operational uh I guess our
opcon white paper if you will
and when we found out that we weren't
going to be able able to come in there
and we had to reroute we asked everyone
to leave but she still text and told us
she thought that she can still get in
that was August 26th
and when we tried to reach out to her
again we never heard from her again
so very likely
another American and her son who's dead
you know you also talked and Colonel I
want to just clarify this for the record
when we talked about this metric based
withdrawal the Doha agreement it was
very clear that if the metric was not
met the agreement was not met
that we were not obligated to remove
everyone is that correct
that's my understanding and it also
prior to president Trump leaving office
when he was advised by his generals that
we should not go to a zero-sum game of
just pulling out everyone and we need to
leave advisors behind so that our Afghan
Partners can be ready to repel because
as we've pointed out they started
getting better
then he actually changed the decision to
leave military in country to ensure that
it happens correct
that is correct so it sounds to me
like President Trump listened to the
generals listen to his advisors had an
actual withdrawal plan that was based on
a conditioned based agreement
but yet the Biden Administration
continues to say that all these failures
as a result of the Trump Administration
you know they didn't have any problem
removing things like the remaining
Mexico agreement they didn't have any
problem remembering other Trump policies
but this one thing they were just
absolutely hamstrung
now as all of you have led many men have
you ever been when you take command hell
to say that I can't do what I'm supposed
to do to make changes for my command
when I'm in command I'm in command
critical artists
Kalinda uh sorry uh Mr Mills uh well of
course when you're in command you're in
command you've got constraints and
limitations on you all the time that you
deal with but you know the buck stops
with uh with you and that's why it's
unfortunate that we don't have anybody
in charge of our Wars on the ground
because the buck doesn't there there's
nobody to hold accountable so you've got
the three of us here instead of the
senior official who should have been on
the ground in charge of this uh
evacuation and withdrawal you're exactly
right commissary major
sir I was taught from a very young age
as an NCO that you are responsible for
everything your soldiers do or fail to
do
gentlemen I could not agree more
with the testimonies that I've heard so
far today
and I just want to ask a quick Spitfire
question if I may and and this is to you
colonel kromrick
if we held on to Bagram could we have
better protected from the country from
the Taliban takeover
Bagram would have been my personal
choice and I think it would have given
us a better opportunity would you agree
that if we help Bagram
that we could have also have had two
simultaneous runways running to help
with our near and our evacuation as
opposed to taking over just hki and
giving up auger
well I also would build on that and say
it's really about the plant when you
decide to make your plan all about the
embassy and all about H Kaya you've
limited yourself and you've taken away
any last ability to be able to enforce
the Doha agreement and you threaten
everything that we tried to build and
all the hope that we put in that country
was going to get washed away based on
that decision I completely agree with
you and I would also note that the bite
Administration not only tries to puts on
the Trump with regards to the actual
withdrawal but when the U.S government
takes over hki which is a commercial
Airway then all the people who are told
November 11th is this magical date that
we're going to go on who had booked
their flights on August 26th who had
booked their flights on August 30th who
booked their flights on September 1st
through Emirates through cam air through
Ariana through the other providers the
minute the US government takes control
over that airport all those commercial
flights got canceled
which is single-handedly responsible for
the entrapment of the Americans that
were actually left behind and my last
question which I just have because all
of you especially you Colonel who is in
charge of Socom other nations including
the UK Special Forces
was actually out there rescuing
their citizens to ensure they got out
yet the U.S never did why was U.S soft
not allowed to rescue Americans
this is an unclassified setting
I know that us soft was highly engaged
and highly active
my personal opinion is the scope of what
was being asked was so vast and the time
that was allowed for that to happen made
it an impossibility
for us to be able to thoroughly be able
to execute exactly what you're talking
about
thank you so much again it goes back to
the original point which is that not
only were these 13 Heroes
their death preventable with proper
planning
with proper military strategy
with ensuring that if the metric and
conditions-based agreement was not
adhered to that we weren't just going to
fall apart and withdraw and give
everything over to the Taliban after 20
plus years of sacrifices trillions of
dollars and thousands of lives this was
a planning failure on the Biden
Administration and that's who needs to
be held accountable here and I can
promise you that's who will be held
accountable here
with that I'd like to recognize my good
friend from Texas Mr Moran for five
minutes
thank you Mr chairman and thank you to
each of the witnesses for being here
today to share your testimony thank you
in particular particular for putting
national security policy and Foreign
Affairs policy ahead of politics I
appreciate that your commitment to
improving our future Behavior by
evaluating our past decisions is
underscored by your presence here and
the testimony you've given and I deeply
appreciate that Colonel crummer I want
to start with you you mentioned that in
your testimony that the administration's
timing and quote selective intelligence
blindness were two of the three
fundamental flaws that directly directly
threaten the military plan and Mission
execution that was from your testimony
I'd like to know in your opinion what is
one of the most Grievous or egregious
examples of quote selective intelligence
blindness attributable attributable to
the blind Administration during the
Afghan withdrawal process
there's a number to choose from
I think the key piece is when you have
over a hundred years of experience
between those three four-star generals
and they're telling you based on all of
this experience that we need to hold off
on the withdrawal until the conditions
are met and these are the reasons why
operationally and based on the entire
intelligence Community telling you that
this is needs to follow the conditions
when that was not followed and the
decision was to go to this diplomatic
Island in Kabul at that point it was the
biggest mistake made by the
administration they should have listened
to those that had been living it those
that had had to endure the losses there
and failure to do so was catastrophic
and the reason why we put those
conditions in such agreements is because
if they're not followed then the
obligation for our activity then goes
away it's a basic principle of law in
any contractor conditions proceeding if
those are not fulfilled then the other
party does not have to fulfill its
commitment or obligations and in this
case you're saying we just ignored the
fact that they didn't fulfill their
conditions proceeding is that true
that is correct well that is correct you
also said as well well known that
between May and October is Afghanistan
fighting season and the Taliban are at
their strongest and the Strategic plans
for withdrawal that were offered to the
administration was this a well known
reality related to the administration
absolutely there's 20 years of
experience the Afghan fighting season
everyone was aware of it but it seems
like in their execution of plans they
ignored that uh reality would you agree
with that
absolutely how high would you rank
timing as a means for a successful
Mission when considering the taliban's
season of aggression that was well known
for decades it's extremely important
some people focus on courses of action
but I would always argue that the timing
of your operation absolutely matters
just as much
one more question for you and then and
I'll move over the dice but to the best
of your knowledge what agreements if any
did the U.S make with the Taliban after
a Kabul fell
I am not privy to that answer does
anybody at the diocese have an answer to
that question Colonel uh Kalinda do you
do you know as well or I do not in
Sergeant Major
I do not either all right uh Colonel
colinda I want to I want to come to you
and and thank you for uh your testimony
you got about a minute and a half but I
want to give you uh just the opportunity
to to talk about anything that you've
not been able to emphasize today uh that
we need to take away as a a lesson from
this this botch withdrawal as to to what
we need to do differently in the future
what lessons can we learn that we
haven't discussed today
we need to take a yes and approach to
these disasters we need to of course
look at the
immediate disaster of the of the
withdrawal and evacuation also what what
got us there uh because if if we don't
we're going to wind up in another war
that ends up in disaster so I I offered
you know three of the immediate causes
of of the collapse and and these rhyme
across Vietnam and Afghanistan I mean
the first one is the Afghan government
never bothered to gain the buy-in of the
of the Afghan people as uh
uh Colonel Kremlin krumrick said they
they became a predatory kleptocracy
um government of Thieves where positions
were for sale for exorbitant amounts of
money a police chief in a big Province
might go for as much as 3 million US
Dollars and in exchange for that
buying their position they were able to
use the position
to make make the money back through land
theft kidnapping for ransom extorting
our Aid in development dollars Etc and
all these actions pushed Afghans into
the arms of insurgents who were
targeting and killing our soldiers
um
a second uh you know a second major
reason is
uh that is as Colonel krummridge said
the the Taliban were much more
Innovative we got very complacent over
20 years uh believing you know we in the
Afghan government believing that we
could do the same thing over and over
again and expect similar results but
when a Taliban are innovating militarily
politically diplomatically eventually by
the summer 2021 they had the upper hand
and sadly many Afghans saw the Taliban
as the lesser of two evils
uh and third and finally is we have got
to create a a some sort of doctrine that
helps us build
developing World militaries much more
effectively we can't afford to make them
in our own image and likeness it doesn't
work there are other models that would
have made the Afghan military more
sustainable able to able to stand on its
own and not simply collapse like a house
of cards that's our fault uh and we
should fix that
thank you gentlemen Mr chairman I yield
back
thank you so much and myself and the
ranking member are just agreeing uh on
the fact that you're right we can't
continue to model everything as if it's
the U.S model and then expect that to to
go forward so thank you for those that
was a great uh layout in your right
military Doctrine drives it at this time
I'd like to recognize the gentleman from
Georgia for five minutes Mr McCormick
thank you Mr chair and thank you for the
witnesses thank you for your service
as I listen to the
not just the testimony but the people
asking the questions a lot of us have
served overseas a lot of us have a lot
of joint service all right right around
here I'm saying I'm looking at Air Force
Navy Marine Army literally right in a
row uh people are your brothers in arms
asking you questions understanding that
that uh you guys were there and you did
that and we appreciate your service and
appreciate your testimony today
um
a lot of us when we talk about the
withdrawal for example uh
when I I remember when the withdrawal
was happening it's probably one of the
worst adult experiences I've had in my
life that may sound over dramatic you
know I wasn't even there but but yet
anybody who served and understands
the people we've lost the friends we've
visited the grave sites the time we
spent away from our family the months
and years even that we spent away from
our families all of us the traumatic
brain injuries the limbs lost
2 461
deaths
trillions of dollars 20 years of
investment to give it back to the people
who now are harboring I think what 27
bases that are are training terrorists
now
that hurts and and it I'm not over yet
and I don't think any of us are and so
when I hear people talk about well we
just need to learn lessons you're right
we do need to learn lessons and that's
what this is about
um you've already talked Colonel I
really appreciate chroma uh you're
talking about some of the different
things that we've made mistakes on the
timing the Manning the location all of
the witnesses have talked about one of
the things that we haven't really
um totally addressed in my opinion was
the command climate and this goes all
the way to the top I'm an ER doctor
I'm also a military pilot military ER
doctors matter of fact both in the ER
and in the cockpit when things start
going wrong I've empowered everybody in
the room to stop me I don't like to land
here I don't feel comfortable there's
something wrong with this the way we're
approaching there's something wrong with
the way we're doing our mission in the
ER if I'm given the wrong drug
or give me the wrong command anybody in
the room can question me at the time
that's a command climate which keeps me
from making mistakes
the question is as you commanders or
boots on the ground
we're executing the mission as you saw
it but you're giving feedback I assume
in the same command climate I don't feel
comfortable with this
do you feel like you are empowered
and had been heard and acknowledged in
your concerns I'll start with the
kernels
within the military structure and the
plan there is a lot of transparency on
the options that we presented and then
the directive that we and the orders
that we received that we needed to
execute
as I had remarked earlier there was some
shock or there's a lot of shock there's
some cynicism because a lot of us had a
really bad feeling of what was going to
happen
however I will say that the military
leaders
General McKenzie
general milley you know they do what we
do in the military they followed orders
they did the best that they could with
this and we executed the best that we
had the ability to do it and there were
some tough days
you know having to watch Joe McKenzie
get on TV and talk about Abby gate was
really really difficult and he had a
serious burden to carry on his shoulders
um and I think what gets you through
that is knowing that we're doing the
best that we can in the military we
executed too and FDR said no we're going
to go into North Africa
um
Truman disagreed with MacArthur about
about the atomic bomb so so it's not
unusual for leaders to take all that in
because they have to look at a wider
aperture and maybe make an unpopular
decision so I'm just speaking
historically I'm not so let's get into
that real quick if I may uh because
we're running short on time but it's
interesting you're right and and when we
make the right decision we're all held
for it right but when we make the wrong
decision the only way to learn from it
is to say I made the wrong decision the
problem is in this case
command sergeant major I know that you
would look at the board your command
your command structure all the way to
the very top who's at the top of your
chain of command
that's the president of the United
States president of the United States
commander-in-chief
now we can say when McClellan and
Lincoln disagreed we can say when Ike or
anybody else disagree can talk about
when generals are relieved and we can
learn from those lessons but we cannot
learn from a lesson when it's an abject
failure
and no admission
of any mistakes
we talk about learning when our when I
when they when my my friends across the
aisle say we just need to learn from
this we need to stop playing politics
with it but we cannot learn if we do not
admit it stakes and that's the problem
I'm talking about the command climate
I can't learn if my patient dies on the
table and nobody can tell me that I did
anything wrong in the ER
I can't learn certainly if I crash my
helicopter and anybody dies
from my mistake in this case I feel like
we crashed and learned nothing
because we can't even admit the mistakes
that we made from the very top and
that's my concern because if we're going
to go into this look we even have a
problem right now we continue policy and
we don't talk about this very much but
we're continuing to spend billions of
dollars
now this doesn't have to do with the
withdrawal directly this has to do with
what's happening right now the American
people need to know the Afghan fun
which is basically subsequently been
transferred 3.5 billion in seized assets
from the fund with the purpose of
stabilizing the Afghan uh Central
banking system
of course the Taliban basically takes
that and used it for whatever they want
to we're supporting a terrorist
organization essentially in the idea
that we're doing something right this is
continued failed policy because we
haven't learned from our mistakes
this is what drives me crazy we have a
command climate inside of our own
government that doesn't listen to our
military leaders who know what they're
doing doesn't listen to Congress or
anybody else because they think they
know best and they continue to screw it
up
that's a bad command climb I don't care
if we're talking politics or militar or
anything else
and that's what we have to learn from
that's what we're here for today and
with that I thank you Mr chair and I
yield now I recognize Mr Perry for five
minutes thanks Mr chairman gentlemen
thanks for your service thanks for
coming I'm over here
look I will tell you
um I still haven't gotten over the
withdrawal from Iraq and the
4 500 plus lives lost there for what
seems to be nothing and what to say to
those families
of course Afghanistan's right up there
and you know I was around watching as a
young man or a young boy
the Huey leaving the the top of the
embassy in Hanoi and I remember the
rhetoric this time where it was not
going to be like that it was not going
to be like leaving Vietnam we weren't
going to see that scene and we didn't
see that scene right it was a chinook
flying with the mountains in the
background or a C-17 with Afghans
hanging off the bottom of it and falling
to their death it is it is unimaginable
to people like me and I imagine to folks
like you who wore the uniform
and you know look we all know the mantra
ours is not to question why or is it
just to do and die and we get that right
we all get that we signed up for that
but at the same time
the American people demand
accountability for their lost for the
blood that's lost for their family
members that are never coming back
for the equipping of the largest
terrorist organization on the planet at
the uh you know at the the heel of the
American taxpayer
and so we got to do our job here we
understand that you're carrying out
orders and they're imperfect and you
don't know what the answer is and policy
makers sometimes don't know what the
answer is we get that right nobody's
perfect we all fall short of the grace
of God
but when we make mistakes we've got to
learn from them so we don't continue the
same failed policy it is our job to get
accountability not just to assign blame
but so that we don't make the same dumb
mistakes again because lives are
precious
and nobody's going to join the service
nobody's going to join Uniform service
if they know that no one here gives a
damn whether they live or die
right we all love our country
we all want to do the right things
sergeant major I I'm just so I and I was
at the time and I still remain concerned
about using
hkia
as opposed to as opposed to Bagram or
yeah Bagram
was there a pre-existing backup plan do
you know
or was it always that plan and and I
know that you had to collapse but still
stay operable but you couldn't collapse
to the to the extent that you had to and
stay operable plus you're also required
to secure the embassy which is not on
the same location knowing that you
didn't have the forces available to
secure both or probably either one was
there a plan
so there there was a pre-existing uh Neo
plan that neoplan uh I'm not sure when
it was uh penned exactly I want to say
it was around 2012 but in that plan the
plan was to conduct a Neo out of Bagram
and and when was it to be what was there
was it just a backup that it was going
to be a choice of either location or was
it we're going to use this one and if
this one fails we're going to go to that
one do you know what the determination
what was the determining factor of which
one to use because
everything was set up
for Bagram but nothing was set up for
hkia
so the uh the plan for Bagram
um
you know being it was uh written in 2012
um we couldn't predict what was going to
happen in the future right the enemy
always gets a vote right all no plan
survives first Contact correct so what
the the exact triggers were in that plan
it never from my recollection of that
plan it was about an 800 page document I
do not recall what the uh the triggers
specifically were to launch in Neo
well
it just seems look you know we none of
us here want a Monday Morning
Quarterback especially if you weren't
there even those of us who have worn the
uniform
but in retrospect well as it was
happening all of us I think that have
worn the uniform were scratch in our
heads saying
that was the hard point that was the
place where we were most prepared to
make a stand and to evacuate from that's
where we're operating out of that's
where everything was located that's
where we're familiar why in the hell did
we not do that and and look there was a
lot of lives lost we don't want to focus
solely on the ones that were lost in the
final days when it seems like it's for
nothing absolutely because every single
one of them is precious in my remaining
time Mr krumrick I think you mentioned
the concept of selective intelligence
and the issues that it posed on the
mission
what if you know now after the fact what
was not mentioned what was if you know
exactly ignored through the selective
intelligence blindness
and what can we learn from that
the plan that was
order to the military to execute goes
back to the first objective of the
withdrawal and the post withdrawal which
was having that diplomatic base
set in Kabul and that looked like the
embassy and then about the four miles
over to H Kaya the problem with that is
it ignored all of the Taliban threat
which we have described here today of
which had only been getting steadily
more refined uh and more dangerous over
20 years and so when you pick that plan
but you choose to not
acknowledge or protect against this red
storm that's coming
it just leaves you
flabbergasted of how did you think this
was going to go and my times expired and
they're good people that have been
waiting to ask a question I just got to
follow up with one quick one based on
that because that's what everyone else
sees
why why did that why did we just ignore
and and why and who who made the
decision to ignore if you can pinpoint
it and and look we can't ascribe motives
but what do you pretend or what do you
suppose is the motive to ignore it I was
not in the room I know what was
recommended
as the course of action and I know what
was given back to us to execute and what
was given back to us to execute was not
what we recommended so someone above the
four-star level is the one who made the
decision to Do It ultimately it resides
with the president
um so somewhere in there would be the uh
the person that you're trying to
identify Roger God bless you thank you
thank you Mr Perry we're now going to go
to Mr Crane for five minutes
thank you Mr chairman for allowing me to
join the diocese today thank you
everyone who's shown up here as
Witnesses and I also want to thank them
especially thank the families the gold
star families that are here today
I want to agree with a couple of my
colleagues that have spoke already on
this topic Congressman Mills and
Congressman Walsh who have talked about
this argument on the other side of the
aisle that's complete garbage
that this administration had no choice
because they were basically just
tracking
with what the administration prior had
been
leading up to
and I also want to double tap on some of
the things that they said because
clearly this Administration did not
continue the policies of the previous
administration when it came to our
border energy
economics and so many other things so I
want to debunk and fact check that false
claim right now because that's exactly
what it is
I also want to acknowledge that this
Administration did not listen to the
leaders on the ground the generals that
were recommending against their plan
many of the witnesses have testified
so far that that's one of the main
mistakes we've made in previous Wars
where people in suits back in Washington
do not listen to commanders on the
ground
I also want to acknowledge that we left
behind seven billion in equipment and
gear 40 000 Vehicles 300 000 weapons all
comms equipment and this is the thing
that scares me the most is somebody
who's served in the SEAL Teams
nearly all night vision equipment
and anybody who's ever done Special
Operations in Modern Warfare knows how
dangerous this is going to be to the
next group of Americans or next group of
allies that goes in there to deal
with some unfriendly individuals
all biometric equipment which is now
being used to hunt down our allies I
cannot even believe that that when I
when I read that report I was like oh my
God even for this Administration that's
appalling
now I want to point out something that
bothers me
severely when John Kirby the White House
spokesman on April 6 2023
made the quote in a press conference all
this talk of chaos I just didn't see it
Colonel krumrick did you hear John Kirby
say that
I did not hear him say that but I wildly
disagree with that statement Colonel
kolinda did you hear him say that did
you watch that on TV I did not see it on
TV but that sentiment makes me uh sick
to my stomach yep
13 dead soldiers
let me ask you guys something
do the soldiers that have lost their
lives and these families these gold star
families especially the ones in the room
today do they deserve that this
Administration and our leaders take
ownership of the leadership failures
that led to this catastrophe
Colonel Chrome I'll start with you
the Sacrifice by the gold star families
and the loss of the 13 service members
is something that
haunts all of us
um you know I had a chance to talk to
them before we came in here and I did
tell them the story of General Latif and
his family who they saved and are now
living in the United States and are a
success story for what happens when you
bring these folks out
um
but their loss is something that I'll
never accept
thank you that is not what I asked you
sir I asked you if they deserve that our
leaders who were in charge of this
debacle take ownership absolutely how
about you Colonel Cole Linda
in terms of ownership there's both
accepting responsibility for decisions
and also determining cause for why these
disasters right this particular disaster
happen and why they keep happening and
that's where I'd like to see the
accountability sergeant major
do these families in these marines and
these soldiers deserve that leadership
take accountability
sir I have a son and a daughter if uh
something were to happen to them in this
same regard I would want answers
absolutely
Mr chairman I've got two more questions
I'll make them quick to the family
sitting behind you that are still
clearly Mourning
by a NADA your head yes or no do you
feel like this Administration has taken
ownership and accountability
yes or no I didn't think so neither do
the American people the last thing I
want to ask you gentlemen is this
Colonel krumwick are you worried about
this current chain of commands
response that is responsible for This
Disaster are you worried
about them being able to be successful
in the war that we are now careening
towards in Ukraine are you are you
worried about their ability to be
successful in that war because we've
talked a lot today about
avoiding past mistakes we've seen what
they're capable of are you guys
concerned about it
I am concerned about the
administration's ability to do it
I am not concerned about the military
leaders we have because they're the
finest cut of the American fabric thank
you sir what about you Colonel colinder
I'm not an expert on the Ukraine fight
so I can't give you a good answer okay
thank you I yield back
thank you very much we are now going to
move to Mr Gonzalez for five minutes
uh thank you chairman mass for for
hosting this event thank you Witnesses
for coming up many of the people that
have spent time in this room today is
what I call part of the warrior warrior
class and the warrior class is is built
on uh fighting and winning wars that our
Nations fought uh part of that is
honoring the fallen and I want to start
by mentioning all 13 names we don't
mention the 13 soldiers Sailors that
were killed uh
about a year ago so Corman Maxton Slovak
22 years old from Berlin Heights Ohio
staff sergeant Darwin Hoover 31 years
old from Salt Lake City Utah
Sergeant Johnny
picardo 25 from Lawrence Massachusetts
Sergeant Nicole G 23 from Sacramento
California
Corporal Hunter Lopez 22 from Indio
California
Corporal Degen Peg 23 page 23 from Omaha
Nebraska Corporal Humberto Sanchez 22
from Logansport Indiana
Marine Corporal Lance Lance corporal
Espinoza from Rio Bravo Texas Lance
corporal Schmidt 20 from Saint Charles
Missouri Lance corporal McCullum 20
years old from Jackson Wyoming Lance
corporal miliola from Rancho cucamanda
Cucamonga California Lance corporal
Kareem nakui from Norco California staff
sergeant Ryan now's 23 from Corryton
Tennessee so we honor our dead we honor
those that have fallen for our country
we also as Leaders make sure we don't
have to read names at a hearing and part
of that is I'm concerned with um I'm
concerned with what happened no doubt I
spent 20 years in the military I'm a
retired Navy Master Chief I spent five
years in Iraq and Afghanistan like many
of us in this room Afghanistan is very
personal to us I grew up there like a
lot of us who spent time there but I'm
also a Navy Navy Master Chief I don't
believe in excuses I believe in results
and I'm focused it's an absolute tragic
tragedy what happened
we also have soldiers Sailors amarons
and Marines in Syria in Iraq and
throughout the world we're going to
continue to fight these War these wars
there are going to be times when we have
withdrawals it's the way the world works
so we have to learn from what happened
to to make sure that we don't read more
names when we withdraw from pick a place
part of that is you Gentlemen please
continue to tell your story complete
continue to be an advocacy in this group
uh in this in this sphere so that way we
can prevent future incidents from
occurring it's also on us as legislators
to do our part and make sure those are
held accountable and we are prepared in
every form or fashion so I just wanted
to spend my time honoring those that
have fallen and also mention it is our
responsibility to make sure that that
the next conflict the current conflict
we don't have the same debacles that we
have the fact that we I had to read 13
names
clearly shows that there's an issue
there's an issue there but once again
less about less about excuses more about
results and it's going to be the warrior
class that determines that we we fight
through the politics in this all thank
you gentlemen and I yield back chairman
I yield back thank you Mr Gonzalez we're
now going to yield to Mr Nunn for five
minutes
thank you Mr chair
I appreciate that Mr Mass thank you Mr
chair thank you very much for the
families who are here first and foremost
to those of you who were the final
Safeguard the breach if you will that
stood the line and helped evacuate as
many as Americans our allies and our
friends who it's been decades serving
with us
this nation owes you a grant a debt of
gratitude
you know I've flown more missions over
Iraq and Afghanistan than I care to
remember but the reality is is that
whether you're the command pilot or
whether you're that first term Airman
who's just operating a sign box on the
back of a Recon plane when you land
you all do an after action and you're
all equals you all have the opportunity
to decide what worked and what did not
work
today you are the front line and perhaps
the only that we are hearing out of the
administration on what that after action
looks like for the withdrawal of
Afghanistan
I don't think
any of us should have to look back
and think that what happened in August
should ever happen to any of our sons
daughters brothers or combat allies ever
again
when President Biden said this will be
no Afghanistan or this will be no
Vietnam this would be no helicopters
lifting off buildings he was absolutely
correct
it was far worse
we had an Afghan government caught
completely by surprise by the lack of
information provided we had a U.S
government that chose as you've
highlighted today selective intelligence
to share not only with our allies not
only with our five eyes our closest
partners
for the men and women who are on the
front line
men and women like Corporal Deacon Paige
from my district
a young Marine
one of 13 whose family now stands as
gold star families because he gave the
ultimate sacrifice
charged with defending Abigail deciding
who got to live and who got left behind
he was provided
critical Intel gaps
arguably selectively by an
Administration who wanted to drive a
timeline based on a calendar date not by
facts on the ground
he gave his life
his family is proud We Are honored and
so many Americans live today because of
his sacrifice and the sacrifice of so
many other families like that to you we
can never salute you enough
but we stand here in the breach so this
does not happen again
Friends when the helicopters left
Afghanistan it saved maybe their
president
but so many more Afghan allies fell off
the tread tires of c-17s leaving H Kaya
something that arguably could have been
avoided and so in today's testimony I'd
like to go into detail here on how we
got to a point
where we abandoned Bagram Air Force Base
Colonel I'm going to start with you do
you believe the top Pentagon brass such
as Austin Millie Miller McKinsey could
have and should have done more to push
back against President Biden after we
rejected their advice to leave a
residual true presence of 2500 in
Afghanistan primarily protecting Bagram
I've thought a lot about this question
and I've gone back and forth on it
they I can speak for the military
leadership
they were in a very difficult position
where they gave the president their best
course of action recommendation and it
was not chosen and they have a decision
at that point
do you continue to follow what the
president said or do you step away
I commend them for holding the line
because
we would have still done it and they
were in the best position to try to do
it as responsible as we can in the very
strict guard rails that were put on that
course of action and they had to be the
face of it
which I don't think was fair but they
were man enough to stand up there and
look right down the barrel of the camera
as things fell apart and give some
responsibility for something they didn't
recommend understood
so let me ask the next question
what would have been the impact if the
United States had been able to keep
Bagram and not been committed to an
artificial deadline but shared the
Intelligence on the ground of the real
threat and been able to get more
Americans more allies and ultimately
protect Bagram Air Force Base so that we
could have the evacuation that could
have resulted in success rather than
failure
Colonel for you
I can only
guess because that's not what happened
but I know that we would have had more
space and time
to be able to try to set the conditions
for Afghan allies to get their feet set
for what was coming it wouldn't have
been this immediate rip out
that left them looking where did we go
in the middle of the fighting season
they would have had a chance I'm not
saying the outcome would have changed I
don't know that there's no way that I
could read the Tea Leaves of the future
if it had gone the other way but we did
when we didn't give them a chance
then we damned them to exactly what
happened
Command Sergeant Major Smith I
understand that you have delayed your
deployment to centcom so that you could
be here today it is both admirable and
greatly appreciated
you highlighted the fact that by
transitioning out of Bagram
we left a well-defended base
with thousands of troops to be able to
support and defend a rear guard action
in the face of what was known to be an
Insurgent Taliban force that in any day
could march on the capital
but instead
you and your team were part of as you
noted just over a hundred infantrymen
and Marines defending an International
Airport Under Siege from all sides
in your testimony you cited that the
site selection team by U.S state
Department raised a personal comfort as
a consideration of whether to use Bagram
could you please elaborate that on that
specifically did State Department give
the impression that they were reluctant
to move Embassy officials there because
the space was let's say less comfortable
at a military base like Bagram
sir that's a correct indication yes
is it your further belief that state
department made choices that were most
convenient for State Department
officials rather than Mission essential
items evacuating U.S Personnel the
destruction of classified information
and sensitive items going forward
sirs I'm not privy to the
decision-making process that occurred at
the embassy I cannot fully answer that
question
thank you Mr chair I would like to just
end with an appreciation for those who
have served including those who continue
to serve as so many on this committee
have stood up to be able to stand in the
breach with you including our own team
in task force Argo that evacuated over 3
000 Americans and our allies by civilian
airline with no help from the U.S state
Department this after action is the only
Insight we have into what's happening
and while I praise you for being here
there are men far above your station
that should be in this room justifying
their actions today so they can never
happen again with that Mr chair I thank
you and I see my time back thank you Mr
Nunn for your service
thank you for your questions I would
just say right now
I see something happening that I've
actually
never seen here before
and it makes me proud and it is I have
colleagues that are sitting down there
with our service members and with
gold star families
just to let them know that they're not
sitting above them they're not detached
from them
but that they're with them and they were
part of the same fight and and chewed
the same dirt in a sense and and showing
that connectivity and
honestly
I've never seen it before in my time in
Congress and it makes me proud to see
that I'll say that very
very truly it makes me proud to see it
we have one other two more individuals
Mr Van Orden and then I have myself yet
but Mr van Norton I yield you five
minutes thank you Mr chairman um I want
to thank all you guys to be here or for
being here I appreciate it command
sergeant major uh rock on dude take care
of the boys when you get overseas and
girls
um I appreciate your efforts uh my
personal history with Afghanistan I
didn't get there until 2003 for my first
tour I held one of my friends hands as
he died
in the old cache when it was a tent we
had a satellite phone next to his ear
listening to his wife uh cry out to him
and to God because she knew that she'd
never see her husband alive again
um when this started happening I could
not sleep my wife told me just to go
back to Afghanistan so I linked up with
one of the groups we referred to in your
testimony and I wound up in Abu Dhabi in
Dubai
processing people that civilians
extracted with the help of a foreign
government
because our government willfully and
knowingly abandoned American citizens
and our allies to terrorists
so I got a couple questions for you guys
was there a written plan for this
exfiltration
colonel
I did not see a written plan for the
exfiltration for this specific Mission
I'm sure the order is given though right
reading through here you're planning and
act you're building an airplane flight
okay we had x amount of years to figure
this out everybody from the Biden
Administration says their hands were
tied because the Doha agreement so they
should have known that something was
happening and when I say the Biden
Administration I mean secretary blanken
uh General Austin now sectef and general
Millie they are all culpable in the
deaths of all of these people because
they are incapable of doing their jobs
everybody I'm a retired Navy SEAL sorry
I should have thrown that out there so I
understand that NEOS are the purview of
the state department and they waited so
long to turn this Neo authority over to
the dod to activate it they're
responsible for all these people's
deaths that is a fact
um have any of you in your vast military
experience ever heard of a plan where
you would intentionally withdraw all the
military forces that are protecting
civilians out before you would pull the
civilians up anybody
no Colonel other Colonel rather
the Douglas MacArthur said that every
military disaster can be described in
two words too late very well that's our
major no sir okay
um why did the Biden Administration in
your opinion command sergeant major I
will not ask you this question why in
your opinion did the Biden
Administration continue to lie about the
number of American citizens that they
willfully abandoned to terrorists in
Afghanistan
I couldn't even begin to speculate
are you willing to accept the fact that
the Biden Administration kept moving the
ball and lying about the amount of
American citizens they abandoned to
terrorists in Afghanistan knowingly and
willingly
I'll say that the statements that came
out from the administration did not
match the fact that we were clearly
seeing on the ground okay Colonel I was
very troubled that I believe 90 percent
of the evacuees were not people who had
served worked were not Afghans who had
worked for the US government or the U.S
military I've got
um interpreters who are still on the
ground that we're trying to get their
sivs trying to get them out and the fact
that this withdrawal often was the
withdrawal of the well-connected and not
the people who are SIV holders I think
deserves serious examination very well
thank you Colonel uh how many of our
native allies that have been fighting
this fight for a long time since 2003
when the lithuanians were trying to get
into NATO how many of our NATO allies
wanted to uh follow this timeline and
get out of Afghanistan on the arbitrary
timeline that the Biden Administration
set how many of our NATO allies wanted
to go on that timeline
to the best of your knowledge colonel
none that I know of Colonel I'm not
privy to that okay I am the answer is
zero
nobody wanted to leave from NATO
this has been a NATO fight for a very
long period of time and you guys didn't
even address this
so this would have fractured NATO
it's unbelievably irresponsible that the
Biden Administration would completely
blow off all of our NATO allies
none of them wanted to leave and then
everybody quotes that we'd have 2500 U.S
forces in the country that's not enough
that's not true
there would have been 10 to 12 000
forces of multi uh multi-cultural excuse
me a multi it would have been an mnd
again
so combined joint Special Operations
task force that I was with we would have
the same thing cjtf 180 all the guys
your 10th Mountain it would have been
the same type of thing
so they're lying
and here's the most important question I
can ask anybody here who
has been fired for this
no one
Colonel to your knowledge
uh no one that I know of okay so this is
the most disgraceful thing that I can
think of that the United States
government has ever done in our entire
history and zero people have been held
accountable from the Biden
Administration zero
right how about the military writ large
zero who was the Ground Force Commander
what's he doing now
you guys know
do you
do you know who it was yeah Admiral
Weasley and then it was General Donahue
I will say in their defense they were
given an impossible situation and they
showed extraordinary leadership when the
every single aspect of what was going on
turned into total chaos for things that
were outside of their control I get it
Senator Tom Cotton when he was
questioning uh General milley asked him
one thing he said why have you not
resigned yet and general milley said he
thought it would be a profoundly
political statement I wish it my friend
Tom Cotton who I respect gratefully did
one more follow-up question General
milley if intentionally abandoning
American citizens and our allies to
terrorists many of them to certain death
is not worth making a political
statement what in your estimation
General Millie is
none of these people that are there and
we're giving them passes I'm not
these General officers and flag officers
should have resigned on the spot gone on
television and said this is wrong
you know what that takes that takes
courage
we have so many things wrong with our
military at the senior levels and in the
Biden Administration it's embarrassing
these people I'm calling for them to
resign General merely should not have a
retirement he should not
General Austin should be I don't know
what that you should be doing but he
sure as hell should not be leading our
military he's a disgrace
Mr chairman I appreciate you allowing me
to speak my piece here and I yield back
thank you for joining us today Mr
Bernard
and now recognize myself for five
minutes
I've heard a lot of things today I
appreciate
every bit of what I've heard I
appreciate you all offering us your
candor and your honesty
and I'd ask that you bear with me for a
couple more minutes of questioning
I want to talk about the sivs the
planning the operations as we've done in
large when I think about planning I
think about
you come up with an objective that you
want to meet
and after you have an objective that you
want you come up with a strategy and
tactics
by which you think you're going to
accomplish that objective
and then you do something really
important
you practice it
so you can see what goes right and what
goes wrong
how things play out when the metal hits
the meat
as they say
let me start with a broad question
Colonel crumrick to your knowledge
what level of practice
took place is a very general question to
the whole of the the withdraw to your
knowledge what level of practice took
place
there is no time when the order was
given to start withdrawing when the
announcement came out on the 14th of
April one may we sell water rolling
basically suck down the drain from all
those ad stations in Afghanistan were
coming back to do an extraordinarily
difficult task there was no time to be
able to go through a full rehearsal it
had to happen now so let me ask some of
the specifics on this was it then not
practiced if a a suicide bomber uh
person a vehicle-born IED something else
went off at one of the the access points
units have that already baked into what
they do for their battle drills for
their standing operating procedures one
of the reasons the speed was so
important with the withdrawal from a
planning perspective was to try to limit
the exposure area for our service
members that would be frankly vulnerable
during the time period of withdrawal
the reason I ask about practice for that
sergeant major you brought up
that you were looking at the level of
services that were available at Bagram
versus H Kaya and you mentioned that the
the level of service there was maybe a
level two Hospital in your opinion
did it matter
that it was a level two medical facility
and not a level three medical facility
sir if one of my soldiers were to get
wounded I would want a level three there
why
for the greater life-saving ability
let me ask some more
planning and practice questions
was it ever practiced that there would
be
thousands evacuated on civilian flights
that pulled cash out of their wallet and
flew Halfway Around the World
to get people out of what was
effectively a still a a standing war
zone Colonel Chrome no
was it practice that an Airfield could
be overrun by a thousand people
no not in this situation it's anybody's
knowledge
or overrun by 10 000 people
sir I can speak on the back I've done
the behalf of Bagram that was practiced
my problem that that was a scenario that
was exercised continually and you
offered analysis based on you practice
this at Bagram but what with h Kaya so I
don't know I I am not privy to uh to
what happened at H Kaya I was not there
but I can say that these contingencies
were very well rehearsed and planned for
in Bagram
how many air strips at Bagram
how many runways
there are two main runways that you can
take off from that I am aware of
was it practice that they may be down to
one Runway at H Kaya
I don't know that it was
a lot of these questions that we can ask
about
what was practiced what was planned for
what was prepared for
and
as I think about the the hundreds of
those that I can ask
largely the answer comes back to
it wasn't thought about whether it was
because there wasn't given the time to
think about it
or if somebody thought about it somebody
didn't want to hear about it
they wanted maybe they wanted a
plausible deniability I won't pretend to
put myself into somebody else's mind
but there was a
a willful ignorance
that took place with this withdrawal
cost the lives of service members it
looked like you had a comment on that
before I finish up I'm happy to hear you
out Mr crummer or Mr colonel
I thought I saw your head school you
know it appeared to me as though there
was a willful ignorance
I think the facts bear that out
and I can't say anything more than what
my colleagues have already said on this
other than that
it cost unnecessarily the lives of our
service members and it leaves those that
are still serving
and those that are still mourning with
the question of
what has changed
and I can't come away after several
hours of questioning with you all
and tell them this is what has changed
this is who learned the lesson
and who would say yes I would absolutely
do that differently
and that's not what I want to be left
with
that's all I can say on that for now
in that
I'm going to
we did have somebody else join us very
good Mr Banks
I recognize you for five minutes
I thank the chairman for holding this
hearing it's so important and to this
point
no one has yet been held accountable for
the
disastrous deadly embarrassing
withdrawal from Afghanistan in fact last
year General Frank McKenzie
then uh General retired General
um in charge of centcom
said he himself had many regrets about
what happened in Afghanistan
in March of this year I asked secretary
Austin before the house armed services
committee sir do you have any regrets
General McKenzie has regrets
General Austin secretary of defense for
the United States of America overseeing
this withdrawal do you have any regrets
he said I have no regrets
and I wonder from each of you how does
that make you feel when you hear the
top leader of our Pentagon of our
military say he has no regrets about
what will happen in Afghanistan Colonel
we'll start with you
extremely frustrated and let down
you know I lost six soldiers for my unit
in Afghanistan in 2007 and the fact that
there has not been a
examination of why these failures
Vietnam Iraq Afghanistan why these
failures keep happening
um is is very frustrating to me because
it seems that the next time we get into
one of these interventions we're going
to make the same basic mistakes and it's
going to heighten the risk of another
disaster and that that I find
unacceptable
sir this is my current leadership and I
am not in a position to speak on the
matter of this question understood
hopefully one day you'll be able to tell
us what you really think
a colonel respond to secretary Austin
though I mean the the arrogance to say
that I mean the families behind you of
who lost
loved ones the heroes that we lost that
that deadly day and other deadly days in
Afghanistan to say that you have no
regrets I mean to me it was as a veteran
of the war in Afghanistan
who served with others who Heroes that
we lost to say I have no regrets and
yeah okay respond to that colonel
all combat veterans have regrets
you know I've been very fortunate where
the VA has been able to help me
and I've got a support team that helps
me work through that every day
but I find that comment
tone deaf and not Tethered to reality
you have to have regrets you should it
looks like September 10 2001 there now
it's only getting worse
there's nothing but regret and pain and
struggle there so I find that statement
to be wildly
um
painful for everyone who's had to put in
Blood Sweat and Tears for the families
that lost their family members I mean
it's it's got me absolutely livid I
don't know what I would say to him
um but I strongly disagree on every
level yeah can you unpack more about
what happened
leading up to the withdrawal there's
been a lot a lot of discussion today
about the decision to close down Bagram
and rely on
the very public airport in Kabul to
withdraw
but can you can you tell us more about
for someone for for General Austin who
led troops in Afghanistan to say has no
regrets
can you talk more about that that
decision to close down Bagram that led
to the deadly the devastation that
happened in Kabul
um how could how could he say he has no
regrets when obviously those were
terrible decisions that were made
I can't speak for secretary Austin I can
explain why that happened from a
planner's perspective
because
this idea and this concept that we would
be able to run this diplomatic Island in
perpetuity and Kabul was something that
the administration decided that's what
was going to happen and they forgot that
the enemy gets a vote and that they
wished away a lot of these other issues
that clearly came to pass that everybody
was warning not just the military
leadership but also the interagency and
the intelligence Community was just
telegraphing this every day
um I I find it
um I guess I just cannot figure out the
decision making
um I know why they picked HK because it
was close to the Embassy and they just
fell in love with their plan
yeah I spent a lot of time in both
places Bagram and
um
the north North Kaya
throughout Kabul it's a decision that
will never make sense to me and I hope
one day we can unpack it more I want to
finish with one quick question my time
is almost expired representative Mills
dug into this question president Trump
let us down a path
to withdraw from Afghanistan but to keep
a light footprint of Special Operation
Forces there in place and I wonder
Colonel if if we would have adopted that
plan that course of action would those
lives likely have been saved that day
speaking as a retired Greenbrier myself
um I have no doubt in my mind that if we
had Green Berets seals Air Force Special
Operations marshock out holding the
picket line with our Afghan especially
the Afghan soft that were there we would
have studied we would have studied much
much greater chance to build time and
space to work on all the things that
needed to be worked on in Kabul yeah
thank you for that answer to the
families who are here I will
spend the rest of my time in Congress
fighting for accountability for those
who made this ridiculous and stupid
decisions that led to the loss of your
loved ones I promise you that with that
Mr chairman I yield back thank you my
friend
I'm now going to recognize Mr Crowe for
five minutes for a closing statement
thank you chairman and thank you to all
the witnesses for coming in today
um there was a lot of ground covered I
appreciate uh your your candor and your
testimony and your work uh and again I
want to recognize the gold star families
for being here
um I I can't imagine how challenging it
is to listen to this and to rehash this
and to see some of those videos which of
course we needed to see right the
American people and we all need to see
that we can't shy away from the reality
uh but uh for being here today I'm
grateful
I'm going to do two things I first want
to address some issues that I I think
were incorrect but that some of my
colleagues uh made some statements and
then the second is I want to provide
some context about the timeline and the
situation as I see it
number one a lot of comments about the
president's statement uh classifying the
the withdrawal as a success
and criticism of that statement that
statement to be clear was within the
context of him applauding the work of
the military and and our troops and our
soldiers right in in applauding their
sacrifice and their service for with the
with the withdrawal and that's the same
type of statement that I would make that
they they worked hard under
extraordinarily difficult circumstances
under circumstances that uh they largely
shouldn't have had to have addressed but
they did their job and they did it well
and they did they did it remarkably and
that's what the president was talking
about
uh second a couple of folks have
mentioned you know that we haven't had
any testimony from officials involved in
the withdrawal or even active
Administration officials that have come
before this committee
um
that's because the majority hasn't
called them
right so uh you know your testimony has
been great and I've appreciated it at
all but if the majority wants to hear
from those folks it's the majority that
can call a panel of uh sitting officials
so I think that criticism is a
non-sequitur as well
um a second is is you can you can
disagree about the logistics in the
timeline but there's also been a number
of comments that have outright Sid that
Administration and certain officials and
including lifelong service members
people who have dedicated their life to
this country accuse them of lying of
covering things up of executing the
truth listen there's just no indication
that anyone's acting in bad faith and
has lied now I disagree with folks all
the time I have my disagreement with
uniform people I have my disagreement
with the administration sometimes in a
variety of issues whether it's
Afghanistan or Ukraine because I have an
independent obligation as a member of
Congress to to uphold My Views right and
I'm not just going to rubber stamp
anybody but to be clear I I've never
I've never for an instant thought that
anyone's acting in bad faith or wanted
U.S soldiers to be killed or put into a
difficult situation or lied about
anything so let's just be real about
that right I think we owe it to folks to
have disagreements and debate about
um the facts but accusing people of bad
faith is just not appropriate
so for my part
I I did disagree with the timeline I I
was very vocal in 2021 that the
withdrawal and the evacuation should
have started earlier uh I I uh we talked
about it in the media I pressed folks
for it I thought that as soon as the
president announced in April of 2021
that we were going to abide by the Doha
agreement and and withdrawal that that
withdrawal should have happened earlier
and we could have spread it out and
could have done it in a more methodical
way so that's my disagreement that's my
view
but the situation was a tough one and I
do want to provide that perspective
very quickly in the time that I have
president Trump
engaged his representatives in the
Taliban
to negotiate the Doha agreement
the Doha agreement was agreed to
and we started our reduction of troops
as a result of that
the and I want to enter into the record
an open statement before this Committee
in June of 2021 by Deputy special
representative for Afghanistan
reconciliation Ambassador Molly fee if I
may
and in this statement which is in the
record I won't read the whole thing it
says very clear that there's no
indication
that that the prior Administration took
into account the taliban's compliance
with that agreement when they made the
unilateral decision to withdraw troops
this is the ambassador who was in the
room
uh said this no indication that was
going to happen so we had a situation
where the Taliban knew we were pulling
out
that Pollard had already started we were
at the lowest troop levels in years the
Taliban was advancing taking provinces
taking capitals had the momentum was on
the March
and in January of 2021 when President
Biden came into office
they had no transition Because by the
way the prior Administration actually
wasn't even recognizing this
Administration as the lawful president
so they didn't even they didn't even
transition with their people on noon on
January 20th 2021 so they walked in
knowing nothing having no transition
having no briefings no plans in place
they embarked on a two-month process to
try to get their hands around the issue
and figure out what was going on then
they made the decision to abide by the
agreement because we had very few troops
there
we were we were being told and the
intelligence was showing that the
Taliban was going to start attacking us
again if we didn't withdraw on time
so the decision the president had to
make was one of two things
withdrawal
under the timeline and do it as quickly
as possible
or stay there and fight
and fight hard and fight harder than we
would have had to have fought for years
and U.S soldiers would have been
fighting and dying then too
tough decisions
so yes things could have been done
differently I'm very clear about that
and there are Lessons Learned and we
will make sure
with the chairman and working with my
colleagues we learn these lessons and do
it better but there is a broader context
that was important and it's not as
simple as some folks would like you to
believe it is I yield back
I think the ranking member for his
closing statement I recognize myself for
a closing statement
we tend to go after each other from time
to time but I don't think it
wanes on our recognition of each other's
service proud to have chewed the same
dirt as you
I hope that you would join me in an
invitation to the ultimate decision
maker
to sit before us and answer questions
about this I would certainly offer that
invitation
I do disagree I believe that there were
people literally working I would say
speaking in bad faith and I say that as
I was doing my preparation for this
hearing and this didn't just take place
in this week I've done timeline after
timeline over the years but specifically
in preparation for this hearing I have
probably a dozen Pages at least of the
comments the remarks from the White
House from Jennifer sake and I know when
I layer those on top of what was
actually going on
at the time
what she was telling the American people
in representation of President Biden
was not what was taking place day after
day daily coming to the to the Press
pool speaking saying something was
happening or going to happen and then
it's simply not being the reality
of
what the ultimate decision makers knew
what was really taking place
and we know
I guess we could say we have testimony
that there was
selective reading of the intelligence
as is always the case intelligence comes
in varying degrees of confidence
and we didn't really get into the
confidence of the intelligence that was
presented today maybe there's another
day that we'll get into it
but in my personal opinion
there was not
inadequate amount of planning that was
done
and there was not planning that was done
to take into account
what was probable and what was possible
it was planning at the smallest level to
take into account what was hoped for
and I've said this before and I will say
it again now is my closing remarks I'm
well aware of the fact
that sometimes in war there is just bad
luck
a bullet is an inch or two inches to the
left or right if it could have gone the
other way
you don't even know that something would
have happened
in RPG and a piece of fragmentation
little piece of aluminum fragmentation
catches a person a soldier in the wrong
place
a mortar hits too close to some place
you're too close to a vehicle born IED
all the possible hazards that exist in
war sometimes it is bad luck
in my assessment
what happened in the withdrawal of
Afghanistan was not bad luck
it was bad planning
it was bad objectives
it was a failure to practice
and it resulted
in incredibly bad results
for some of our very best
and
for the United States of America and our
allies as a whole
in that
I will conclude my closing remarks
I will thank each of you Witnesses for
your testimonies
I found it to be frank forthright and
I feel as though I am better informed
for having listened to you each of you
today so I thank you for that I thank
our gold star families for again for
joining us as all of our colleagues have
to thank you thank you and and rightly
so you raised Patriots
and we've had an opportunity to speak
about the pain that you've gone through
I wouldn't begin to say that I could
understand it because I couldn't put
myself in that place I don't even like
to see my boys or my little girls stub
their toe I couldn't imagine
what you deal with day in Day Out
but I know I'm thankful to you for what
you shared with this country those that
you love the most and in that
I will say
whatever the formal part of this tells
me to say
pursue it to committee rules all members
may have five days to submit statements
questions and extraneous materials for
the record subject to the length of
limitations without objection the
committee stands adjourned
thank you
