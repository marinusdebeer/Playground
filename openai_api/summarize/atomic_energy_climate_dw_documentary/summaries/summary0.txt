**The Nuclear Power Resurgence: A Global Journey to Energy Independence**

As the world grapples with the urgent need to combat climate change, France is reigniting its nuclear power adventure with plans to build six, possibly fourteen, new reactors. The United States, the leading producer of atomic energy, is also committed to leveraging nuclear power to achieve ambitious net-zero climate goals. With no country constructing more reactors than China, the global pursuit for clean energy is evident, even as Japan, twelve years post-Fukushima, considers new nuclear projects. This resurgence raises a critical question: Can we save the planet without atomic energy?

Our exploration begins in Washington, D.C., where the U.S. Department of Energy faces the colossal challenge of transitioning to clean electricity within a decade. Catherine Hough, head of the Office of Nuclear Energy, emphasizes the need for reliable, 24/7 baseload energy, traditionally provided by fossil fuels. The U.S. is betting on nuclear power, undeterred by the accumulating atomic waste, as technological solutions for responsible management emerge, inspired by Finland's progress with their repository.

The U.S. is particularly hopeful about Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which promise to revolutionize the industry with their factory-prefabricated, ready-to-deploy design. This innovation aligns with the urgent need for climate action and energy security.

Poland, heavily reliant on coal, views nuclear energy as the key to transforming its energy mix. Orlen Synthos Green Energy plans to install a fleet of SMRs, with the first potentially operational in Ostrovenka within 24 to 36 months. These small reactors could match the output of coal-fired plants, utilizing existing local grids and marking a significant step towards clean energy.

Turkey's Akuyu nuclear power plant, a Russian-built and operated project, is set to provide 10 percent of the country's electricity. Despite geopolitical concerns, the plant exemplifies the complex interdependencies in the global energy landscape.

Russia's state-owned Rosatom dominates nearly half of the international nuclear market, constructing reactors worldwide and remaining largely unaffected by sanctions. This influence raises questions about energy sovereignty and the potential risks of dependency on foreign powers for critical infrastructure.

In Europe, companies like Siemens Energy are confronting the challenges of ensuring constant energy supply with renewables. The intermittency of wind and sun necessitates solutions like hydrogen power plants and energy storage, but these technologies are still in their infancy. Nuclear energy remains a relevant and efficient option, despite the high costs and waste disposal issues.

The U.S. startup Oklo is pioneering the fourth generation of reactors, aiming to recycle used fuel and power data centers. With significant investment and a vision to connect to the grid by 2026, Oklo represents the potential for a new era of nuclear energy.

However, a major bottleneck for these advanced reactors is the need for specially enriched uranium, a market currently reliant on Russia. Urenco, the second-largest supplier, has seen a surge in demand as customers seek alternatives to Russian uranium amid the Ukraine conflict. Achieving independence from Russian enrichment capacity could take up to a decade, highlighting the urgency for Western nations to enhance their capabilities.

The global energy demand continues to rise, and the window to achieve carbon-neutral electricity production is narrowing. Nuclear power could be a crucial part of the solution, but the West must learn from the vulnerabilities exposed by Russia's actions in Ukraine. Independence and sovereignty in energy are paramount, and the race to catch up in the nuclear sector is on. The question remains: how much time do we have left to secure a sustainable and autonomous energy future?
