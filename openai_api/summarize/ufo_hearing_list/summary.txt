The U.S. Congressional subcommittee held a discussion about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), also known as UFOs, during which several members voiced concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding these phenomena and their potential threat. The 2022 National Defense Authorization Act was mentioned for establishing the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Officer to investigate UAPs. The subcommittee pointed out instances of a deficit in government transparency and concluded with an agreement to demand greater openness from intelligence and defense bodies regarding UAPs.

Witnesses at the hearing included former military personnel and a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, all of whom had encountered UAPs. They called for a systematic and transparent approach to collecting, analyzing, and sharing information on UAP encounters. There was also a push for institutional reform to unify the approach to reporting and investigating UAP encounters and conducting scientific research on them. They also stressed the possibility of a national security threat from UAPs, the need for appropriate oversight, and resource allocation.

The congressional hearing further addressed the stigma around reporting UAP sightings within the military and the need to overcome it and establish proper reporting procedures. It also heard detailed testimony from a retired Navy Commander about his 2004 encounter with a UAP. The general consensus among the members was that UAPs are a potential national security threat that could be probing U.S. systems for vulnerabilities. 

Finally, the public was encouraged to report any UAP sightings they might encounter and continue the investigation into these phenomena to gather objective data.
