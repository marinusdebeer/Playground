The summary discusses a Congressional hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), commonly known as UFOs. This follows a report in 2021 from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that acknowledged sightings of UAPs by military personnel. During the hearing, witnesses discussed their own experiences with UAPs and their potential implications for national security. One witness, retired Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Christopher Mellon, acknowledged that U.S. airspace is vulnerable to potential threats from UAPs. Another witness, former Navy pilot Lt. Cmdr. Alex Dietrich, recalled a close encounter with a UAP during a training exercise in 2004 off the coast of Southern California. The hearing also delved into the reluctance of the military to admit the existence of UAPs and address reported sightings. Rep. Carolyn Maloney said that the stigma surrounding UAPs needed to be overcome and proper procedures for reporting sightings should be put into place.
