In a hearing conducted by the House Committee on Oversight, David Fravor, a Commander with a 20-year aviation career in the U.S. Navy, discussed in detail his encounter with an unidentified flying object, or Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP), off the coast of San Diego on November 14, 2004. Fravor described the object as a 40-foot flying "tic-tac" shaped object without any source of propulsion or evidence of thermal exhaust. He said he did not feel threatened by the object, but did not believe any aircraft within the U.S. could have shot it down, based on its performance capabilities.

This committee discussed UFO sightings, with the general consensus being that they were a very real and potentially serious threat. Lawmakers asked a series of yes or no questions, in which the general consensus was that UFOs could potentially be a national security threat and could potentially be probing U.S. capabilities and testing for vulnerabilities in their systems.

While Fravor didn't speculate about the origin of the UAP, former Marine and Defense Department specialist Christopher Mellon believed the flying object was not from any other nation on Earth, stating that it defied current Material Science and propulsion ability.

The hearing also touched on the importance of whistleblowers and having a process in place to handle UAP whistleblower complaints. Alex Dietrich, an experienced US Fighter Pilot, touched on potential safety issues, stating that he came forward to help mitigate the safety threat posed by encounters with UAPs. 

Lastly, the public was encouraged to report their own sightings, with the importance of gathering objective data and continuing investigations being emphasized.
