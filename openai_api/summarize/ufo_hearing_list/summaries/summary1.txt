The summary of this U.S. Congressional subcommittee would discuss Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), otherwise known as UFOs. It includes members such as Mr. Burchard of Tennessee, Miss Luna of Florida, Mr. Getza of Florida, Mr. Burleson of Missouri, Mrs. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Mr. Ogles of Tennessee. The subcommittee aims to investigate UAPs' nature and potential threat and discuss the lack of transparency involving these phenomena.

There were concerns about the lack of transparency on UAPs causing speculation and public skepticism towards institutions supposed to serve and protect people. Reference was made to former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, who claimed to have seen UFOs, leading to further investigation on UAPs. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2022 established the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Officer (AARO) to coordinate efforts to investigate UAPs across the Department of Defense and federal agencies.

The subcommittee voiced the apparent deficit in government transparency and accountability, citing the Biden administration's handling of a Chinese spy balloon violation as an example. The discussion concluded with the agreement to demand transparency from intelligence and defense bodies regarding UAPs. Witnesses were encouraged to offer ways to improve government efficiency and openness regarding UAPs and further strengthen the country's commitment to transparency and accountability.
