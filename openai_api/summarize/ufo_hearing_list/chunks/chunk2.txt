response to the Chinese Phi balloon debacle earlier this year you may remember the mass confusion that ensued when the balloon was first spotted over Montana four days after it first entered U.S airspace over Alaska the Biden administration's initial inability to address the object grew into a continuous series of embarrassments after news of the balloon reached the Main Street me mainstream media we were assured that the balloon posed no threat to our security however after the balloon was allowed to Transit the entire continental United States fighter jets were scrambled off the coast of South Carolina to shoot it down this flip-flopping and obfuscation caused needless confusion fear and panic across the country It's My Hope Mr chairman that this sort of confusion will not be repeated we should investigate the extent to which elements of our government possess or do not possess information that is of critical value to the American people we owe it to the citizens of this nation to make sure that our government is transparent and accountable we must make sure that our government provides answers and Congress must do its duty to solicit those answers with that Mr chairman I yield back yeah Mr Frost thank you Mr chairman in 2022 NASA announced that it was commissioning an independent study team to examine uaps the NASA team is comprised of scientists across different fields as well as former astronauts and pilots in May the independent study team held that its first public meeting which included the perspectives from NASA senior leaders as well as perspectives from the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies the NASA study team is also expected to release its first report pretty soon and I think it's safe to say that we all eagerly await its results Mr Graves how might NASA's research influence the commercial industry regarding safety and UAP I think NASA has a big role to play as far as commercial Aviation safety and it's one of their original charges as an organization one of the recommendations that have been put forward is to utilize their existing Aviation safety reporting system to serve as a short-term fill and trusted platform for Pilots that want to report on UAP it also has built-in analytics capability and is funded by Congress gotcha and also Mr graves are there any other industries that may be influenced by the NASA research on a uaps and and if so how so well I think there is a a large swath of commercial capabilities that could be brought to bear on this topic from space-based or ground-based sensor systems that are available open source or through commercial marketplaces and I think NASA's work as they work to identify and highlight specific parameters that can be found we can take that information and and promulgate this through the public sector so that we can have more open conversation about what we're seeing yeah you know in 2020 the Department of Defense released several videos of uaps um including Mr freyjer's experience U.S Navy Pilots that recorded footage in 2021 the office of the Director of National Intelligence released a preliminary report on UAP events NASA administrator Bill Nelson stated that NASA would begin to investigate these events in fact I sit on science based and Technology committee and when we were doing a hearing with the NASA administrator Bill Nelson I asked you know why NASA needed to be fully funded and there were many great reasons but one of them was actually had to do with uaps I mean he actually mentioned you know is there life out there I don't know and so either way these actions ultimately LED NASA to assemble the independent study team that I mentioned earlier also in 2021 Harvard University stood up the Galileo project to research and examine the origins of UAP so it seems like both you know from NASA and in the higher education Community because of the work that you all have done and people standing up you know I think we're seeing some of that stigma um slowly going away Mr uh freyr do you believe that military Pilots feeling empowered to share their UAP experiences has directly impacted the scientific communities research goals on this topic I would say yes I would say that you know starting in 2017 when it actually came out it took that stigma away I mean I've talked to multiple Senators who said prior to that if you mention UAP you'd have been laughed off the hill and now you we're sitting here today for a public testimony on what's actually going on you know I I'm hoping that this Curve will be more of an exponential and we'll get more and more transparent to the level that we can yeah yeah and yeah I mean it's important I couldn't imagine you know I'm not a pilot but I used to fly gliders in Civil Air Patrol huh yeah I got a pilot yeah um and so either way I mean I couldn't imagine you know being being in the glider and seeing something and then not feeling like I had the agency to talk about it um Mr Graves can you discuss the importance of seeking scientists to sit on your Advisory Board absolutely I think ultimately this is going to be a scientific problem and not only that it's also an engineering problem I've been working with American Institute of Aeronautics and astronautics to help them stand up a UAP integration committee to help integrate their engineering prowess into this problem and so yes very much I think this is an engineering and scientific problem as much as national security problem and how might Congress help to facilitate Partnerships between the scientific community and the UAP focus groups within government well I think one of the things they can do is to have these types of hearings to communicate to the public that this is a topic of Interest I think that there is a pseudo-market if you will of interested capabilities and talent that want to approach this topic uh and we're seeing that start to grow now so I think continued conversation reduction of stigma is going to allow that to flourish and allow answers to help generate themselves 100 well thank you all for being here and thank you for your work I think it's important that we keep our top scientific Minds focused on this issue and look for ways to increase collaboration thank you so much I yield back Mr Comer thank you Mr chairman let me say I want to thank you for having this hearing I want to thank Mr burchett Miss Luna for leading this hearing and with that I yield my five minutes to Mr burchett thank you Mr chairman I'm going to direct this I believe to Mr grush but if any of you all feel like you need to jump in Just Jump Right In we're good as the U.S government become aware of actual evidence of extraterrestrial otherwise unexplained forms of intelligence and if so when do you think this first occurred use the term non-human I like to denote origin keeps the aperture open both scientifically certainly like I've discussed publicly uh previously 1930s okay can you give me the names and titles of the people with direct first-hand knowledge and access to some of this crash retrieval some of these crash retrieval programs and maybe which facilities military bases that would the recovered material would be in and I know a lot of Congress talked about we're going to go to Area 51 and you know I mean there's nothing there anymore anyway it's just you know and we move like a glacier as soon as we announce it I'm sure the moving vans would pull up but please uh I can't discuss that publicly but I did provide that information both to the Intel committees and the Inspector General and we could get that in this give if we were allowed to get in a skiff with you would that be probably what you would think sure if you had the appropriate accesses yeah what special access programs cover this information and how is it possible that they have evaded oversight for so long I do know the names once again I can't discuss that publicly and how they've evaded oversight I in a closed setting I can tell you the specific tradecraft use all right when did when do you think those programs began and who authorized them I do know a lot of that information but that's something I can't discuss publicly because since all right many of y'all want to jump in on any of this you're more than welcome to um what level of security clearance is required to fully access these programs and I say that because myself um representative Gates and representative Luna were basically turned away at one point at Eglin so please go right ahead uh certainly difference between member access and say somebody like me but anybody who has a you know tssci clearance and meets the eligibility criteria the access adjudicative Authority should be able to Grant you access Ms Merchant if you'll yield so just to be put a fine point on that there's nothing that you're aware of that's above special access program classification it's a misnomer that there's anything actually Above Top Secret executive order 13526 delineates the classification levels right and but I I draw upon on that because we can have access to to those programs and so the notion that we're not being given that access sort of defies our typical muscle memory here in Congress thank you Mr burchard I'll go back to you thank you Mr Gates um along those lines title tenant you might not know this or not but title 10 and title 50 authorization they seem to say they're inefficient it so who gets to decide this in your opinion in the past uh it's a group of career senior executive officials okay are they government officials they didn't announce do what both in and outs of government and that's about as far as all right well that's it leads to my next question which private corporations are directly involved in this program how much taxpayer money has been invested in these programs to your knowledge I mean we know we know we we audit the Pentagon every year and I've been here five years and they failed the dadgum thing every year uh lose over a billion dollars a year we think and I've told the Department of Defense maybe 60 percent of their assets are unaccounted for whatever the heck that means in the Public's sector you go to jail for that kind of crap so tell me yeah I know when I um I'm a dollar off of my DTS travel voucher I get the hammered but uh seems like it doesn't work if you sell over six if you sell over 600 worth of stuff on eBay now you get a call from the IRS so please what corporations yeah I don't know these specific metrics towards the end of your question uh the specific corporations I did provide uh to the Committees in specific divisions and uh I spent 11 and a half hours with both Intel committees okay has there been any has there been an active U.S government disinformation campaign to deny the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena and if so why it can't go beyond what I've already exposed publicly about that okay I've been told to ask you what that what that is and how to get it in the record which uh what have you stated publicly in your interviews for the Congressional Record uh yeah if you reference my news Nation interview and I talk about a multi-decade you know campaign to um just enfranchise public interest basically yeah apologize for Mr chairman I yield back negative 21 seconds thank you Ms oh come here ocasio-cortez uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you to our Witnesses for coming here today um I do concur with the ranking members well as several other members here on this committee that this is a committee for whistleblowers and for the protection of whistleblowers as well so we understand what you're putting um on the table here and we're putting on the line here and we thank you for that uh Mr Crush you sat on the unidentified anomalous phenomenon task force created in the 2020 ndaa correct yes there have been some things that uh that have been mentioned here during this hearing that I wanted to pick up on um Mr Graves you mentioned specifically during the answer to one of your questions you named Boeing contractors being engaged in an incident regarding this Red Cube about a football a football field wide I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the interaction or Mr gresh either of you the interactions between defense contractor companies and any UAP related programs or activities so I'll just say that the information about the contractor themselves were provided by a witness and I have no particular detail in that relationship Mr gresh the kind of General unclass wave tops certainly the contractors you know or the metal Benders so to speak the ones actually uh doing specific performance on government contracts are they required um to issue any disclosure regarding UAP sightings or do they engage in any reporting around this uh in terms of the contractors not that I'm aware of they do not okay now when it comes to notification that you had mentioned about um irap program I read programs we have seen defense contractors abuse their contracts before through this committee I have seen it personally and I have also seen the notification requirements to Congress abused um I am wondering one of the loopholes that we see in the law is that there is at least from my vantage point is that depending on what we're seeing is that there are no actual definitions or requirements for notification are there what methods of notification Did You observe like when they say they notified Congress how did they do that do you have insight into that for certain irad activities I can only think of one's conventional in nature um sometimes they throw flow through certain out of say sap programs that have cognizant authority over the Air Force or something and those are congressionally reported compartments but ired is literally internal to the contractor so as long as it's money either profits private investment Etc to put a finer point on it when there is a requirement for any agency or company to notify or any agency to notify Congress do they contact the chairman of a committee do they get them on the phone specifically is this through an email to hypothetically a dead email box a lot of it comes through what they call the PPR periodic program review process if it's a you know a sap or controlled Access program equity and then those go to the specific committees whether it be the SAS task to see thank you um I apologize I just my time is limited um it Mr Graves one of your main concerns that the FAA currently does not have an official process to receive reports of UAP from Pilots or others correct correct and um in your experience what data should the Aero program prioritize for potential collection we have you know location date time but are there other specific active characteristics that should be included in these reports certainly I think that there's two categories that would be important one would be kinematics and understanding the specifics of how the vehicle or objects are moving and the second would be a more zoomed out approach of being able to look at origin and destination after before the incident as well as getting a better contextual understanding of how these uh these objects are acting with each other thank you now I have a minute left I apologize we only have five minutes today but um for the record if you were me where would you look titles programs departments regions if you could just name anything and I put that as an open question to the three of you I'd be happy to give you that in a closed environment I can tell you specifically thank you um Commander fraver I would say and I've told people that you have to know where to look they're not going to divulge it to you because the classification levels but if you know where to look and who to talk to which is exactly Mr Gresham point you then you then you have them okay Mr Graves I was an operator so I was defending on folks like Mr garage to do that homework okay thank you very much are yield back to the chair Mr Biggs thanks thanks Mr chairman I think the witnesses for being here today I'm over here thank you so much for being here um I I want to get into uh specifics here and and the reason I'm going to go this way is because you've talked a bit about um what I would call misdirection by official U.S government with regard to uaps right and so I'm going to get to that in a second but last week White House Tennessee spokesman John Kirby stated that uaps are having an impact on our training ranges and need to be treated as a legitimate issue do you concur with the statements that's for each of you yes yes okay um now having said that I'm going to take you to specific instances around the Phoenix Valley because that's where I I live and in 97 we had the famous Phoenix light case I don't know if any of you are familiar with that there were there were two things that went along with that and the explanation was military training range off Luke and the Barry Goldwater range do you know anything different other than the official explanation of those lights only what's in the public vernacular about it that was outside the scope of my duties and if we wanted to just my question along with my colleague from New York Miss ocasio-cortez if we wanted to find out more about that where would we go to find the files and who where and who would we address and are you gonna tell me we need to go to this gift so you can tell us in this gift I could potentially give you a vector on that that specific case I'm not I mean I'm familiar with it in terms of public but uh I I give you a vector in closed environment yeah that would be good thank you so if if it's true that uaps are having an impact on training ranges and this Administration considers it to be a legitimate issue what steps can Congress take to address training range impacts and I say that having two very large training ranges in my state and so we'll start with Mr gravesen going down the panel some of the initial procedures have been implemented such as within the United States Navy that have a range Fowler report that gathers information from Pilots I understand that a service-wide reporting mechanism is still pending however that would be a great Next Step not only for gathering information but for showing the troops that is an acceptable topic and reducing the stigma okay please all of you continue yeah as a recipient of a lot of those training range reports sometimes we only get contextual kind of oral reporting it'd be nice if they attached all sensor data and there's a system in place that can handle multiple classifications of data and that's an issue with the F-35 right that jet was never built to be an ISR platform and it's a pain in the we'll say but to get that data off so yeah great thank you yeah I would agree with the previous two being a user of those training ranges that the data has to be out there you have to acknowledge that you're seeing them and then you have to collect the data right now you get the report someone says I saw something but no one collects the radar data to back it up and do research okay do you believe that the 2019 classification guidelines for uip's interferes with the federal government's ability to be transparent with the American people and do you think we need to be more transparent with the American people all of you yeah I'll say yes to that familiar with the the at least the UAP task force 2019 security classification guide I think it's fair um I did actually help uh author that with the oh yeah you got a bias that way but I will say uh I'll call it a lazy attitude about declassifying videos I mean I've seen some of the videos of you know the recent shoot down and I saw no reason that couldn't have been released as long as they mask you know some data the American people deserve to see that that imagery and full motion video uh I would think well in my opinion I will say things are overclassified I know for a fact the video or the pictures that came out in the 20 things 2020 report that had the stuff off the east coast they were taken with an iPhone off the east coast a buddy of mine was one of the senior people there and he said they're originally classified a tssci and my question to him was what's tssci about these they're an iPhone right literally off the vacapes that's not tssci so they're over classified and as soon as they do that they go in a vault and then you all have to look for them yeah so with the over classification that may be one way are there other ways that the dod or intelligence agencies are keeping this information from the American people or even from Congress I think part of that has been uh not encouraging reporting if the problem is not something that can be measured it's not something that's going to be fixed okay very good with I'm out of time and I thank you Mr chairman and now you'll bet uh first of all without objection representative Nick Langworthy of New York has waved on the subcommittee for purpose of questioning Witnesses in today's subcommittee hearing and then we go to Mr Burleson thank you Mr chairman um appreciate you guys coming out today testifying look I've been here for six months and I'm pretty skeptical I don't trust anything in this town and um and so I and I think that's because I'm from Missouri you've got to show me right um with that being said um there's been a lot of things that have been said um in in the public uh Mr grush and and so I want to get down this if we can some specifics right so um at one point you had said that they're they're they're uh has been harmful activity or Progressive activity has any of the activity um been aggressive been hostile in your reports uh I know of multiple colleagues of mine that got physically injured and uh the activity and I had to if I buy uaps or buy people within the federal government both okay so there has been activity by by alien or non-non-human technology and or beings that has caused harm to humans uh I can't get into the specifics in an open environment but at least the activity that I personally witnessed not to be very careful here because you don't you know they tell you never to acknowledge tradecraft right so what I personally witness myself and my wife was very disturbing okay um one of my constituents actually sent this next question and I figured I'd ask it since I had the same thought you've said that U.S and has intact spake spacecraft you said that the government has alien bodies or alien species have you seen have you have you seen the spacecraft I have to be careful to describe what I've seen firsthand and not in this environment but I could answer that question behind behind closed doors and have you seen any of the bodies that's something I've I've not witnessed myself okay and so with that being said you know and the other statement that has been made that was intriguing to me because and it's intriguing because my my view has been that we are billions of light years away from any any other system and the concept that an alien species that's technologically advanced enough to travel billions of light years gets here and somehow is incompetent enough to not survive Earth or crashes is is something that I find a little bit far-fetched and with that being said you have mentioned that there's interdimensional potential could you expound on that oh yeah to answer your first question and you know I'm here as a fact witness an expert but I will give you a a theoretical framework at least to work off to kind of expose uh crashes uh regardless of uh you know your level of sentience right you know planes crash cars crash and number of sorties what however High a small percentage are going to end in you know Mission failure if you will as we say in the air force uh and then in terms of uh multi-dimensionality that kind of thing the the framework that I'm familiar with for example is something called the holographic principle uh both uh it's it drives itself from general relativity and quantum mechanics and that is if you want to imagine uh 3D objects such as yourself casting a shadow onto a 2d surface that's the holographic principle so you can be projected quasi-projected from higher dimensional space to lower dimensional it's a scientific Trope that you can actually cross literally as far as I understand but there's probably guys with phds that we can probably argue about that but you have not seen any documentation that that's what's occurring uh only a theoretical framework discussion okay um okay Occam's razor my is that this these aircraft um have they been identified that they are being produced by by domestic um you know military and um contractors is there any evidence that that's what's being recovered uh not to my knowledge plus the recoveries predate a lot of our Advanced programs that I previously I'm witting of so um would it be safe to say that there could be a scenario today where you have an aircraft that crashes and because it's been involved in one program from One Federal agency and the but the but the agency that retrieves it is not aware of that program and to them it appears alien in origin I mean that's a hypothetical situation I'm not aware of any uh historical situation that would match that that you described so you're not aware it has not happened that you're aware of that I'm aware of um thank you Mr chairman I yield back several months ago my office received a protected disclosure from Eglin Air Force Base indicating that there was a UAP incident that required my attention I sought a briefing regarding that episode and brought with me congressman burchett and congresswoman Luna we asked to see any of the evidence that had been taken by flight crew in this endeavor and to observe any radar signature as long as as well as to meet with the flight crew we were not afforded access to all of the flight crew and initially we were not afforded access to images and to radar thereafter we had a bit of a discussion about how authorities flow in the United States of America and we did see the image and we did meet with one member of the flight crew who took the image the image was of something that I am not able to attach to any human capability either from the United States or from any of our adversary and I'm somewhat informed on the matter having served on the armed services committee for seven years having served on the committee that oversees DARPA and Advanced Technologies for several years um when we spoke with the flight crew and when he showed us the photo that he'd taken I asked why the video wasn't engaged why we didn't have a FLIR system that worked here's what he said they were out on a test mission that day over the Gulf of Mexico and when you're on a test mission you're supposed to have clear air space not supposed to be anything that shows up and they saw a sequence of four craft in a clear diamond formation for which there is a radar sequence that I and I alone have observed in the United States Congress one of the pilots goes to check out that diamond formation and sees a large floating what I can only describe as an orb again like I said not of any human capability that I'm that I'm aware of and when he approached he said that his radar went down he said that his flear system malfunctioned and that he had to manually take this image from one of the lenses and it was not automatic automated in collection as you would typically see in a test mission so uh I guess I'll start with Commander fraver what in how should we think about the fact that this craft that was approached by our pilot uh had the capability of disarming a number of the sensor and collection systems on that craft well I think this goes to that National Security side and you can go back through history of things showing up in certain areas and disabling our capabilities which is disheartening and for us I mean like I said it it completely disabled the radar and aircraft when I try to do it the only way we could see it is passively which is how he got that image so I think that's a that's a concern on what are these doing not only how do they operate but their capabilities inside to do things like this and and how should we think about for craft moving in a very clear formation equidistant from one another in a diamond in all of the phenomenon perhaps Mr grave that you've analyzed um have we ever seen multiple craft in a single formation I have one particular case and that was uh during the gimbal incident the recording on the at FLIR system shows a single object that rotates um you hear the pilots refer to a fleet of objects that is not visible on the FLIR system and that was something that I witnessed during the debrief as part of the radar data on the situational awareness page I would like to add whoever Congressman there's a small uh small bit of a uh anger I would say I would feel that those Pilots are still uh facing that difficulty in reporting this topic and they don't have the tools to be able to mitigate this issue it just goes to show how serious this is and why this is such an important issue for our pilots and foreign Nation it was stated explicitly to me by these test pilots that if you have a u of AP experience the best thing you can do for your career is forget it and not tell anyone because any type of reporting either above the surface or below the surface does have a perceived consequence to these people and that is a culture we must change if we want to get to the truth Mr chairman I I would observe that perhaps as we as we move forward from this hearing there are some obvious next steps every person watching this knows that we need to meet with Mr grush in a secure compartmentalized facility so that we can get fulsome answers that do not put him in Jeopardy and that and that give us the information we need second I would suggest that the radar images from that were collected of this formation of craft out of Eglin Air Force Base and specifically the actual image taken by the actual flight crew that we can actually validate be provided to the committee subpoenaed if necessary so that we're able to track how to get this type of reporting and Analysis done in a more fulsome way that would be my recommendation humbly as a guest here of the fine oversight committee I yield back Ms Mason thank you Mr chairman and good morning to our Witnesses who are testifying today I want to thank each of you for being here to discuss a topic of grave importance to our national security earlier this year Chinese spy balloon was shot down off the coast of my home state of South Carolina since the Roswell incident in 1947 many Americans have wondered about the dangers of unknown objects crisscrossing our skies whether these are uaps or weather phenomena advanced technology from American allied or enemy forces or something more out of this world so my first question I have several questions and I'll I if we can just be quick on these first two I'm going to ask each of you the same question and then I'll get to each of you individually the first one when you reported your experiences with a UAP did any of you face any repercussions with your superiors yes or no no I've actually never seen anything personally believe it or not so all right and then do do you believe there's an active disinformation campaign within our government to deny existence of uaps yes or no I don't have an answer to that as previous previously stated publicly yes I think previously with like Project Blue Book yes but currently I don't speak for the United States government okay thank you um I have a few questions for Mr Graves what percentage of UAP sightings in your belief go unreported by our Pilots this is an approximation based off of my personal experience speaking with a number of Pilots but I would estimate we're somewhere near five percent reporting perhaps so like 95 basically don't report seeing UAP that's just my personal estimate um in the incident off Virginia Beach do you believe the Navy took the danger to your aircraft seriously after it was reported absolutely a few questions for Mr favor as an expert Naval aviator have you ever seen an object that looked and moved like the Tic Tac UAP did the Tic Tac UAP move in such a way that defied the laws of physics the way we understand them yes many dismissed UAP reports as classified weapons testing by our own government but in your experience as a pilot does our government typically test Advanced weapon systems right next to multi-million dollar Jets without informing our Pilots no we have test ranges for that it took over 15 years for your encounter with the Tic Tac to be Declassified do you feel there was a good reason to prevent lawmakers from having access to this footage no I just think it was ignored when it happened and it just sat somewhere in a file never got reported in a drawer it happens a lot up here shocker Mr gresh a couple of questions for you too sir this morning what percentage of uaps do you feel are adequately investigated by the US government of the five percent that are reported um I can only speak for my personal leadership over at NGA I tried to look at every report that came through that I could triage so do you believe that officials at the highest levels of our national security apparatus have unlawfully withheld information from Congress and subverted our oversight Authority there are certain elected leaders that had more information that I'm not sure what they've shared with certain gang of eight members or Etc but uh certainly I would not be surprised okay you've stated that the government possession of potentially non -hit craft based on your experience and extensive conversations with experts do you believe our government has made contact with intelligent extraterrestrials something I can't discuss in public setting um okay and I can't ask when you think this occurred if you believe we have crashed craft stated earlier do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft as I've stated publicly already in my news Nation interview biologics came with some of these recoveries yeah um human biologics non-human and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program in was this documentary references video photos eyewitness like how would that be determined the specific documentation I would have to talk to you in a skiff about gotcha um okay so and you may or may not be able to answer my last question and maybe we get into a skiff at the next hearing that we have but who in the government either what agency sub-agency what contractors who should be called into the next hearing about uaps either in a public setting or even in a private setting and you probably can't name names but what agencies or organizations contractors Etc do we need to call in to get these questions answered whether it's about funding what programs are happening and what's out there I can give you a specific cooperative and hostile witness list of specific individuals that were in those and how soon can we get that list I'm happy to provide that to you after the hearing super thank you and I yield back okay now we have Mr langworthy's here okay thank you very much uh I'd like to thank uh all of the witnesses for being here today uh to discuss this very unique topic and I'd like to jump right into my questions if you don't mind uh Commander fraver can you briefly describe your background yeah
