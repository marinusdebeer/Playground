left the Pentagon in protest and joined forces with Tom Delong Chris melon Steve Justice and others to form two stars Academy an organization that pressed the issue with leading industry experts and U.S government officials they worked with Leslie Keane who was present today Rob Blumenthal and Helene Cooper to publish the articles in the New York Times 2017 New York Times and it removed the stigma on the topic of UFOs which is why we're here today those articles opened the door for the government and public that cannot be closed it has led to an interest from our elected officials who are not focused on Little Green Men but figuring out where these crafts are where they from the technology they possess how do they operate it also led to the Whistleblower protection act in the ndaa there are multiple Witnesses coming forward to say uh that have first-hand knowledge and Mr grush has covered that what concerns me is that there's no oversight from our elected officials on anything associated with our government processing or working on Craft I believe not from this world this issue is not a full public disclosure that could undermine National Security but it is about ensuring that our system of checks and balances Works across all work done in the government using taxpayer funds relative to government programs even unacknowledged wave programs have some level of oversight by the appropriate committee members in the House and Senate and this work that is said to be occurring from whistleblower testimonies should not be exempt in closing I would like to say that the Tic Tac object we engaged in 2004 was far superior to anything that we had on time have today or looking to develop in the next 10 years if we in fact have programs that possess this technology and needs to have oversight from those people that the citizens of this great country elected an office to represent what is best for the United States and best for the citizens I thank you for your time thank you very much thank you very much and it was very difficult for all of you all you've done in the past to try to illuminate this issue calling myself first for some questions I'm going to start with Mr graves are your Pilots our Pilots that you interact with as part of your organization do you feel adequately trained and briefed on how to handle encounters with uaps no right now uh military witnesses to UAP have limited options for reporting UAP but more more concerning is that commercial uh Aviation sector has not adapted to the lessons that the military has implemented um the military and Department of Defense has stated that UAP represent a critical Aviation safety risk we have not seen that that same that same language being used in the commercial markets they are not acknowledging this risk okay what steps do you think you have to be taken to improve a pilot's UAP reporting be it military or commercial right now we need a system where Pilots can report without fear of losing their jobs there is a fear that the stigma associated with this topic is going to lead to professional repercussions either through management or perhaps through their yearly physical check so having a secure system reducing the stigma and making this available this information available through the public is going to reduce the concerns that aircrew have could you just give me a little idea that the degree to which reports in the past are are not made public right now well I don't think there has been a proper reporting system to gather those reports and thus not report them so to answer your question I think there is a dearth of data due to the fact that the reporting has been limited up to this time could you tell me why you believe it's kind of play The Devil's Advocate a reason why some of this stuff should not be available to the public there's certainly some National Security concerns when we use our Advanced sensors and our tactical Jets to be able to identify these these objects however there's no reason that the objects themselves would be classified I would be curious to see how the security classification guideline actually spells out the different nuances of how this topic is classified from the from the perspective of UAP not National Security I'll give you a follow-up on that assuming that there are reasons why not all this should be made public this has been around for a long period of time um can you think of can any of the three of you think of any reason why anything related to uaps say 15 years and back should not be immediately made public one of it is uh acknowledging a vulnerability both from a collection and I'll just say A you know countermeasure perspective so it's uh no we haven't cracked for many years yeah even say 20 years back is there any reason why when you go back that far things shouldn't be made public unless it shows a specific National Security vulnerability as it relates to a weakness and particular defenses okay Mr fravor the Tic Tac incident that you and that with that you were engaged occurred in 2004 what kind of reporting took place after that incident a standard debrief where the back seaters went down to our carrier Intel Center and briefed what had happened and that was it no one else talked to us and I was in the top 20 in the battle group no one came that Captain was aware Admiral was aware nothing was done you're commanding officers provide any sort of justification no because I was a commanding officer of the Squadron so no was this incident the only UAP event that you encountered while you were a pilot yes it was okay um this is for any one of you based on based off of each of your experiences and observations do you believe uaps pose a Potential Threat to our national security yes and here's why the the technology that we faced was far superior than anything that we had and you could put that anywhere if you if you had one you captured one you reverse engineered it you got it to work you're talking something can go into space go someplace drop down in a matter of seconds do whatever it wants and leave and there's nothing we can do about it nothing okay either the other YouTube I would also like to add from commercial Aviation and Military Aviation perspective we deal with uncertainty in our operating space as a matter of of our protection professional actions identifying friend from foe is very important to us and so when we have unidentified targets and we continue to ignore those due to a stigma or a fear of what it could be that's an opening that our adversaries can take advantage of what what uh steps should we take in to better understand and respond to UAP Encounters in the interest of National Security there needs to be a location where this information is centralized for processing and there needs to be a two-way communication Loop so the operators on the front end have a feedback and can can get best practices on how to process information what to do and to ensure that they they their reporting is being listened to right now there's not a lot of back and forth Mr gresh in your complaint to the intelligence Community inspector you Inspector General you claim that you believe information is being hidden what kind of information do you think was hidden and do you think it should remain hidden very briefly an unclassified manner as you know the preponderance of my complaint was classified to the intelligence communities uh both material acquisition and exploitation activity also baselining the uaps but not sharing it with you know intelligence professionals that are actually doing step briefs to Pilots uh that that kind of information yeah okay thank you very much now we'll go to Mr Garcia thank you um again thank you all for for your service and for testifying today um I want to just uh talk about the uap's relates to what we're seeing in the Pilot's interaction with uaps particularly Mr Graves one of the I think concerns that for members of this committee is this idea that Pilots there's no system to actually report uaps and the stigma around pilots and so could you can you just briefly you mentioned that there are you working with 30 Pilots right now that have had encounters with uaps uh but you've also I believe I'm discussed and know of many more pilots this is just those that you're currently working with is that correct can you expand on that certainly I'll break that down in two ways first when we were first experiencing these objects off the Eastern Seaboard in the 2014 to 2015 time period anyone that had upgraded their radar systems were seeing these objects so there was a large number of my colleagues that were detecting these objects off the Eastern Seaboard they were further correlating that information with the other onboard centers and many of them also had their own on eyesightings as well of these objects now that was our personal first firsthand experience at the time since then as I've engaged this topic others have reached out to me they share their experiences both on the military side as well as a commercial Aviation side on the military Aviation side veterans that have recently got out have shared their stories and have expressed how the objects we were seeing in 2014 2015 continued all the way to 2019 2020 and Beyond and so it became a generational issue for Naval aviators on the Eastern Seaboard this was something we are briefing to new students this is something that was included in the notice to Airmen to ensure that there was no uh accidents and now with commercial aviators they are reaching out because they're having somewhat similar experiences as our military brothers and sisters but they do not have any reporting system that they can send this to and let me just add both to to Mr fravor as well as Mr Graves not having this system for for reporting would you degree that is harmful to not just our national security interests but to understand this phenomenon of what's happening with uaps I think it's it's uh it's a it's actually it's a travesty that we don't have a system to correlate this and actually investigate you know so if you took the East Coast you know there's there's Coastal Radars out there that monitor our air defense identification zone so out to 200 miles uh they can track these you know so when you see them they can actually go and pull that data and and get maneuvering and instead of just having the airplanes there's other data sources out there and I've talked to other government officials on this so you need a centrally located repository that these reports go to so if you just stuck it in dod you wouldn't get anything out of the intelligence committee because they have a tendency not to talk but if you had a central location where these reports would come in not just military but also commercial Aviation because there's a lot of that going on especially if you talk to anyone that flies from here to Hawaii over the Pacific they see odd lights so I think you need to develop something that allows you a central point to collect the data in order to investigate Mr Graves I will concur with everything Mr fraver said I'll continue to say that the commercial pilots that have reached out to me through Americans for safe Aerospace are doing so because they don't feel there's another way for them to report their safety issue and I think one of the clear outcomes of this hearing already is that there has to be a safe and transparent reporting process for Pilots both on the commercial side and the military side to be able to report uaps in a way that's also transparent but also understands the scope of our of our national security interests and what uh may be classified or not but I think there has to be some sort of system and so that's something that I hope can be an outcome that this committee can can work on uh is there anything else for just for the two of you briefly Beyond this reporting system that you think that we can do as a government to encourage and facilitate more civilian reporting I'm just doing it right now okay great I think this hearing is is going to show the American people that their government takes this topic seriously and how civilians that may not be Pilots what kind of process could be in place for civilians who are not pilots who may have UAP encounters do either of you have any suggestions that could facilitate that my recommendations would make would be to make that a sense a sensor Centric operation in order to make it as objective as possible okay sir Mr favor no I agree with Mr Graves on that okay um just just briefly I also just want to um note for particularly for the two pilots that have a question for Mr grush one of the things that I found fascinating in our discussion Mr Graves last night as well is that you've both described um uaps and formations and the way they have they they they are observed in space or or in our air and the way that they move essentially um ways in which current technology or aircraft that we know of are unable to actually function or move and so will you just for the public record again once once again um just uh briefly uh just either describe or note that aircraft are being witnessed particularly by the 30 folks that you're working with are essentially outside the scope of anything that we know of today in the technology we have today Mr graves Mr favor yes the objects that are being seen by commercial pilots are performing Maneuvers that are unexplainable due to our current understanding of our technology and our capabilities as a country and that applies for the military as well Mr yeah I concur with that we have nothing that can stop in midair and go the other direction nor do we have anything that can like in our situation come down from space hang out for three hours and go back up thank you my last question and so and sometimes you I know that some you have also said some of these answers in the past we're trying to get them on the public record as well which is really important Mr gresh finally do you believe that our government is in possession of uaps absolutely based on interviewing uh over 40 Witnesses over four years and and where I know the exact locations and those locations were provided to the Inspector General and some of which to the intelligence committees I actually had the people with the first-hand knowledge um provide a protected disclosure to the Inspector General thank you and Mr chairman I would just say that I think that these questions are important questions and I look forward to being involved in the process to get those answered I know there'll be a lot of questions from the committee members so I yield back thank you we'll go to Mr Richard himself thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Garcia I would like to have you on the my legislation to do just that on the on the reporting um and we'll get together on that maybe it could be my co-sponsor on that that'd be really cool thank you for those great questions um Mr Graves again I'd like to know how do you know that these were not our aircraft some of the behaviors that we saw in a working area we would see these objects being at 0.0 Mach that's zero airspeed over certain pieces of the ground so what that means just like a river if you throw a bobber in it's going to float Downstream these objects were staying completely stationary and category 4 hurricane winds these same objects would then accelerate to supersonic speeds 1.1 1.2 Mach and they would do so in very erratic and quick behaviors that we don't I don't have an explanation for it okay have you spoken to Commercial and Military Pilots that have seen these off of our East Coast I have okay um Mr Fiverr I noticed that um um in the Tic Tac video uh it's Tic Tac like the candy not Tick Tock like the Chinese Communist uh app that's correct yes sir I just want to make that because my daughter uh corrected me on that and called me a boomer and say Boomer and I said no baby it's Tic Tac like the candy you're gonna have to just look it up and um but now I would love what I like to say today is a is a day of many first it's a miracle that we're having this this meeting and it's also a miracle that my wife has put up with me for nine years today today is my anniversary so I want to tell my wife happy anniversary and that I love her very much um as she likes to say this nine years have been the best two years of her life so thank you um Mr favor what what astonished you the most about the the flight capabilities of these Tic Tacs very briefly uh the performance absolute performance it was and you're you're not aware of any other objects that anybody in the world has in this world that has those capabilities no I think it's far beyond actually our Material Science that we currently possess are you aware of any other reconnaissance platforms that attract or recorded the Tic Tacs Maneuvers maybe the NORAD system or any of the others I am not okay Mr grosh thank you for being here brother thank you all very much um have you faced any retaliation or arrivals for any of your testimony or anything on these lines yeah uh I have to be careful what I say in detail because there is an open uh whistleblower reprisal investigation on my behalf and I don't want to compromise that investigation by providing anything that may uh help provide somebody information but it was very brutal and very unfortunate some of the tactics they used to hurt me both professionally and and personally to be quite Frank yeah it's very unfortunate as they say when you're over the target that's when they do the most firing at you do you have any personal knowledge of people who've been harmed or injured in efforts to cover up or conceal these extraterrestrial technology yes personally have you heard have anyone been murdered that you would think that you know of or have heard of I guess I have to be careful asking that question I directed people with that knowledge to the appropriate authorities maybe in a um if we could get it get in a confidential area skiff we could talk about that but unfortunately we were denied access to the skiff and that's very unfortunate in this in this scenario um Mr favor do you believe that you witnessed an additional object under the water in relation to your encounter I will say we did not see an object there was something there to cause the white water and when we turned around it was gone so there was something there that obviously moved okay it was it was not the same object though that you were you were looking at correct no we actually joked that the Tic Tac was communicating with something when we came back and because of white water disappeared we were in another instance we're told about the capabilities of a jamming during viewing of some when there were some people chasing some of these objects did you experience any of that jamming or interrupting your radar or weapon system my crew that launched after we landed experienced significant jamming today apg-73 radar which was what we had on board which is a mechanically scanned very high-end system prior to the apg-79 and yes it did pretty much everything you could do range velocity aspect and then it hit the lock and the targeting pod is passive that's what we're able to get the video on I'm about to run out of time but um are you aware of any of our enemies that have that capability okay I would also like to note for the record that um like George Knapp breaking Area 51 he's the reason I knew about that and the reason I know about the Tic Tacs is uh is Leslie Kane from New York Times article and I would encourage everybody to read that thank you Mr chairman yield back to you for no time very good Mr Raskin thank you Mr chairman um Mr Graves um you reported UAP encounters um during training flights I think and have since come forward to warn the Pentagon that uh these encounters may be putting Pilots at risk um my first question is um you've identified these as taking place on the east coast is it just on the East Coast where these encounters uh have been reported no since the events initially occurred I've learned that the objects have been detected essentially where uh all operations Navy operations are being conducted across the world and that's from uh the ultimate anomaly resolutions office reporting all right can you describe your experience after you decided to come forward and um go public with your um experience certainly like many others in 2017 I saw the New York Times article come out as well and for me it was it was special because I recognized the voices on the video I recognized the video itself I had seen it when it was taken I seen it when it was debriefed and so that was kind of shook me because I realized that this problem was still ongoing and so I reached out to colleagues back on the east coast and realized that this was still a safety risk that they were dealing with that they had essentially hit a wall with how they could move forward on this conversation it was at that point when I decided to try to move the conversation forward myself um are there common characteristics to the uaps that have been cited by different pilots and can you describe what the convergence of descriptions is certainly we were primarily seeing dark gray or black cubes inside of a clear sphere I'm sorry dark gray or black cubes yes inside of a clear sphere where the Apex or tips of the cube were touching the inside of that sphere and that was primarily what was being reported when we were able to gain a visual tally of these objects that occurred over almost eight years and as far as I know it's still occurring [Music] um so the I take it that you're arguing what we need is real transparency in a reporting system so we can get some clarity on what's going on out there because there are many pilots in your situation um but we should have a way of developing assist systematic inventory of all of such encounters is that right yes and I think we need both transparency and the reporting we have the reporting but we need to make sure that information can be promulgated to commercial Aviation as well as the rest of the populace um Mr Crush what about you what was your experience after you came forward well uh it's only been about two months or so so I guess my experience has been overwhelming support from uh former colleagues of mine that have you know privately messaged me and and I do appreciate that uh but I I do have knowledge of um active planned reprisal activity against myself and other colleagues and it's very very upsetting to me coming from where uh certain senior leadership at previous agencies I was associated with and that's all I'll say publicly but I can provide more details in a closed environment okay well I I hope you understand that um there would be bipartisan rejection of any attempt uh to vilify demonize or engage in other reprisals against our Witnesses and people who are telling the truth from their perspective yeah there were certain colleagues of mine that were brutally administratively attacked and it you know actually makes me very upset to as a leader to see that happen to other co-workers and actually superiors of mine over the last three years how do you account for that response that seems like a bizarre response I call it administrative terrorism that's their their quiver their tool in the toolbox to silence people especially you know the career government service cares about their career cares about their clearance uh their reputation to climb the ladder and when you threaten that uh flow career path a lot of people back off but I'm here to represent those people so um Mr fravor what about you um what has your experience been since you've come forward with your perspective on this actually I've been treated very well and the six people that were involved myself included all of them have or will be retiring from the military as 0506s and all my friends that are very senior three and four stars I've talked to them they they believe they understand there's a problem but no I was actually treated really well and and what is your general interpretation um of these phenomena or what is your current thinking of trying to make sense of them well I'll say you know I'm not like a UFO fanatic it's not it's not me but I will tell you that what we saw with four sets of eyes over a five minute period still there's nothing we have nothing close to it it was it was amazing to see I told my buddy I wanted to fly it but yeah it's just an incredible technology all right Mr chairman thank you very much I yield back to you uh thanks and Ms Luna Mr grush in speaking to you yesterday um I just wanted to follow up on representative raskin's questions in the last couple of years have you had incidences that have caused you to be in fear for your life for addressing these issues yes personally yeah I just want everyone to note that he's coming forward in fear of his life to put in perspective if they were really not scared about this information coming out why would someone be intimidated like that um to your knowledge our nhis working with adversarial foreign governments in either technology exchange programs or back engineering programs I don't have data on that I'm not sure have you heard or you had people come forward to present that evidence not that particular evidence that you just exposed okay on the 19th of April Dr Kirkpatrick head of Arrow had said that he did not find any evidence of uaps you also stated that you had in your interview that you had briefed him on information that you were uncovering but that he did not follow up with you were the items that you divulged to him important to National Security yes him and I had a classified conversation in April 2022 before he took over arrow in the July to 2022 and I provided him some concerns I had do you know why he might not have fallen up with you uh unfortunately I cannot read his mind I wish she did I was I was happy to give Sage counsel to him on where to look when he took the Helm of Arrow okay and then my last question for you before I moved to Mr Graves is um you received prior approval from the defense department to speak on certain issues correct correct through uh dobster DOD pre-publication and Security review and I just want to remind the public uh they're just looking from a security perspective uh these are my own personal views and opinions uh not the Departments okay so it does bring a certain amount of credibility to your testimony I'm required by law to do that as a Former Intelligence officer or I go to jail for revealing classified information we don't want you to go to jail um my next question would actually be for Mr Graves can you please explain to me in detail the event that occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base certainly in the 2003 time frame a large group of Boeing contractors were operating near one of the launch facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base when they observed a very large 100 yard sided uh ready Square approached the base from the ocean and hover at low altitude over one of the launch facilities um this object remained for about 45 seconds or so before darting off over the mountains there was a similar event within 24 hours later in the evening this was a morning event I believe 8 45 in the morning later in the evening post sunset there were reports of other sightings on base including some aggressive behaviors these objects were approaching some of the security guards at rapid speeds before darting off and this is information that was received through one of the witnesses that have approached me at Americans for safe Aerospace was this documented in any official form whether it was a police blotter yes they had official documentation and records from the event that they witness held over the years and I'm not going to ask you to do it right now for time reasons but you would be able to sketch what was when it's correct and you've have you seen that before on any other equipment and or during your flight time I have not seen what they've described this object was estimated to be almost the size of a football field and I have not seen anything personally that large okay and then um another question on follow-up referencing the gimbal video go fast incident um can you just clarify because to our understanding the footage was actually cut off at a certain point but what happens at the end of that video just for those Americans specifically there that are wanting to know about the rest of that footage certainly uh there was some uncertainty or um instability with the object it seemed to rock a bit and that's the last uh last size you know the video much of the data that I would recommend be analyzed would consist of radar data that would provide precise kinematics on the object as well as the fleet of objects that were operating nearby okay regards to the reporting for the dress on as well as representative burchett with the FAA to your understanding Pilots that are seeing this commercial airline pilots are they receiving cease and desist letters from corporations for coming forward with information in regards to safety for potential airline passengers I have been made privy to uh conversations with commercial aviators who have received Seasons assist orders so the American public should know that corporations are putting their own reputations on the basic not the line but ahead of the safety of the American people and I think would you agree with that statement appears so okay um I guess this would be my last I'm out of time I yield I'll be back good Mr Moskowitz uh thank you Mr chairman uh Gentlemen let's talk about the laws of physics for a second uh Mr Graves and and Commander favor I heard you talk about speed when those objects broke uh the sound barrier did they make a sonic boom I was in a jet you can't hear anything it's kind of loud in there yeah you're not able to actually uh personally tell within the vehicle I will say the objects that we were seeing they were spherical and they were observed up the Mach 2 which is a very in uh non-aerodynamic shape what about g-forces let's talk about g-forces of those Vehicles could a human survive those g-forces with known technology today no no not for the acceleration rates that we observed okay what about what they look like how close did you get did you see a seam or a rivet or a section and what I mean is obviously the Jets you're flying have all those things did these objects have those I didn't have I didn't have the detail to be able to tell that Barbara it's in airplanes that's actually relatively close no it was perfectly white smooth no windows although when we did take the original FLIR video that is out there when you put it on a big screen it actually had two little objects that came out of the bottom of it but other than that no no windows no seams no nothing Mr garage as a result of your previous government work have you met with people with direct knowledge or have direct knowledge yourself of non-human origin craft yes I personally interviewed those individuals Mr grush as a result of your previous government work have you met with people with direct knowledge or have direct knowledge yourself about ATS Advanced Technologies that the US government has uh based on conventional Advanced Tech I was brief to the preponderance of the defense Department's both space and Aerospace compartment of programs yeah do you have knowledge or do you have reason to believe that there are programs in the advanced Tech space that are unsanctioned uh yes I do okay yeah and and when you say that they're above congressional oversight what do you mean uh complicated question uh so there's you know some I would call it abuse here so Congressional oversight of conventional special access programs so I'll use title 10 so DOD as an example right so 10 U.S code section 119 discusses congressional oversight of saps discusses uh the the depth SEC def's ability to waive Congressional reporting however the gang of eight is at least supposed to be notified if a you know waived or wave bigoted unacknowledged sap is created and that's Public Law well so that how does I mean I don't want to cut you off but how does a program like that get funded I will give you generalities I can get very specific in a closed session uh but a misappropriation of funds and uh does that mean does that mean that there is money in the budget that is set to go to a program but it doesn't and it goes to something else yes I have specific knowledge of that yep do you think U.S corporations are over over charging for certain Tech they're selling to the US government and that additional money is going to programs correct through something called irad okay um satellite imagery let's talk about satellite imagery we have satellites all over the place some that we're aware of and many that we're not aware of right we're taking pictures of everything at every point in second uh Mr grush are you aware do you have direct knowledge or have you talk to people with direct knowledge that there are satellite imagery of these events uh that was one of my primary tasks at NGA since we uh process exploit and disseminate that kind of information I've seen multiple cases some of which to my understanding and of course I left NG in April so that's my information cut off date uh but I personally um reviewed both uh what we call Overhead collection and from other strategic and tactical platforms that were I could not even explain prosaically and I have a degree in physics by the way as well and I had I I'm aware that you guys have not seen these um reports unfortunately and I don't know why it is do you have direct knowledge we had spoken people with direct knowledge that this imagery applies to crash sites crash crash imagery I can't discuss that in an open session okay uh do you have any information that the US government is involved in a disinformation campaign to deny the existence of certain uaps I can't go beyond what I've already stated publicly in my news Nation interview because it touches other sensitivities okay I'll yield the balance of my time back thank you Mr chairman foreign thank you Mr chairman and I thank our Witnesses for being here today Mr garoosh in your sworn testimony you state that the United States government has retrieved supposedly extraterrestrial spacecraft and other UAP related artifacts you go so far as to state that the U.S is in possession of quote non-human spacecraft end quote and that some of these artifacts have circulated with defense contractors several other former military and intelligence officials have come forward with similar allegations albeit and non-public settings however Dr Sean Kirkpatrick the director of aaro previously testified before Congress that there has been and I quote no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity or of quote off-world technology brought to the attention of the office to your knowledge is that statement correct it's not accurate I believe Dr Kirkpatrick um mentioned he had about 30 individuals that have come to Arrow thus far a few of those individuals have also come to arrow that I also interviewed and I know what they provided Dr Kirkpatrick in their team okay I was able to evaluate okay information I need to go on sure but um my understanding that this his statement is accurate came from a direct quote and this contradiction is a perfect example of why we need to inject transparency into our government and for another example look no further than the pitiful
